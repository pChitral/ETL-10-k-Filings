59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2013,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionRESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewThis section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data is presented on a diluted basis.23Financial ResultsWorldwide total revenue decreased 7 percent to $22.60 billion in 2012, driven by steep sales declines for Zyprexa due to the loss of patent exclusivity in most major markets, partially offset by growth in certain other products. Net income and EPS decreased 6 percent to $4.09 billion and $3.66, respectively, in 2012 compared with net income of $4.35 billion and EPS of $3.90 in 2011. The decreases in net income and EPS were due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa, partially offset by growth in certain other products and higher other income from the early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation from Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin). The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2012 and 2011 financial results:2012Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $787.8 million (pretax), or $0.43 per share, related to the early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation following the completion of Amylin's acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).Asset Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $281.1 million (pretax), or $0.16 per share, consisting of an intangible asset impairment related to liprotamase, restructuring charges related to initiatives to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, charges associated with the decision to stop development of a delivery device platform, and charges related to changes in returns reserve estimates for the withdrawal of Xigris™.2011 Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We incurred acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim of $388.0 million (pretax), or $0.23 per share.Asset Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $316.4 million (pretax), or $0.24 per share, primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions to reduce our cost structure and global workforce.•We incurred a charge of $85.0 million (pretax), or $0.05 per share, primarily for returned product and contractual commitments related to the withdrawal of Xigris.Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have approximately 60 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in preclinical research.The following new molecular entities (NMEs) are currently in Phase III clinical trial testing for potential use in the diseases described. The quarter in which the NME initially entered Phase III for any indication is shown in parentheses:Baricitinib (Q4 2012)—a Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK 1 and JAK 2) inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (in collaboration with Incyte Corporation)Dulaglutide* (Q4 2008)—a long-acting analog of glucagon-like peptide 1 for the treatment of type 2 diabetesEdivoxetine (Q4 2010)—a norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of major depressionEmpagliflozin (Q3 2010)—a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim)24Enzastaurin (Q1 2006)—a serine-threonine kinase inhibitor that inhibits signaling within the protein kinase C beta (PKCß) and PI3K/AKT pathways for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)Evacetrapib (Q4 2012)—a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor for the treatment of high-risk vascular diseaseIxekizumab* (Q4 2011)—a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to interleukin-17A (IL-17) for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritisNecitumumab* (Q4 2009)—an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)New insulin glargine product (Q3 2011)—a new insulin glargine product for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim)Novel basal insulin analog* (Q4 2011)—a novel basal insulin for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes Ramucirumab* (Q4 2009)—an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of metastatic breast, gastric, liver, NSCLC, and colorectal cancersSolanezumab* (Q2 2009)—an anti-amyloid beta (Aß) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer’s diseaseTabalumab* (Q4 2010)—an anti-B-cell activating factor (BAFF) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus).* Biologic molecule subject to the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation ActThe following NME has been submitted for regulatory review for potential use in the disease described. The quarter the NME initially was submitted for any indication is shown in parenthesis:Liprotamase (Q1 2010)—a non-porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The following late-stage pipeline developments have occurred since January 1, 2012:Baricitinib—In November 2012, we initiated Phase III clinical trial testing.Dulaglutide—In October 2012, we announced positive top-line results of three completed Phase III AWARD trials (AWARD-1, AWARD-3, and AWARD-5) studying dulaglutide as a once-weekly treatment for type 2 diabetes. The primary efficacy endpoints, as measured by reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at the 1.5 mg dose, were met in all three studies. Having met the primary endpoints, superiority for HbA1c lowering was examined, and both doses of dulaglutide (0.75 mg and 1.5 mg) demonstrated statistically superior reduction in HbA1c from baseline compared to exenatide twice-daily injection at 26 weeks (AWARD-1); metformin at 26 weeks (AWARD-3); and sitagliptin at 52 weeks (AWARD-5). We anticipate filing for regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe in 2013.Empagliflozin—In January 2013, we announced positive top-line results for four completed Phase III clinical trials studying empagliflozin for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. In all four studies, the primary efficacy endpoint, defined as significant change in HbA1c from baseline compared to placebo, was met with empagliflozin (10 and 25 mg) taken once daily. The pivotal studies for empagliflozin completed in 2012, and we and Boehringer Ingelheim anticipate filing for regulatory review in the U.S., Europe, and Japan in 2013.Evacetrapib—In October 2012, we initiated Phase III clinical trial testing.Florbetapir—On April 6, 2012, the FDA approved Amyvid (florbetapir), a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for brain imaging of beta-amyloid plaques in patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive decline. In June 2012, Amyvid became available to a limited number of imaging centers. In January 2013, Amyvid was also approved by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for the European Union.25Ixekizumab—In January 2013, we initiated Phase III clinical trial testing for ixekizumab as a potential treatment for psoriatic arthritis.Liprotamase—We continue to engage in discussions with the FDA regarding future clinical trial requirements for liprotamase. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Necitumumab—We will assume sole worldwide development and commercialization rights to necitumumab following notice in the fourth quarter of 2012 from BMS to terminate the collaboration for necitumumab in North America and Japan. Novel basal insulin analog—In January 2013, we announced that we and Boehringer Ingelheim adjusted the scope of our collaboration, resulting in our reassuming the sole worldwide development and commercialization rights for the novel basal insulin analog. We also announced plans for the 2013 and 2014 initiation of the remainder of the pre-planned clinical trials for the molecule. These studies will be conducted to support regulatory submissions and evaluate safety, efficacy, and differentiation of the molecule. These studies are in addition to the five ongoing IMAGINE clinical trials.Pomaglumetad Methionil—In August 2012, we announced the decision to stop ongoing Phase III clinical studies investigating pomaglumetad methionil for the treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia. The decision was based on a lack of efficacy in two registration trials. The decision was not based on any safety signals.Ramucirumab—In October 2012, we announced that the REGARD trial, a Phase III study of ramucirumab as a second-line treatment in patients with metastatic gastric cancer, met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and its secondary endpoint of increased progression-free survival. We anticipate filing for regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe in 2013.Solanezumab—In August 2012, we announced that the primary endpoints, both cognitive and functional, were not met in either of the two Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled EXPEDITION trials in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. However, a pre-specified secondary analysis of pooled data across both trials showed a 34 percent reduction of cognitive decline in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. We plan to conduct an additional Phase III study of solanezumab in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Enrollment is expected to begin no later than the third quarter of 2013. Tabalumab—In February 2013, we announced our decision to discontinue the Phase III rheumatoid arthritis program for tabalumab due to lack of efficacy. The decision was not based on safety concerns. The tabalumab Phase III program for lupus is ongoing and will continue as planned.There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) and the introduction of new products. A high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development. The process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than $1 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success. Delays and uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products.We manage R&D spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total R&D spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the R&D process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our R&D projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful R&D project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated R&D expense. While we do accumulate certain R&D costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total R&D costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.26Legal, Regulatory, and Other MattersWe will lose U.S. patent protection for Cymbalta in December 2013 and for Evista in March 2014. See ""Financial Condition"" for additional information.The enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 brought significant changes to U.S. health care. These changes began to affect our financial results in 2010 and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future. Beginning in 2011, pharmaceutical drug manufacturers provided a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the ""doughnut hole"" (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage). Additionally, beginning in 2011, a non-tax-deductible annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. This fee is allocated to companies based on their prior-calendar-year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs. We recognized $170.7 million and $178.0 million as marketing, selling, and administrative expense related to this fee, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies’ revenue or increase expenses may be enacted. Certain other federal and state health care proposals, including state price controls, continue to be debated, and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices. These federal and state proposals, or state price pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Proposals for cost-containment measures are pending in a number of countries, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls, limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the value of our intellectual-property protection. Such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries.The Obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S.-based companies. There also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change the manner in which, and the rate at which, income of U.S. companies would be taxed. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, will continue to be a topic of discussion for Congress and the Obama administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.Operating Results—2012 RevenueOur worldwide revenue for 2012 decreased 7 percent, to $22.60 billion, driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets, partially offset by growth in Cymbalta, Forteo, Effient, Alimta, and our animal health portfolio. Worldwide sales volume decreased 7 percent and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue decline, partially offset by an increase of 2 percent due to higher prices. The decrease in volume was driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets, partially offset by volume gains for certain other products. Total revenue in the U.S. decreased 5 percent, to $12.31 billion, due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa, partially offset by higher prices and increased demand for certain other products. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 9 percent, to $10.29 billion, driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in markets outside of Japan, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates, and lower prices, partially offset by increased demand for certain other products.27The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2012 compared with 2011: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 PercentChange from ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total2011 (Dollars in millions) Cymbalta$3,917.8 $1,076.3 $4,994.1 $4,161.8 20Alimta1,122.4 1,471.9 2,594.3 2,461.1 5Humalog1,370.9 1,024.6 2,395.5 2,367.6 1Cialis782.2 1,144.6 1,926.8 1,875.6 3Zyprexa360.4 1,341.0 1,701.4 4,622.0 (63)Humulin592.1 647.0 1,239.1 1,248.8 (1)Forteo488.2 662.8 1,151.0 949.8 21Evista699.5 310.6 1,010.1 1,066.9 (5)Strattera384.1 237.3 621.4 620.1 —Effient339.0 118.2 457.2 302.5 51Other pharmaceutical products593.4 1,249.6 1,843.0 2,250.0 (18)Animal health products1,161.8 874.7 2,036.5 1,678.6 21Total net product sales11,811.8 10,158.6 21,970.4 23,604.8 (7)Collaboration and other revenue(2)501.3 131.7 633.0 681.7 (7)Total revenue$12,313.1 $10,290.3 $22,603.4 $24,286.5 (7)1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.2 Collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of royalties for Erbitux and revenue associated with exenatide in the United States. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia, increased 23 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices and, to a lesser extent, increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 9 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. We will lose effective exclusivity for Cymbalta in the U.S. in December 2013. Several manufacturers have received tentative approvals to market generic duloxetine, and we expect generic duloxetine to be introduced in the market immediately following the loss of exclusivity. While it is difficult to predict the precise impact on Cymbalta sales, we expect the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in our Cymbalta sales, which will have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 13 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. remained flat, as increased demand was offset by lower prices in Japan and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 2 percent in the U.S., due to increased government and commercial rebates as well as the product's removal from a large formulary in 2012. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, due to increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), increased 11 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand and higher prices.Sales of Zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance, decreased 83 percent in the United States. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 45 percent. The decreases were due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. and most major international markets outside of Japan, partially offset by growth in Japan. Zyprexa sales in Japan were approximately $585 million in 2012, compared to approximately $540 million in 2011.28Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, largely offset by decreased demand. U.S. sales of Humulin were negatively affected by the product's removal from a large formulary in 2012, as well as the continued decline in the market for human insulin and the termination of the Humulin ReliOn agreement with Walmart. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume.Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men, increased 8 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Sales outside the U.S. increased 33 percent, primarily due to the increased demand in Japan.Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, largely offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 14 percent, driven by decreased volume and, to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and in the U.S. in adults, decreased 2 percent in the U.S., due to decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased demand in Japan, partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Effient, a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention, including patients undergoing angioplasty, atherectomy, or stent placement, increased 52 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 47 percent, due to increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 30 percent, primarily due to increased demand for companion animal products. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain Janssen animal health assets in Europe (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), and the growth of other products, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 0.3 percentage points in 2012 to 78.8 percent. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales of Zyprexa and, to a lesser extent, higher miscellaneous manufacturing costs, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which decreased cost of sales in 2012 and increased cost of sales in 2011.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent in 2012 to $7.51 billion, driven by lower marketing expense resulting from our cost-containment efforts. Research and development expenses increased 5 percent to $5.28 billion, due to higher late-stage clinical trial costs.No acquired IPR&D charges were incurred in 2012, compared with $388.0 million in 2011, all of which was associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $281.1 million in 2012. These charges comprised $122.6 million related to an intangible asset impairment for liprotamase, $74.5 million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, $64.0 million related to the asset impairment of a product delivery device platform, and $20.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. In 2011, we recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $401.4 million, of which $316.4 million primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions and $85.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $674.0 million in 2012, compared with expense of $179.0 million in 2011. The increase was driven by income of $787.8 million recognized from the early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation by Amylin. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 29Our effective tax rate was 24.4 percent in 2012, compared with 18.7 percent in 2011. The increase in 2012 reflects the tax impact of the payment received from Amylin and the expiration of the research and development tax credit at the end of 2011, partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase. The effective tax rate for 2011 was lower due to a tax benefit on the IPR&D charge associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as a benefit from the resolution in 2011 of the IRS audits of tax years 2005-2007, along with certain matters related to 2008-2009. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Operating Results—2011Financial ResultsWe achieved revenue growth of 5 percent to $24.29 billion in 2011, primarily driven by the collective growth of Cymbalta, insulin products, animal health products, Alimta, Effient, and Cialis, partially offset by the decline in Gemzar and Zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity. This revenue growth, as well as a lower effective tax rate, was more than offset by lower gross margin percentage; increased marketing, selling, and administrative costs; higher other expense; and the increased impact in 2011 of the items noted below. As a result, net income decreased 14 percent to $4.35 billion, and EPS decreased 15 percent to $3.90 per share, in 2011 as compared to $5.07 billion, or $4.58 per share, in 2010. In addition to the highlighted items summarized in the ""Executive Overview,"" 2011 results also included the following items that affect comparisons:U.S. Health Care Reform•As a result of higher rebates and subsidies included in health care reform enacted in the U.S. during 2010, total revenue in 2011 was reduced by $408.8 million (pretax), or $0.29 per share. Also, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased by $178.0 million (pretax), or $0.16 per share, as a result of the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers’ fee.The 2010 highlighted items are summarized as follows:U.S. Health Care Reform•As a result of higher rebates included in health care reform enacted in the U.S. during 2010, total revenue in 2010 was reduced by $229.0 million (pretax), or $0.16 per share. We also recorded a one-time non-cash deferred income tax charge of $85.1 million, or $0.08 per share, associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our U.S. retiree health plan.Acquisitions (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We incurred acquired IPR&D charges associated with the in-licensing arrangement with Acrux Limited (Acrux) of $50.0 million (pretax), which decreased EPS by $0.03.Asset Impairments, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $192.0 million (pretax), or $0.13 per share, primarily related to severance costs. RevenueOur worldwide revenue for 2011 increased 5 percent, to $24.29 billion, driven by the collective growth of Cymbalta, insulin products, animal health products, Alimta, Effient, and Cialis, partially offset by the decline in Gemzar and Zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity. Worldwide sales volume increased 6 percent, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue growth, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease due to lower prices. The increase in volume and reduction in price were partially driven by the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Zyprexa and Gemzar and the agreements to supply authorized versions of olanzapine and gemcitabine. Revenue in the U.S. increased 1 percent, to $12.98 billion, due to higher volume, partially offset by lower prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $11.31 billion, due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Total revenue was reduced by $408.8 million in 2011 due to the impact of U.S. health care reform, compared to a reduction of $229.0 million in 2010.30The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2011 compared with 2010: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 PercentChange from ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total2010 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa$2,165.3 $2,456.7 $4,622.0 $5,026.4 (8)Cymbalta3,173.4 988.4 4,161.8 3,459.2 20Alimta994.6 1,466.5 2,461.1 2,208.6 11Humalog1,398.9 968.7 2,367.6 2,054.2 15Cialis704.5 1,171.1 1,875.6 1,699.4 10Humulin588.1 660.7 1,248.8 1,088.9 15Evista707.5 359.4 1,066.9 1,024.4 4Forteo453.1 496.7 949.8 830.1 14Strattera392.2 227.9 620.1 576.7 8Gemzar70.6 381.5 452.1 1,149.4 (61)Other pharmaceutical products879.4 1,221.0 2,100.4 1,933.5 9Animal health products896.8 781.8 1,678.6 1,391.4 21Total net product sales12,424.4 11,180.4 23,604.8 22,442.2 5Collaboration and other revenue(2)552.8 128.9 681.7 633.8 8Total revenue$12,977.2 $11,309.3 $24,286.5 $23,076.0 51 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.2 Collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of royalties for Erbitux and revenue associated with exenatide in the United States.Sales of Zyprexa decreased 13 percent in the U.S., due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. on October 23, 2011. Despite a decline in demand for branded Zyprexa, U.S. volume increased in 2011 primarily as a result of sales of authorized olanzapine in connection with our six-month agreement with Prasco Laboratories. This volume increase was more than offset by significant price reductions attributable both to branded Zyprexa and authorized olanzapine. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent, driven primarily by the loss of patent exclusivity throughout most major markets outside of Japan during 2011, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in Japan.Sales of Cymbalta increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 44 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Alimta increased 4 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 17 percent, due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Humalog increased 14 percent in the U.S., due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Cialis increased 7 percent in the U.S., primarily due to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by increased demand, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher prices.Sales of Humulin increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices for Humulin and increased demand attributable to Humulin ReliOn. Sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, due to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices.31Sales of Evista increased 4 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices, partially offset by decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 5 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Forteo decreased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, primarily due to increased demand in Japan.Sales of Strattera increased 1 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 22 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices.Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to treat various cancers, decreased 90 percent in the U.S., due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition, which began in November 2010, following the expiration of the compound patent. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 10 percent, due to generic competition in most major markets.Prior to the termination of our exenatide collaboration with Amylin in November 2011, we recognized in revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta's gross margin in the United States. In December 2011, we recognized a pro rata portion of revenue resulting from the termination agreement. In 2011, we recognized total exenatide revenue of $422.7 million, a decrease of 2 percent.Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 16 percent, due primarily to increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 27 percent, driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain Janssen and Pfizer animal health assets in Europe and, to a lesser extent, increased demand for other products and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 2.0 percentage points in 2011 to 79.1 percent. This decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which significantly increased cost of sales in 2011, but led to a modest reduction to cost of sales in 2010. Patent expirations for Zyprexa and Gemzar also drove the reduction in gross margin percent.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2011 to $7.88 billion. The increase was driven by the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates. In addition, higher administrative expenses in the U.S. included $178.0 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers' fee associated with U.S. health care reform. Investment in research and development increased 3 percent, to $5.02 billion, due primarily to increased late-stage clinical trial costs, including costs related to the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim.We incurred an IPR&D charge of $388.0 million in 2011, associated with our diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, compared with $50.0 million in 2010 associated with the in-licensing agreement with Acrux. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $401.4 million in 2011, including charges of $316.4 million primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, and a special charge of $85.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. In 2010, we recognized charges totaling $192.0 million for asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges. See Notes 3 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, expense increased $174.0 million to an expense of $179.0 million in 2011, due primarily to impairments of acquired IPR&D assets in 2011 and damages recovered in 2010 from generic pharmaceutical companies related to Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Our effective tax rate was 18.7 percent in 2011, compared with 22.3 percent in 2010. The decrease was due to the tax benefit on the IPR&D charge associated with the Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes collaboration, as well as a benefit from the resolution in 2011 of the IRS audits of tax years 2005-2007, along with certain matters related to 2008-2009. Additionally, the tax rate for 2010 was increased by a one-time charge associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our retiree health plan as part of U.S. health care reform. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.32FINANCIAL CONDITIONAs of December 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.02 billion compared with $5.92 billion at December 31, 2011. The decrease was driven by net purchases of $3.26 billion in investment securities with maturities extending beyond one year, dividends paid of $2.19 billion, the maturity and repayment of long-term debt of $1.50 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $905.4 million, and common stock repurchases of $721.1 million, partially offset by cash from operations of $5.30 billion, and $1.38 billion in proceeds from the early payment of Amylin's revenue-sharing obligations and loan.Capital expenditures of $905.4 million during 2012 were $233.4 million more than in 2011. We expect 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately $900 million as we invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes-care product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality, productivity, and capability of our manufacturing, research, and development facilities.As of December 31, 2012, total debt was $5.53 billion, a decrease of $1.46 billion compared with $6.99 billion at December 31, 2011. The decrease is due primarily to the previously mentioned long-term debt maturity and payment of $1.50 billion. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s remain AA- and A2, respectively. Our ratings outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s is stable.Dividends of $1.96 per share were paid in 2012 and 2011. 2012 was the 128th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments. In the fourth quarter of 2012, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2013, the quarterly dividend was maintained at $0.49 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2013 of $1.96 per share.Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation; the federal government's involvement in the U.S. economy; and various international government funding levels. We continue to focus specifically on the economic health of the European economy, as heightened economic concerns persist. Currently, we believe economic conditions in Europe will not have a material impact on our liquidity.We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and contractual maturities due on debt in 2013. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowings. We currently have $1.36 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations.We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. Through 2014, we expect to lose U.S. patent protection for Cymbalta (December 2013) and Evista (March 2014). The loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista will likely result in generic competition, generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product, and having a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The U.S. patent for Humalog expires in May 2013. Humalog is currently protected in Europe only by formulation patents. We do not currently expect the loss of patent protection for Humalog to result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. To date, no biosimilar version of Humalog has been approved in the U.S. or Europe; however, we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop biosimilar forms of Humalog, and it is difficult to predict the likelihood, timing, and impact of biosimilars entering the market. Our goal is to mitigate the effect of these exclusivity losses on our operations, liquidity, and financial position through growth in our patent-protected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period, in the emerging markets, in Japan, and in our animal health business. Our expected growth in the emerging markets and Japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of patent-protected products.In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.33Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2012 and 2011, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen). Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.34Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 YearsLong-term debt, including interest payments(1)$7,425.6 $156.5 $1,277.5 $1,474.0 $4,517.6Capital lease obligations42.0 14.9 22.3 4.8 —Operating leases647.3 145.3 231.6 134.0 136.4Purchase obligations(2)13,629.5 12,158.5 674.9 460.0 336.1Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(3)1,796.9 — 537.2 262.6 997.1Other(4)371.3 371.3 — — —Total$23,912.6 $12,846.5 $2,743.5 $2,335.4 $5,987.21 Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2012, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.2 We have included the following:•Purchase obligations consist primarily of all open purchase orders as of December 31, 2012. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.•Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.3 We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $1.33 billion, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.4 This category consists of various miscellaneous items expected to be paid in the next year, none of which are individually material. We excluded unfunded commitments of $75.4 million, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those commitments.The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2012. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded.We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a 35consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.When sales occur, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have been less than 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales.We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries), an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves.We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. A 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability at December 31, 2012 would lead to an approximate $108 million effect on our income before income taxes. 36The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was 83 percent and 82 percent as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2012 2011Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$1,597.9 $1,155.3Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates(1) 3,563.5 4,016.9Cash payments of discounts and rebates(3,576.9) (3,574.3)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$1,584.5 $1,597.91 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1.0 percent of net sales for each of the years presented.Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we have been and will continue to be largely self-insured for product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims.The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.Pension and Retiree Medical Plan AssumptionsPension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected rate of return, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 80 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2012 annual expense would increase by $15.6 million. A one-37percentage-point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2012 service cost and interest cost by $12.6 million. If the 2012 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $35.2 million. If the 2012 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $19.7 million. If our assumption regarding the 2012 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $43.6 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 80 percent of the total projected benefit obligation and approximately 81 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2012.Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization, to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each project independently.For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in the “Late-Stage Pipeline” section. The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.The estimated future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates.Income TaxesWe prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed 38any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.As of December 31, 2012, a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $46.4 million and $33.8 million, respectively.LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2013 Our 2013 financial guidance includes an estimated one-time benefit of $0.07 per share associated with the research and development tax credit for 2012 that will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013, resulting from the delay in the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. For the full year of 2013, we expect EPS to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $22.6 billion and $23.4 billion. Despite the initial impact of the U.S. Cymbalta patent expiration in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the loss of the anticipated 15 percent revenue-sharing obligation on worldwide exenatide sales, we expect overall revenue growth, driven by a portfolio of products including Humalog, Humulin, Cialis, Strattera, Forteo, Alimta, Cymbalta outside the U.S., Effient, Tradjenta, and Axiron, as well as animal health products. In addition, significant revenue growth is expected in Japan and the emerging markets, particularly China.We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 78 percent. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.4 billion. Research and development expense is expected to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be in a range between $340 million and $490 million of income. Operating cash flows are expected to be more than sufficient to pay our dividend, complete our previously announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program, allow for capital expenditures of approximately $900 million, and fund potential business development activity.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) in Item 7 at “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.39",2023-12-30 16:23:17.302980
59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2014,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionRESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewThis section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data is presented on a diluted basis.Financial ResultsWorldwide total revenue increased 2 percent to $23.11 billion in 2013, driven by growth in several products, including Cialis®, Humalog®, Trajenta®, Alimta®, Forteo®, and animal health products, partially offset by the continued erosion of Zyprexa® sales following the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. and most major markets outside Japan. In 2013, net income increased 15 percent to $4.68 billion and EPS increased 18 percent to $4.32, compared to 2012 net income and EPS of $4.09 billion and $3.66, respectively. The increases were due to higher gross margin, lower marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, and, to a lesser extent, a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher research and development expenses and lower other income. EPS in 2013 also benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding compared to 2012 as a result of our share repurchase programs. The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2013 and 2012 financial results:2013Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $495.4 million (pretax), or $0.29 per share, related to the transfer to Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) of exenatide commercial rights in all markets outside the United States.Acquired In-Process Research & Development (IPR&D) (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $57.1 million (pretax), or $0.03 per share, resulting from our acquisition of all development and commercial rights for a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody currently being studied as a potential treatment for the prevention of frequent, recurrent migraine headaches, following a successful Phase II proof-of-concept study. Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $120.6 million (pretax), or $0.08 per share, primarily related to severance costs for actions taken to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, as well as other costs associated with the anticipated closure of a packaging and distribution facility in Germany.2012 Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $787.8 million (pretax), or $0.43 per share, related to the early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation following the completion of Amylin's acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $281.1 million (pretax), or $0.16 per share, consisting of an intangible asset impairment related to liprotamase, restructuring charges related to initiatives to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, charges associated with the decision to stop development of a delivery device platform, and charges related to changes in returns reserve estimates for the withdrawal of Xigris™.27Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have approximately 60 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in preclinical research.The following new molecular entities (NMEs) have been submitted for regulatory review for potential use in the disease described. The quarter the NME initially was submitted for any indication is shown in parentheses:Dulaglutide* (Q3 2013)—a long-acting analog of glucagon-like peptide 1 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Empagliflozin (Q1 2013)—a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim). New insulin glargine product (Q2 2013)—a new insulin glargine product for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim). Ramucirumab* (Q3 2013)—an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) monoclonal antibody submitted for regulatory review as a single agent for the treatment of gastric cancer. We intend to submit an application for ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of gastric cancer to regulatory authorities in 2014. We also intend to submit our first application for ramucirumab in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel) in patients with second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to regulatory authorities in 2014. In addition, we are currently studying ramucirumab in Phase III studies for the treatment of liver cancer and colorectal cancer.The following NMEs are currently in Phase III clinical trial testing for potential use in the diseases described. The quarter in which the NME initially entered Phase III for any indication is shown in parentheses:Baricitinib (Q4 2012)—a Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK 1 and JAK 2) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (in collaboration with Incyte Corporation).Basal insulin peglispro (formerly known as novel basal insulin analog)* (Q4 2011)—a novel basal insulin for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Evacetrapib (Q4 2012)—a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor for the treatment of high-risk vascular disease.Ixekizumab* (Q4 2011)—a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to interleukin-17A (IL-17) for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.Necitumumab* (Q4 2009)—an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of squamous NSCLC.Solanezumab* (Q2 2009)—an anti-amyloid beta (Aß) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of mild Alzheimer’s disease.Tabalumab* (Q4 2010)—an anti-B-cell activating factor (BAFF) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus).Tanezumab* (Q3 2008)—an anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain, chronic low back pain and cancer pain (in collaboration with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer)). Tanezumab is currently subject to a partial clinical hold by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).*Biologic molecule subject to the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation ActThe following are late-stage pipeline updates since January 1, 2013:Basal insulin peglispro—In January 2013, we announced plans for the 2013 and 2014 initiation of the remainder of the pre-planned clinical trials for the molecule. These studies will be conducted to support regulatory submissions and evaluate safety, efficacy, and differentiation of the molecule. These studies are in addition to the five ongoing IMAGINE clinical trials.28Dulaglutide—In April 2013, we announced that the Phase III AWARD-2 and AWARD-4 trials studying dulaglutide as an investigational once-weekly treatment for type 2 diabetes met the primary endpoints related to reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to insulin glargine, and that the 1.5 mg dose demonstrated statistically superior reduction in HbA1c from baseline compared to insulin glargine in both trials. In the third quarter of 2013, we filed for regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe.Edivoxetine—In December 2013, we announced the decision to stop development of edivoxetine as an add-on treatment for depression due to lack of efficacy in three acute randomized placebo-controlled Phase III studies. The decision was not based on safety concerns.Empagliflozin—In January 2013, we announced positive top-line results for four completed Phase III clinical trials studying empagliflozin for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. In all four studies, the primary efficacy endpoint, defined as significant change in HbA1c from baseline compared to placebo, was met with empagliflozin (10 and 25 mg) taken once daily. The pivotal studies for empagliflozin were completed in 2012. In the first quarter of 2013, Boehringer Ingelheim filed for regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. The Boehringer Ingelheim manufacturing facility where empagliflozin is being produced is subject to an FDA warning letter; however, it is not clear if this will impact the timing of FDA action for empagliflozin. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Boehringer Ingelheim filed for regulatory review in Japan. Enzastaurin—In May 2013, we announced the decision to stop development of enzastaurin as a result of negative clinical trial results from the Phase III PRELUDE study, which explored the molecule as a monotherapy in the prevention of relapse for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Ixekizumab—In January 2013, we initiated Phase III clinical trial testing for ixekizumab as a potential treatment for psoriatic arthritis.Liprotamase—In December 2013, we made the decision to discontinue further development of liprotamase. Necitumumab—In August 2013, we announced that the Phase III study, SQUIRE, met its primary endpoint, finding that patients with stage IV metastatic squamous NSCLC experienced increased overall survival when administered necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as a first-line treatment, as compared to chemotherapy alone. We anticipate filing for regulatory review before the end of 2014. New insulin glargine product—In July 2013, we and Boehringer Ingelheim announced that the marketing authorization application for our new insulin glargine product, filed in June 2013 through the biosimilar pathway, was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we filed for regulatory review in the U.S. and Japan. In January 2014, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (Sanofi) filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging patent infringement with respect to our insulin glargine product for which we are seeking approval from the FDA. Sanofi asserts infringement of two patents relating to pen injector devices and two patents relating to insulin glargine formulations. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the initiation of the lawsuit automatically invokes a stay of FDA approval of the product for a period of 30 months, which may be shortened in the event of an earlier decision in our favor. We believe the lawsuit is without merit, and we are prepared to vigorously defend against the allegations.Ramucirumab—Our rolling submission to the FDA for ramucirumab as a single-agent biologic therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer following progression on prior chemotherapy was completed in the third quarter of 2013, and received Priority Review status by the FDA in October 2013. Our regulatory submission in Europe for the same indication was also completed in the third quarter of 2013. In September 2013, we announced that the RAINBOW trial, a global Phase III study of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer, met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and a secondary endpoint of improved progression-free survival. We intend to submit an application for this indication to regulatory authorities in 2014. In September 2013, we also announced that a separate global Phase III study of ramucirumab in women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, ROSE, did not meet its primary endpoint of 29progression-free survival. We do not plan to submit an application to regulatory authorities for ramucirumab in the first-line treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer based on the results from the ROSE study. In February 2014, we announced that the REVEL trial, a global Phase III study of ramucirumab in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel) in patients with second-line NSCLC, met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival and a secondary endpoint of improved progression-free survival. We intend to submit the first application for this indication to regulatory authorities in 2014. Tabalumab—In February 2013, we announced our decision to discontinue the Phase III rheumatoid arthritis program for tabalumab due to lack of efficacy. The decision was not based on safety concerns. The tabalumab Phase III program for lupus is continuing as planned.Tanezumab—In October 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to jointly develop and globally commercialize tanezumab for the potential treatment of osteoarthritis pain, chronic low back pain, and cancer pain. Tanezumab is currently in Phase III clinical development and is subject to a partial clinical hold by the FDA pending submission of nonclinical data to the FDA. Pfizer anticipates submitting that data in 2014. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) and the introduction of new products. A high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development. The process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than $1 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success. Delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the U.S. and other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products.We manage R&D spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total R&D spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the R&D process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our R&D projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful R&D project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated R&D expense. While we do accumulate certain R&D costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total R&D costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.Legal, Regulatory, and Other MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. Cymbalta® lost patent exclusivity in the U.S. in December 2013, resulting in the immediate entry of several generic competitors. We also expect the loss of U.S. patent protection for Evista® in March 2014 to result in immediate generic competition. We will lose our data package protection for Cymbalta in major European countries in 2014; however, we do not anticipate the entry of generic competition in most of these countries until 2015. The entry of generic competition in each of these markets is expected to cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected products, having a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. compound patent for Humalog expired in May 2013. The loss of compound patent protection for Humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. To date, no biosimilar version of Humalog has been approved in the U.S. or Europe; however, we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop biosimilar forms of Humalog, and it is difficult to predict the likelihood, timing, and impact of biosimilars entering the market. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies’ revenue 30or increase expenses may be enacted. Certain federal and state health care proposals, including state price controls, continue to be debated, and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices. These federal and state proposals, or state price pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Proposals for cost-containment measures are pending in a number of countries, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls, limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the value of our intellectual-property protection. Such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of continued austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries; the desire to manage health expenses carefully even as economies recover; and the effort in some countries to expand access to health care coverage while seeking savings from the biopharmaceutical sector.The Obama administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S.-based companies. There also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change the manner in which, and the rate at which, income of U.S. companies would be taxed. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, will continue to be a topic of discussion for Congress and the Obama administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recently launched an initiative to analyze and potentially influence international tax policy in the major countries in which we operate. While the outcomes of this initiative are uncertain, significant changes to key elements of the global international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.Operating Results—2013 RevenueOur worldwide revenue for 2013 increased 2 percent, to $23.11 billion, compared with 2012 as an increase of 5 percent due to higher prices was partially offset by a decrease of 2 percent due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 1 percent decrease due to lower volume. Total revenue in the U.S. increased 5 percent, to $12.89 billion, due to higher prices, partially offset by volume declines for Cymbalta and Zyprexa due to the loss of patent exclusivity. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, to $10.22 billion, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the continued weakness of the Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by increased volume.31The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2013 compared with 2012: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 PercentChange from ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total2012 (Dollars in millions) Cymbalta$3,960.8 $1,123.6 $5,084.4 $4,994.1 2Alimta1,209.1 1,493.9 2,703.0 2,594.3 4Humalog1,521.4 1,089.8 2,611.2 2,395.5 9Cialis942.8 1,216.6 2,159.4 1,926.8 12Humulin®677.2 638.6 1,315.8 1,239.1 6Forteo511.4 733.5 1,244.9 1,151.0 8Zyprexa123.6 1,071.2 1,194.8 1,701.4 (30)Evista772.0 278.4 1,050.4 1,010.1 4Strattera®446.3 262.9 709.2 621.4 14Effient®376.9 131.8 508.7 457.2 11Other pharmaceutical products639.5 1,032.8 1,672.3 1,843.0 (9)Animal health products1,226.6 924.9 2,151.5 2,036.5 6Total net product sales12,407.6 9,998.0 22,405.6 21,970.4 2Collaboration and other revenue(2)482.1 225.4 707.5 633.0 12Total revenue$12,889.7 $10,223.4 $23,113.1 $22,603.4 21U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.2Collaboration and other revenue in 2013 consists primarily of royalties for Erbitux® and revenue associated with Trajenta. Collaboration and other revenue in 2012 also includes revenue associated with exenatide in the United States. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia, increased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, largely offset by lower demand due to the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013, which is causing rapid and severe declines in our Cymbalta sales. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven primarily by increased volume, partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. We will lose effective exclusivity for Cymbalta in major European countries upon expiration of our data package protection in 2014; however, because generic manufacturers cannot file for regulatory approval until after our data package protection expires, we do not anticipate the entry of generic competition in most of these countries until 2015. While it is difficult to predict the precise impact on Cymbalta sales, we expect the introduction of generics in these markets to result in a rapid and severe decline in our Cymbalta sales, which will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 8 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices.Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 11 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, wholesaler buying patterns, and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), increased 21 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by higher prices and increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume.32Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, increased 5 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, due to increased volume, primarily in Japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance, decreased 66 percent in the U.S. due to the continued erosion following patent expiration in 2011. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 20 percent, driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates, lower volume in markets outside of Japan, and lower prices. Zyprexa sales in Japan were approximately $510 million in 2013, compared to approximately $585 million in 2012, and were negatively impacted by the continued weakness of the Japanese yen.Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 10 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices, partially offset by increased volume in Japan.We will lose effective patent exclusivity for Evista in the U.S. on March 2, 2014. We expect generic competition immediately following the loss of exclusivity. While it is difficult to predict the precise impact on Evista sales, we expect the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in our U.S. Evista sales, which will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, increased 16 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven primarily by increased volume in Japan, partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Effient, a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention, including patients undergoing angioplasty, atherectomy, or stent placement, increased 11 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven primarily by increased volume. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent driven primarily by increased volume for Trifexis® and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue remained at 78.8 percent in 2013 as higher prices were offset by the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which significantly decreased the cost of sales in 2012.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent to $7.13 billion in 2013, driven primarily by lower selling and marketing expenses resulting from ongoing cost-containment efforts, including the previously announced reduction in U.S. sales and marketing activities in anticipation of the loss of patent exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates.Research and development expenses increased 5 percent to $5.53 billion in 2013, due to higher research and clinical development expenses, including $97.2 million of milestone payments made to Boehringer Ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin.We recognized an acquired IPR&D charge of $57.1 million in 2013 resulting from our acquisition of a CGRP antibody currently being studied as a potential treatment for the prevention of frequent, recurrent migraine headaches, following a successful Phase II proof-of-concept study. There were no acquired IPR&D charges in 2012. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $120.6 million in 2013. These charges included $30.0 million of asset impairments primarily associated with the anticipated closure of a packaging and distribution facility in Germany, and $90.6 million of severance costs to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. In 2012, we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $281.1 million. These charges included $122.6 million related to an intangible asset impairment for 33liprotamase, $74.5 million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, $64.0 million related to the asset impairment of a delivery device platform, and $20.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $518.9 million in 2013, compared with income of $674.0 million in 2012. The decrease was driven primarily by lower income related to the termination of the exenatide collaboration with Amylin of $495.4 million in 2013 compared with $787.8 million in 2012, partially offset by milestone payments received from Boehringer Ingelheim for regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. See Notes 4 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our effective tax rate was 20.5 percent in 2013, compared with 24.4 percent in 2012. The 2012 effective tax rate reflected the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011 and the tax impact of the payment received from Amylin, partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase. The decrease in the 2013 effective tax rate reflects the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. effective January 1, 2013 as well as the one-time impact of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2012 that was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Operating Results—2012Financial ResultsWorldwide total revenue decreased 7 percent to $22.60 billion in 2012, driven by steep sales declines for Zyprexa due to the loss of patent exclusivity in most major markets, partially offset by growth in certain other products. Net income and EPS decreased 6 percent to $4.09 billion and $3.66, respectively, in 2012 compared with net income of $4.35 billion and EPS of $3.90 in 2011. The decreases in net income and EPS were due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa, partially offset by growth in certain other products and higher other income from the early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation from Amylin. The 2012 highlighted items are summarized in the ""Executive Overview"" section. The 2011 highlighted items are summarized as follows:Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We incurred acquired IPR&D charges associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim of $388.0 million (pretax), or $0.23 per share.Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $316.4 million (pretax), or $0.24 per share, primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions to reduce our cost structure and global workforce.•We incurred a charge of $85.0 million (pretax), or $0.05 per share, primarily for returned product and contractual commitments related to the withdrawal of Xigris.RevenueOur worldwide revenue for 2012 decreased 7 percent, to $22.60 billion, driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets, partially offset by growth in Cymbalta, Forteo, Effient, Alimta, and our animal health portfolio. Worldwide sales volume decreased 7 percent and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue decline, partially offset by an increase of 2 percent due to higher prices. The decrease in volume was driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets, partially offset by volume gains for certain other products. Total revenue in the U.S. decreased 5 percent, to $12.31 billion, due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa, partially offset by higher prices and increased demand for certain other products. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 9 percent, to $10.29 billion, driven by the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in markets outside of Japan, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates, and lower prices, partially offset by increased demand for certain other products.34The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2012 compared with 2011: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 PercentChange from ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total2011 (Dollars in millions) Cymbalta$3,917.8 $1,076.3 $4,994.1 $4,161.8 20Alimta1,122.4 1,471.9 2,594.3 2,461.1 5Humalog1,370.9 1,024.6 2,395.5 2,367.6 1Cialis782.2 1,144.6 1,926.8 1,875.6 3Zyprexa360.4 1,341.0 1,701.4 4,622.0 (63)Humulin592.1 647.0 1,239.1 1,248.8 (1)Forteo488.2 662.8 1,151.0 949.8 21Evista699.5 310.6 1,010.1 1,066.9 (5)Strattera384.1 237.3 621.4 620.1 —Effient339.0 118.2 457.2 302.5 51Other pharmaceutical products593.4 1,249.6 1,843.0 2,250.0 (18)Animal health products1,161.8 874.7 2,036.5 1,678.6 21Total net product sales11,811.8 10,158.6 21,970.4 23,604.8 (7)Collaboration and other revenue(2)501.3 131.7 633.0 681.7 (7)Total revenue$12,313.1 $10,290.3 $22,603.4 $24,286.5 (7)1U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.2Collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of royalties for Erbitux and revenue associated with exenatide in the United States.Sales of Cymbalta increased 23 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices and, to a lesser extent, increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 9 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Alimta increased 13 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. remained flat, as increased demand was offset by lower prices in Japan and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Humalog decreased 2 percent in the U.S., due to increased government and commercial rebates as well as the product's removal from a large formulary in 2012. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, due to increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Cialis increased 11 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased demand and higher prices.Sales of Zyprexa decreased 83 percent in the United States. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 45 percent. The decreases were due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. and most major international markets outside of Japan, partially offset by growth in Japan. Zyprexa sales in Japan were approximately $585 million in 2012, compared to approximately $540 million in 2011.Sales of Humulin increased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, largely offset by decreased demand. U.S. sales of Humulin were negatively affected by the product's removal from a large formulary in 2012, as well as the continued decline in the market for human insulin and the termination of the Humulin ReliOn agreement with Walmart. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume.Sales of Forteo increased 8 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Sales outside the U.S. increased 33 percent, primarily due to the increased demand in Japan.35Sales of Evista decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, largely offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 14 percent, driven by decreased volume and, to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Strattera decreased 2 percent in the U.S., due to decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased demand in Japan, partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Effient increased 52 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 47 percent, due to increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 30 percent, primarily due to increased demand for companion animal products. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain Janssen animal health assets in Europe (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), and the growth of other products, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 0.3 percentage points in 2012 to 78.8 percent. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales of Zyprexa and, to a lesser extent, higher miscellaneous manufacturing costs, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which decreased cost of sales in 2012 and increased cost of sales in 2011.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent in 2012 to $7.51 billion, driven by lower marketing expense resulting from our cost-containment efforts. Research and development expenses increased 5 percent to $5.28 billion, due to higher late-stage clinical trial costs.No acquired IPR&D charges were incurred in 2012, compared with $388.0 million in 2011, all of which was associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $281.1 million in 2012. These charges comprised $122.6 million related to an intangible asset impairment for liprotamase, $74.5 million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, $64.0 million related to the asset impairment of a delivery device platform, and $20.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. In 2011, we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $401.4 million, of which $316.4 million primarily related to severance costs from strategic actions and $85.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $674.0 million in 2012, compared with expense of $179.0 million in 2011. The increase was driven by income of $787.8 million recognized from the early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation by Amylin. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our effective tax rate was 24.4 percent in 2012, compared with 18.7 percent in 2011. The increase in 2012 reflects the tax impact of the payment received from Amylin and the expiration of the research and development tax credit at the end of 2011, partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase. The effective tax rate for 2011 was lower due to a tax benefit on the IPR&D charge associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as a benefit from the resolution in 2011 of the IRS audits of tax years 2005-2007, along with certain matters related to 2008-2009. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.FINANCIAL CONDITIONAs of December 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents decreased to $3.83 billion compared with $4.02 billion at December 31, 2012, as cash flow from operations of $5.74 billion was more than offset by dividends paid of $2.12 billion, share repurchases of $1.70 billion, net purchases of investments of $1.02 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $1.01 billion. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $9.19 billion and $7.98 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. 36As of December 31, 2013, total debt was $5.21 billion, a decrease of $318.4 million compared with $5.53 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease is due primarily to the decrease in fair value of our hedged debt. We intend to refinance $1.00 billion of debt that is maturing in March 2014. A portion of the interest rate risk associated with the anticipated refinancing has been hedged through the use of forward-starting interest rate swaps. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We currently have $1.36 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Capital expenditures of $1.01 billion during 2013 were $106.7 million more than in 2012. We expect 2014 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion as we invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes-care product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality, productivity, and capability of our manufacturing, research, and development facilities.For the 129th consecutive year, we distributed dividend payments to our shareholders. Dividends of $1.96 per share were paid in both 2013 and 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2013, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2014, the quarterly dividend was maintained at $0.49 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2014 of $1.96 per share.During 2013, we repurchased the remaining $1.10 billion of shares associated with our $1.50 billion share repurchase program announced in 2012. In October 2013, we announced a new $5.00 billion share repurchase program which will be completed over time. We purchased $500.0 million of shares under the new repurchase program in 2013.At December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate of $11.61 billion of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries. A significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the United States. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., no accrual for U.S. income taxes is provided. We believe cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs, dividends paid to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. In December 2013, we lost U.S. patent protection for Cymbalta. In 2014, we will lose U.S. patent protection for Evista and data package protection for Cymbalta in major European countries. See ""Executive Overview—Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters"" for additional information. Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation; and various international government funding levels. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2013 and 2012, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from 37translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen). Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. See Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4, Collaborations,"" for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.38Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 YearsLong-term debt, including interest payments(1)$7,589.0 $1,136.3 $495.3 $1,473.0 $4,484.4Capital lease obligations27.3 10.3 13.8 3.2 —Operating leases620.0 136.5 218.4 147.2 117.9Purchase obligations(2)13,199.5 12,310.1 455.8 279.0 154.6Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(3)1,989.2 — 861.5 260.5 867.2Other(4)476.9 476.9 — — —Total$23,901.9 $14,070.1 $2,044.8 $2,162.9 $5,624.11Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2013, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.2We have included the following:•Purchase obligations consist primarily of all open purchase orders as of December 31, 2013. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.•Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.3We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $1.08 billion, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.4This category consists of various miscellaneous items expected to be paid in the next year, none of which are individually material. We excluded unfunded commitments of $142.2 million, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those commitments.The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2013. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded.We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major 39wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.When sales occur, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (generally, 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, among others, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Additional adjustments to the returns reserve may be required in the future based on revised estimates to our assumptions, which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have been less than 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of sales. However, we expect the ratio of actual product returns as a percentage of net sales to increase in future periods as we begin to experience elevated return levels for both Zyprexa and Cymbalta following the recent losses of patent exclusivity for these products in several major markets.We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries), an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves.We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. A 5 percent change in our global 40sales return, rebate, and discount liability at December 31, 2013 would lead to an approximate $138 million effect on our income before income taxes. The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was 88 percent and 83 percent as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2013 2012Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$1,584.5 $1,597.9Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates(1) 4,723.3 3,563.5Cash payments of discounts and rebates(4,092.3) (3,576.9)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year (2)$2,215.5 $1,584.51 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1.0 percent of net sales for each of the years presented.2 The increase in our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances as of December 31, 2013, as compared to December 31, 2012, is primarily due to an increase in our returns reserve for sales of Cymbalta, which lost U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.Pension and Retiree Medical Plan AssumptionsPension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected rate of return, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 80 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.41If the health-care-cost trend rates were to increase by one percentage point, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2013 annual expense would increase by $9.4 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2013 service cost and interest cost by $7.6 million. If the 2013 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $40.6 million. If the 2013 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $20.1 million. If our assumption regarding the 2013 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $57.6 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 80 percent of both the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at December 31, 2013.Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each project independently.For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in the “Late-Stage Pipeline” section. The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates.Income TaxesWe prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In 42evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.As of December 31, 2013, a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $26.2 million and $32.4 million, respectively.LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2014 For the full year of 2014, we expect EPS to be in the range of $2.77 to $2.85. EPS expectations for 2014 reflect completed share repurchases in 2013 and potential share repurchases in 2014. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $19.2 billion and $19.8 billion. Patent expirations are expected to drive a rapid and severe decline in U.S. sales of Cymbalta and Evista. These revenue declines are expected to be partially offset by growth from a portfolio of other products including Humalog, Trajenta, Cialis, Forteo and Alimta, as well as our animal health business. In addition, strong revenue growth is expected in China, while a weaker Japanese yen is expected to dampen revenue growth in Japan. We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 74 percent in 2014. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Research and development expense is expected to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be in a range between $100 million and $200 million of income, benefited by gains of $150 million to $200 million on the sale of equity investments acquired as part of past business development transactions. Operating cash flows are expected to be sufficient to pay our dividend of approximately $2.1 billion, allow for capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion, and fund potential business development activity and share repurchases.Our 2014 financial guidance does not include a potential charge related to the collaboration with Pfizer to develop and commercialize tanezumab. If the partial clinical hold for the molecule is removed and we and Pfizer move forward with development, we will pay a $200 million upfront fee to Pfizer. This charge would reduce EPS by approximately $0.12.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) in Item 7 at “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.43",2023-12-30 16:23:14.227046
59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2015,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionRESULTS OF OPERATIONSExecutive OverviewThis section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data are presented on a diluted basis.Financial ResultsWorldwide total revenue decreased 15 percent to $19.62 billion in 2014, primarily as a result of the loss of United States (U.S.) patent exclusivity for Cymbalta® in December 2013 and to a lesser extent Evista® in March 2014, partially offset by volume growth in several other products. In 2014, net income decreased 49 percent to $2.39 billion and EPS decreased 48 percent to $2.23, compared to 2013 net income and EPS of $4.68 billion and $4.32, respectively. The decreases were due to lower gross margin, higher asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges and decreased other income, partially offset by lower marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, and income tax expense.The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2014 and 2013 financial results:2014Acquired In-Process Research & Development (IPR&D) (Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $200.2 million (pretax), or $0.12 per share, related to acquired IPR&D from collaboration agreements with Adocia, AstraZeneca UK Limited, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Immunocore Limited.Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $92.0 million (pretax), or $0.06 per share, related to the transfer of our linagliptin and empagliflozin commercial rights in certain countries to Boehringer Ingelheim.Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $468.7 million (pretax), or $0.38 per share, related to severance costs associated with our ongoing cost containment efforts to reduce our cost structure and global workforce and asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico.Other•We recognized a marketing, selling, and administrative expense of $119.0 million (non-tax deductible), or $0.11 per share, for an extra year of the U.S. Branded Prescription Drug Fee (U.S. Drug Fee) due to final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which required us to accelerate into 2014 the recording of an expense for the 2015 fee.302013 Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $57.1 million (pretax), or $0.03 per share, resulting from our acquisition of rights for a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody currently being studied as a potential treatment for the prevention of frequent, recurrent migraine headaches, following a successful Phase II proof-of-concept study. Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $495.4 million (pretax), or $0.29 per share, related to the transfer to Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) of exenatide commercial rights in all markets outside the United States.Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $120.6 million (pretax), or $0.08 per share, primarily related to severance costs for actions taken to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, as well as asset impairment costs associated with the closure of a packaging and distribution facility in Germany.Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have approximately 55 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in preclinical research.The following new molecular entities (NMEs) have been approved by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, or Japan for use in the disease described.

Anticipate FDA action in late 2015.There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) and the introduction of new products. A high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development. The process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than $1 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success. Delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the U.S. and in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved.We manage R&D spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total R&D spending. Due to the risks and 34uncertainties involved in the R&D process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our R&D projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful R&D project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated R&D expense. While we do accumulate certain R&D costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total R&D costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.Other MattersSubsequent Event - Novartis Animal Health AcquisitionOn January 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Novartis Animal Health (Novartis AH) in an all-cash transaction for approximately $5.4 billion. Novartis AH operates in approximately 40 countries. We acquired Novartis AH’s nine manufacturing sites, six dedicated research and development facilities, a global commercial infrastructure with a portfolio of approximately 600 products, a pipeline with more than 40 projects in development, and more than 3,000 employees. The combined organization is expected to increase our animal health product portfolio, expand our global commercial presence, and augment our animal health manufacturing and research and development. In particular, it is expected to provide Elanco with a greater commercial presence in the companion animal and swine markets, expand Elanco’s presence in equine and vaccines areas, and create an entry into the aquaculture market. As a condition to the clearance of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act, following the closing of the acquisition of Novartis AH, we divested certain companion animal assets in the U.S. related to the Sentinel® canine parasiticide franchise to Virbac Corporation for approximately $410 million. The Novartis AH business we retained generated revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in 2014.Patent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. The loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Cymbalta in December 2013 and Evista in March 2014, resulted in the immediate entry of generic competitors and a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected products, having a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We lost our data package protection for Cymbalta in major European countries in 2014 and we anticipate the entry of generic competition in these countries in 2015. We expect that the entry of generic competition for Cymbalta into the markets where it has lost patent protection would cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We will also lose patent exclusivity in December 2015 for Zyprexa® in Japan.Additionally, as described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Alimta® vitamin dosage regimen patent, which provides us with patent protection for Alimta through June 2021 in Japan and major European countries, and through May 2022 in the U.S., has been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. Our compound patent for Alimta will expire in the U.S. in January 2017, and in major European countries and Japan in December 2015. We expect that the entry of generic competition for Alimta into the markets where it has lost patent protection would cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.The U.S. compound patent for Humalog® expired in May 2013. Thus far, the loss of compound patent protection for Humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. To date, no biosimilar version of Humalog has been approved in the U.S. or Europe; however, we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop biosimilar forms of Humalog, and it is difficult to predict the likelihood, timing, and impact of biosimilars entering the market.35Foreign Currency Exchange RatesAs a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Chinese yuan, and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. While we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. In 2014, we saw significant foreign currency rate fluctuations as the U.S. dollar strengthened compared to other foreign currencies, including the euro and the Japanese yen. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations.Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessUnited StatesPrices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals, congressional investigations into manufacturer’s pricing policies, and the federal budget process continue to drive legislative debate. These policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates or other federal measures may be enacted. As a result, pharmaceutical companies may see either a reduction in revenue or increase in expenses. President Obama’s fiscal year 2016 budget includes a number of key health legislative proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals, including a reduction in biologic data exclusivity, modifications to Medicare Parts B and D, and new language that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in Part D. Savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund health care expenditures, such as the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate, and non-health care expenditures. State and federal health care proposals, including price controls, continue to be debated, and if implemented could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations.In the U.S. private sector, the growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals. It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of the U.S. now participates in some form of managed care. MCO’s have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. MCO’s typically maintain formularies specifying which drugs are covered under their plans. Exclusion of a drug from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their branded products included. Price is becoming an increasingly important factor in MCO formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the MCO has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These downward pricing pressures could negatively impact future consolidated results of operations.In 2014, the main coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took effect through both the launch of state-based exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. An emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly for pharmaceuticals. In addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market, driven in part by changes resulting from the ACA, continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. At the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards quality-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.InternationalInternational operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. Such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. In addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. Given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products.36Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. The U.S. and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. For example, the Obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S.-based companies, including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and other tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the U.S. Congress could change the tax rate and manner in which U.S. companies would be taxed. Additionally, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development launched and continues to advance an initiative to analyze and potentially influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate. While outcomes of these initiatives are uncertain, changes to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a material effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows.Legal MattersInformation regarding contingencies relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.Operating Results—2014 RevenueOur worldwide revenue for 2014 was $19.62 billion, a decline of 15 percent compared with 2013. This decrease was comprised of 13 percent due to volume, 2 percent due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and 1 percent due to lower prices (numbers do not add due to rounding). Total revenue in the U.S. decreased 29 percent, to $9.13 billion, due to lower demand for Cymbalta and Evista following patent expirations, and to a lesser extent, to wholesaler buying patterns. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, to $10.48 billion, due to increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2014 compared with 2013: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 PercentChange from ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total2013 (Dollars in millions) Alimta$1,229.5 $1,562.5 $2,792.0 $2,703.0 3Humalog1,627.6 1,157.6 2,785.2 2,611.2 7Cialis®1,039.9 1,251.1 2,291.0 2,159.4 6Cymbalta420.5 1,194.2 1,614.7 5,084.4 (68)Humulin®713.1 687.0 1,400.1 1,315.8 6Forteo®539.0 783.0 1,322.0 1,244.9 6Zyprexa119.8 917.5 1,037.3 1,194.8 (13)Strattera®452.5 286.0 738.5 709.2 4Effient®394.5 127.7 522.2 508.7 3Evista207.2 212.6 419.8 1,050.4 (60)Other pharmaceutical products647.5 910.3 1,557.8 1,672.3 (7)Animal health products1,274.4 1,072.2 2,346.6 2,151.5 9Total net product sales8,665.5 10,161.7 18,827.2 22,405.6 (16)Collaboration and other revenue(2)468.6 319.8 788.4 707.5 11Total revenue$9,134.1 $10,481.5 $19,615.6 $23,113.1 (15)1U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.2Collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of royalties for Erbitux® and revenue associated with Trajenta®.37Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 2 percent in the U.S., driven by increased volume. Sales outside the U.S. increased 5 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices.Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 7 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower net effective selling prices as a result of payer contracts and greater Medicaid and Medicare utilization, as well as wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by higher prices and increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia, decreased 89 percent in the U.S. due to the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 5 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, increased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, driven by increased volume, primarily in Japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen.Sales of Zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance, decreased 3 percent in the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 14 percent, driven by decreased volume, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, and lower prices. We will lose patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan in December 2015. Zyprexa sales in Japan were approximately $465 million in 2014, compared to approximately $510 million in 2013.Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, increased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Sales outside the U.S. increased 9 percent, driven by increased volume, primarily in Japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen.Sales of Effient, a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention, including patients undergoing angioplasty, atherectomy, or stent placement, increased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent, driven by lower volume. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, decreased 73 percent in the U.S., due to the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity in March 2014. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 24 percent, driven primarily by the expiration of a supply agreement in 2013, and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume in food animal products and higher prices, partially offset by decreased volume in companion animal products due to competitive pressure. Sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased volume in food animal products, due in part to the acquisition of Lohmann SE (Lohmann AH) and, to a lesser extent, higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.38Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 74.9 percent in 2014, a decrease of 3.9 percentage points compared with 2013, driven primarily by lower sales of Cymbalta and Evista following U.S. patent expirations.Research and development expenses decreased 14 percent to $4.73 billion in 2014, driven primarily by lower late-stage clinical development costs. Research and development expenses in 2013 included $97.2 million of milestone payments made to Boehringer Ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 7 percent to $6.62 billion in 2014, driven primarily by the reduction in U.S. sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta and Evista, as well as ongoing cost containment efforts, partially offset by an additional $119.0 million charge in 2014 associated with the U.S. Drug Fee, an annual non-tax deductible fee enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that is imposed on us and others engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs. The final regulations issued by the IRS in 2014, accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year, from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur. This change affected all entities conducting covered activities in 2014 and resulted in the need to expense two years of the U.S. Drug Fee in 2014 to account for the fee imposed and paid in 2014 and the fee that will be imposed and paid in 2015.We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $200.2 million in 2014 resulting from our collaboration agreements with Adocia, AstraZeneca, and Immunocore Limited in addition to charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us, from Boehringer Ingelheim, of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it is not yet approved. There were $57.1 million of acquired IPR&D charges in 2013 related to the acquisition of rights for the CGRP antibody. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $468.7 million in 2014. These charges included $225.5 million of severance costs related to ongoing efforts to reduce our cost structure and global workforce and $243.2 million of asset impairment and other special charges consisting primarily of a $180.8 million asset impairment charge related to our decision to close and sell a manufacturing plant located in Puerto Rico. In 2013, we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $120.6 million. These charges included $30.0 million of asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a packaging and distribution facility in Germany, and $90.6 million of severance costs to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $340.5 million in 2014, compared with income of $518.9 million in 2013. Other income in 2014 included net gains of $216.4 million on investments and $92.0 million of income related to the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to Boehringer Ingelheim. Other income in 2013 was primarily comprised of $495.4 million related to the termination of the exenatide collaboration with Amylin. See Notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Our effective tax rate was 20.3 percent in 2014, compared with 20.5 percent in 2013. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.39Operating Results—2013Financial ResultsWorldwide total revenue increased 2 percent to $23.11 billion in 2013, driven by growth in several products, including Cialis, Humalog, Trajenta, Alimta, Forteo, and animal health products, partially offset by the continued erosion of Zyprexa sales following the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. and most major markets outside Japan. In 2013, net income increased 15 percent to $4.68 billion and EPS increased 18 percent to $4.32, compared to 2012 net income and EPS of $4.09 billion and $3.66, respectively. The increases were due to higher gross margin, lower marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, and, to a lesser extent, a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher research and development expenses and lower other income. EPS in 2013 also benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase programs. The 2013 highlighted items are summarized in the ""Executive Overview"" section. The 2012 highlighted items are summarized as follows:Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $787.8 million (pretax), or $0.43 per share, related to the early payment of the exenatide revenue-sharing obligation following the completion of Amylin's acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb.Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $281.1 million (pretax), or $0.16 per share, consisting of an intangible asset impairment related to liprotamase, restructuring charges related to initiatives to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, charges associated with the decision to stop development of a delivery device platform, and charges related to changes in returns reserve estimates for the withdrawal of Xigris™.RevenueOur worldwide revenue for 2013 was $23.11 billion, a 2 percent increase compared with 2012 as an increase of 5 percent due to higher prices was partially offset by a decrease of 2 percent due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 1 percent decrease due to lower volume. Total revenue in the U.S. increased 5 percent, to $12.89 billion, due to higher prices, partially offset by volume declines for Cymbalta and Zyprexa due to the loss of patent exclusivity. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, to $10.22 billion, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the continued weakness of the Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by increased volume.40The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2013 compared with 2012: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 PercentChange from ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total2012 (Dollars in millions) Cymbalta$3,960.8 $1,123.6 $5,084.4 $4,994.1 2Alimta1,209.1 1,493.9 2,703.0 2,594.3 4Humalog1,521.4 1,089.8 2,611.2 2,395.5 9Cialis942.8 1,216.6 2,159.4 1,926.8 12Humulin677.2 638.6 1,315.8 1,239.1 6Forteo511.4 733.5 1,244.9 1,151.0 8Zyprexa123.6 1,071.2 1,194.8 1,701.4 (30)Evista772.0 278.4 1,050.4 1,010.1 4Strattera446.3 262.9 709.2 621.4 14Effient376.9 131.8 508.7 457.2 11Other pharmaceutical products639.5 1,032.8 1,672.3 1,843.0 (9)Animal health products1,226.6 924.9 2,151.5 2,036.5 6Total net product sales12,407.6 9,998.0 22,405.6 21,970.4 2Collaboration and other revenue(2)482.1 225.4 707.5 633.0 12Total revenue$12,889.7 $10,223.4 $23,113.1 $22,603.4 21U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.2Collaboration and other revenue in 2013 consists primarily of royalties for Erbitux and revenue associated with Trajenta. Collaboration and other revenue in 2012 also includes revenue associated with exenatide in the United States.Sales of Cymbalta increased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, largely offset by lower demand due to the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven primarily by increased volume, partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Alimta increased 8 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices.Sales of Humalog increased 11 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, wholesaler buying patterns, and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Cialis increased 21 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by higher prices and increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Humulin increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume.Sales of Forteo increased 5 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, due to increased volume, primarily in Japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Zyprexa decreased 66 percent in the U.S. due to continued erosion following patent expiration in late 2011. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 20 percent, driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates, lower volume in markets outside of Japan, and lower prices. 41Sales of Evista increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 10 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices, partially offset by increased volume in Japan.Sales of Strattera increased 16 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven primarily by increased volume in Japan, partially offset by lower prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Sales of Effient increased 11 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven primarily by increased volume. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent driven primarily by increased volume for Trifexis® and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue remained at 78.8 percent in 2013 as higher prices were offset by the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which significantly decreased the cost of sales in 2012.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent to $7.13 billion in 2013, driven primarily by lower selling and marketing expenses resulting from ongoing cost-containment efforts, including a reduction in U.S. sales and marketing activities in anticipation of the loss of patent exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates.Research and development expenses increased 5 percent to $5.53 billion in 2013, due to higher research and clinical development expenses, including $97.2 million of milestone payments made to Boehringer Ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin.We recognized an acquired IPR&D charge of $57.1 million in 2013 resulting from our acquisition of a CGRP antibody. There were no acquired IPR&D charges in 2012. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $120.6 million in 2013. These charges included $30.0 million of asset impairments primarily associated with the anticipated closure of a packaging and distribution facility in Germany, and $90.6 million of severance costs to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. In 2012, we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $281.1 million. These charges included $122.6 million related to an intangible asset impairment for liprotamase, $74.5 million related to restructuring to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, $64.0 million related to the asset impairment of a delivery device platform, and $20.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $518.9 million in 2013, compared with income of $674.0 million in 2012. The decrease was driven primarily by lower income related to the termination of the exenatide collaboration with Amylin of $495.4 million in 2013 compared with $787.8 million in 2012, partially offset by milestone payments received from Boehringer Ingelheim for regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. See Notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our effective tax rate was 20.5 percent in 2013, compared with 24.4 percent in 2012. The 2012 effective tax rate reflected the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011 and the tax impact of the payment received from Amylin, partially offset by the tax benefit related to the intangible asset impairment for liprotamase. The decrease in the 2013 effective tax rate reflects the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. effective January 1, 2013 as well as the one-time impact of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2012 that was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.FINANCIAL CONDITIONAs of December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents remained essentially unchanged at $3.87 billion compared with $3.83 billion at December 31, 2013. Significant sources of cash included cash flows from 42operations of $4.37 billion, net proceeds from investment transactions of $3.62 billion, and net proceeds from the issuance of short- and long-term debt of $2.64 billion. Significant uses of cash included dividends paid of $2.10 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $1.16 billion, share repurchases of $800.0 million, and the acquisition of Lohmann AH which amounted to $551.4 million. We also held $5.41 billion of cash in escrow associated with the pending close of the Novartis AH acquisition which was reflected as restricted cash as of December 31, 2014. In January 2015, we completed our acquisition of Novartis AH for approximately $5.4 billion in an all-cash transaction. See ""Executive Overview—Other Matters"" for additional details.In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $5.52 billion and $9.19 billion as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.As of December 31, 2014, total debt was $8.06 billion, an increase of $2.84 billion compared with $5.21 billion at December 31, 2013. The increase is due primarily to the increase in short-term commercial paper borrowings of $2.68 billion used primarily to finance the acquisition of Novartis AH. At December 31, 2014, we had a total of $3.31 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $3.20 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. Subject to market conditions, we intend to replace the majority of our commercial paper borrowings with fixed-rate long term notes in the first half of 2015. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.For the 130th consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $1.96 per share were paid in both 2014 and 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2015, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.50 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2015 of $2.00 per share.Capital expenditures of $1.16 billion during 2014 were $150.5 million more than in 2013. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion.In 2014, we repurchased $800.0 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program previously announced in October 2013.See ""Executive Overview—Other Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection for Cymbalta (U.S. and Europe), Evista (U.S.), Alimta (U.S., Europe, and Japan), and Zyprexa (Japan). At December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate of $8.54 billion of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries. A significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the United States. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., no accrual for U.S. income taxes is provided. We believe cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs, dividends paid to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2014 and 2013, including derivatives and other interest 43rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Chinese yuan, and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face foreign currency exchange exposures primarily when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen). Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.44Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 YearsShort-term borrowings$2,680.6 $2,680.6 $— $— $—Long-term debt, including interest payments(1)8,168.6 185.9 1,588.7 1,143.3 5,250.7Capital lease obligations28.8 10.3 14.7 3.8 —Operating leases602.4 138.7 216.7 126.3 120.7Purchase obligations(2)11,166.8 9,957.5 782.1 420.6 6.6Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(3)3,219.9 — 790.7 291.7 2,137.5Total$25,867.1 $12,973.0 $3,392.9 $1,985.7 $7,515.51Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2014, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.2We have included the following:•Purchase obligations consisting primarily of all open purchase orders as of December 31, 2014. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.•Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.3We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $998.5 million, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2014. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded.We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, 45redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.When sales occur, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (generally, 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, among others, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserve may be required in the future based on revised estimates to our assumptions, which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of sales. We expect the ratio of actual product returns as a percentage of net sales to increase in future periods as we begin to experience elevated return levels for Cymbalta following the recent loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. market.We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid and managed care contracts. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid and managed care rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries), an evaluation of the current Medicaid and managed care contracts, the percentage of our products that are sold via Medicaid and managed care contracts, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid and managed care rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid and managed care rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves.We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2014, a 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability would lead to an approximate $137 million effect on our income before income taxes. 46The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was 88 percent as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid and managed care (in millions): 2014 2013Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$2,215.5 $1,584.5Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates(1) 4,707.8 4,723.3Cash payments of discounts and rebates(4,681.9) (4,092.3)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$2,241.4 $2,215.51 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1.5 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we also consider any third-party indemnification we have, including the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.Pension and Retiree Medical Plan AssumptionsPension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected rate of return, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 85 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.47If the health-care-cost trend rates were to increase by one percentage point, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2014 annual expense would increase by $7.8 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2014 service cost and interest cost by $6.6 million. If the 2014 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $35.4 million. If the 2014 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $21.7 million. If our assumption regarding the 2014 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $49.9 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 80 percent of both the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at December 31, 2014.Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each project independently.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in the “Late-Stage Pipeline” section. The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates.Income TaxesWe prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.48We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.As of December 31, 2014, a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $31.9 million and $30.1 million, respectively.LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2015 For the full year of 2015, we expect EPS to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.50. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $19.5 billion and $20.0 billion. The acquisition of Novartis AH is expected to add significant revenue. We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 75.0 percent in 2015. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, reflecting an expected increase in Phase III trial expenses and the inclusion of Novartis AH. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be in a range between $75 million and $125 million of income. The 2015 tax rate is expected to be approximately 18.5 percent, assuming a full-year 2015 benefit of the research and development tax credit and other tax provisions up for extension. If these items are not extended, the 2015 tax rate would be approximately 1.5 percentage points higher. The 2015 expected tax rate includes the tax impact of costs associated with the Novartis AH and Lohmann AH acquisitions and amortization of intangibles.Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion.Our 2015 financial guidance does not include a potential charge related to the collaboration with Pfizer to develop and commercialize tanezumab. If the partial clinical hold for the molecule is removed and we and Pfizer move forward with development, we will pay a $200 million upfront fee to Pfizer. This charge would reduce EPS by approximately $0.12 and would cause our tax rate to be approximately 1.0 percentage point lower.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) in Item 7 at “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.49",2023-12-30 16:23:23.412987

Earnings per share (EPS) data is presented on a diluted basis.Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year Ended,December 31, Percent Change from 2015 2014 2014Revenue$19,958.7 $19,615.6 2 %Gross margin14,921.5 14,683.1 2 %Gross margin as a percent of revenue74.8% 74.9% Operating expense (1)$11,329.4 $11,354.4 — %Acquired in-process research and development535.0 200.2 NMAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges367.7 468.7 (22)%Net income2,408.4 2,390.5 1 %Earnings per share2.26 2.23 1 %(1) Operating expense consists of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.NM - not meaningfulRevenue and gross margin increased slightly in 2015. Operating expense in 2015 remained essentially flat as a decrease in marketing, selling, and administrative expense was largely offset by increased research and development expense. Net income and EPS increased slightly in 2015 as a higher gross margin, lower income taxes, and decreased asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges were largely offset by increased acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges and lower other income. The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2015 and 2014 financial results:2015Acquisitions (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized expense of $153.0 million (pretax), or $0.10 per share, related to the fair value adjustments to Novartis Animal Health (Novartis AH) acquisition date inventory that has been sold.Acquired IPR&D (Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $535.0 million (pretax), or $0.33 per share, related to upfront fees paid in connection with various collaboration agreements primarily with Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer), as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to Locemia Solutions' (Locemia) intranasal glucagon. 30Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $367.7 million (pretax), or $0.25 per share, related to severance costs, integration costs, and intangible asset impairments.Debt Repurchase (Notes 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized net charges of $152.7 million (pretax), or $0.09 per share, attributable to the debt extinguishment loss of $166.7 million from the purchase and redemption of certain fixed-rate notes, partially offset by net gains from non-hedging interest rate swaps and foreign currency transactions associated with the related issuance of lower interest rate euro-denominated notes.2014 Acquired IPR&D (Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $200.2 million (pretax), or $0.12 per share, related to acquired IPR&D from various collaboration agreements.Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $92.0 million (pretax), or $0.06 per share, related to the transfer of our linagliptin and empagliflozin commercial rights in certain countries to Boehringer Ingelheim.Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $468.7 million (pretax), or $0.38 per share, related to severance costs associated with our ongoing cost containment efforts to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, and asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico.Other•We recognized a marketing, selling, and administrative expense of $119.0 million (non-tax deductible), or $0.11 per share, for an extra year of the United States Branded Prescription Drug Fee (U.S. Drug Fee) due to final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which required us to accelerate into 2014 the recording of an expense for the 2015 fee.Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.

A high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development. The process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take over a decade and cost more than $1 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success. Delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the U.S. and in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved.We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.Other MattersNovartis Animal Health AcquisitionOn January 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Novartis AH in an all-cash transaction for $5.28 billion. Novartis AH operates in approximately 40 countries. We acquired Novartis AH’s nine manufacturing sites, six dedicated research and development facilities, a global commercial infrastructure with a portfolio of approximately 600 products, a pipeline with more than 40 projects in development, and more than 3,000 employees. The combined organization has increased our animal health product portfolio, expanded our global commercial presence, and augmented our animal health manufacturing and research and development. In particular, it has provided Elanco with a greater commercial presence in the companion animal and swine markets, expanded Elanco’s presence in equine and vaccines areas, and created an entry into the aquaculture market. As a condition to the clearance of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act, following the closing of the acquisition of Novartis AH, we divested certain companion animal assets in the U.S. related to the Sentinel® canine parasiticide franchise to Virbac Corporation for approximately $410 million. The Novartis AH business we retained generated revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in 2014.36Patent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. The loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Cymbalta® in December 2013 and Evista® in March 2014, resulted in the immediate entry of generic competitors and a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected products, having, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We lost our data package protection for Cymbalta in major European countries in 2014. In 2015, we saw the entry of generic competition in all major European markets. The loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta in the European markets has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product, which over time will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We also lost patent exclusivity for the schizophrenia indication in December 2015 for Zyprexa® in Japan. We will lose our patent protection for the bipolar mania indication in April 2016 for Zyprexa in Japan. Generic versions of Zyprexa were approved in Japan in February 2016. We cannot speculate whether the generic company will apply for pricing and proceed to launch.Additionally, as described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Alimta® vitamin regimen patent, which provides us with patent protection for Alimta through June 2021 in Japan and major European countries, and through May 2022 in the U.S., has been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. Our compound patent for Alimta will expire in the U.S. in January 2017, and expired in major European countries and Japan in December 2015. We expect that the entry of generic competition for Alimta into these markets following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We are aware that a generic competitor has received approval to market a generic version of Alimta in a major European country, although we are not aware of whether this competitor's product has entered the market. Notwithstanding our patents, generic versions of Alimta were approved in Japan in February 2016. We filed preliminary injunctions against four generic competitors. We do not anticipate generic competitors to proceed to launch prior to the completion of the Sawai invalidation trial, as described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.The U.S. compound patent for Humalog® expired in 2013. Thus far, the loss of compound patent protection for Humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of Humalog and to date none have been approved in the U.S. or Europe. We are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop a similar version of Humalog, and it is difficult to predict the likelihood, timing, and impact of these products entering the market.Foreign Currency Exchange RatesAs a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound, and the British pound against the euro. While we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. Over the past two years, we have seen significant foreign currency rate fluctuations as the U.S. dollar strengthened compared to several other foreign currencies, including the euro, British pound, and Japanese yen. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations.37Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessUnited StatesIn the U.S., public concern over prices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals continues to drive the legislative debate. These policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates or other federal and state measures may be enacted. Key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity, modifications to Medicare Parts B and D, new language that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in Part D, and state-level proposals to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs. Savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and non-health care initiatives, or to manage federal and state budgets.In the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among U.S. healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals. Health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer). Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete for formula placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy, fewer side effects, or greater patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations.The main coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are now in effect through both the launch of state-based exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. An emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly for pharmaceuticals. In addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market, driven in part by ACA changes such as the 2020 implementation of the excise tax on employer-sponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit (the so-called ""Cadillac tax""), continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. At the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards quality-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.InternationalInternational operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. Such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. In addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. Given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products.38Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. The U.S. and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard. For example, the Obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S.-based companies, including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Other tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the U.S. Congress could change the tax rate and manner in which U.S. companies would be taxed. Additionally, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development issued its final recommendations of international tax reform proposals to influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate. While outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain, changes to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows.Operating Results—2015 RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by jurisdiction: Year Ended,December 31, Change in 2015 2014 Dollars PercentU.S. (1)$10,097.4 $9,134.1 $963.3 11 %Outside U.S.9,861.3 10,481.5 (620.2) (6)%Revenue$19,958.7 $19,615.6 $343.1 2 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.The following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year: 2015 vs. 2014 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume6%9 %8 %Price5%(2)%1 %Foreign exchange rates—%(13)%(7)%Percent change11%(6)%2 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the volume increase in 2015 was driven by the inclusion of revenue from Novartis AH and increased volumes for several pharmaceutical products, partially offset by the residual impact of the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista.Outside the U.S., the volume increase in 2015 was driven by the inclusion of revenue from Novartis AH and increased volumes for several pharmaceutical products.On a pro forma basis, which reflects the 2014 revenues of Novartis AH as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, our consolidated volume in 2015 would have increased by 2 percent compared with 2014. 39The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2015 compared with 2014: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 PercentChange from ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total2014Humalog$1,772.3 $1,069.6 $2,841.9 $2,785.2 2Alimta1,162.4 1,330.7 2,493.1 2,792.0 (11)Cialis®1,256.8 1,053.9 2,310.7 2,291.0 1Forteo®612.4 735.9 1,348.3 1,322.0 2Humulin®764.4 543.0 1,307.4 1,400.1 (7)Cymbalta144.6 883.0 1,027.6 1,614.7 (36)Zyprexa156.7 783.6 940.3 1,037.3 (9)Strattera®502.1 281.9 784.0 738.5 6Effient®417.6 105.4 523.0 522.2 —Cyramza277.7 106.1 383.8 75.6 NMTrulicity207.7 41.0 248.7 10.2 NMEvista61.7 175.6 237.3 419.8 (43)Other pharmaceutical products(2)738.4 785.1 1,523.5 1,472.0 3Animal health products1,541.2 1,639.8 3,181.0 2,346.6 36Total net product revenue9,616.0 9,534.6 19,150.6 18,827.2 2Collaboration and other revenue(3)481.4 326.7 808.1 788.4 2Revenue$10,097.4 $9,861.3 $19,958.7 $19,615.6 2(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.(2) Other pharmaceutical products includes revenue of $175.6 million and $46.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for Erbitux®.

Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 16 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenues of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 6 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume.40Revenues of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 7 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, wholesaler buying patterns, partially offset by decreased demand. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 21 percent, driven by decreased volume, primarily due to the loss of a government contract in Brazil, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenues of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and the management of fibromyalgia, decreased 66 percent in the U.S. due to the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 26 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the loss of exclusivity in Europe in 2014. Revenues of Zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance, increased 31 percent in the U.S., driven by adjustments to the return reserve resulting from the expiration of the period to return expired product for credit. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 15 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. We lost patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan in December 2015. Zyprexa revenues in Japan were $415.9 million in 2015, compared with $466.2 million in 2014. The revenue decrease in Japan was due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenues of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, increased 11 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, increased demand. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, largely offset by increased volume. Revenues of Effient, a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention, including patients undergoing angioplasty, atherectomy, or stent placement, increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased demand. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 17 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Revenues of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, decreased 70 percent in the U.S., due to the loss of patent exclusivity in March 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 17 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenues of animal health products in the U.S. increased 21 percent and animal health product revenues outside the U.S. increased 53 percent. The increases were driven by the inclusion of revenue from Novartis AH.On a pro forma basis, which reflects the 2014 revenues of Novartis AH as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues of animal health products in the U.S. would have decreased 1 percent, driven primarily by decreased volume in food animal products. Revenues outside the U.S. would have decreased 13 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in companion animal products, partially offset by higher realized prices and volume for food animal products. Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 74.8 percent in 2015, essentially flat compared with 2014 as the unfavorable impacts of the inclusion of Novartis AH and inventory step-up and amortization costs were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Research and development expenses increased 1 percent to $4.80 billion in 2015, driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, the inclusion of Novartis AH, and an increase in charges associated with the termination of late-stage molecules, primarily evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro, of approximately $135 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.41Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent to $6.53 billion in 2015, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 2014 charge associated with the U.S. Drug Fee, partially offset by the inclusion of Novartis AH and expenses related to new product launches. We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $535.0 million in 2015 resulting from various collaboration agreements, primarily with Pfizer, as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to Locemia's intranasal glucagon. There were $200.2 million of acquired IPR&D charges in 2014 related to various collaboration agreements, including charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us, from Boehringer Ingelheim, of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it was not yet approved. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $367.7 million in 2015. The charges relate to severance costs, integration costs for Novartis AH, and asset impairments. In 2014, we recognized charges of $468.7 million for asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. The charges included severance costs, asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico, and integration costs for the then-pending acquisition of Novartis AH. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $100.6 million in 2015, compared with income of $340.5 million in 2014. Other income in 2015 included net gains of $236.7 million on investments, partially offset by a net charge of $152.7 million related to the repurchase of $1.65 billion of debt. Other income in 2014 included net gains of $216.4 million on investments and $92.0 million of income associated with the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to Boehringer Ingelheim. See Notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Our effective tax rate was 13.7 percent in 2015, compared with 20.3 percent in 2014. The effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of a $119.0 million nondeductible charge associated with the U.S. Drug Fee. The decrease in the tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to a favorable tax impact of the net charges related to the repurchase of debt, acquired IPR&D, and asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Operating Results—2014Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year Ended,December 31, Percent Change from 2014 2013 2013Revenue$19,615.6 $23,113.1 (15)%Gross margin14,683.1 18,205.0 (19)%Gross margin as percent of revenue74.9% 78.8% Operating expense (1)$11,354.4 $12,656.9 (10)%Acquired in-process research and development200.2 57.1 NMAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges468.7 120.6 NMNet income2,390.5 4,684.8 (49)%Earnings per share2.23 4.32 (48)%(1) Operating expense consists of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.NM - not meaningfulRevenue and gross margin decreased in 2014. The decrease in operating expense in 2014 was due to decreases in both research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses. The decreases in net income and EPS for 2015 were due to lower gross margin, higher asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges, and decreased other income, partially offset by lower operating expenses, and income tax expense. 42Certain items affect the comparisons of our 2014 and 2013 results. The 2014 highlighted items are summarized in the ""Results of Operations—Executive Overview"" section. The 2013 highlighted items are summarized as follows:Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $57.1 million (pretax), or $0.03 per share, resulting from our acquisition of rights for a CGRP monoclonal antibody (see ""Results of Operations—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline"" section). Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $495.4 million (pretax), or $0.29 per share, related to the transfer to Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) of exenatide commercial rights in all markets outside the U.S.Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $120.6 million (pretax), or $0.08 per share, primarily related to severance costs, as well as asset impairment costs associated with the closure of a packaging and distribution facility in Germany.RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by jurisdiction: Year Ended,December 31, Change in 2014 2013 Dollars PercentU.S. (1)$9,134.1 $12,889.7 $(3,755.6) (29)%Outside U.S.10,481.5 10,223.4 258.1 3 %Revenue$19,615.6 $23,113.1 $(3,497.5) (15)%Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.The following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year: 2014 vs. 2013 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume(28)%7 %(13)%Price(1)%(1)%(1)%Foreign exchange rates— %(3)%(2)%Percent change(29)%3 %(15)%Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the volume decrease in 2014 was due to lower demand for Cymbalta and Evista following patent expirations, and to a lesser extent, to wholesaler buying patterns. 43The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2014 compared with 2013: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 PercentChange from ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total2013Alimta$1,229.5 $1,562.5 $2,792.0 $2,703.0 3Humalog1,627.6 1,157.6 2,785.2 2,611.2 7Cialis1,039.9 1,251.1 2,291.0 2,159.4 6Cymbalta420.5 1,194.2 1,614.7 5,084.4 (68)Humulin713.1 687.0 1,400.1 1,315.8 6Forteo539.0 783.0 1,322.0 1,244.9 6Zyprexa119.8 917.5 1,037.3 1,194.8 (13)Strattera452.5 286.0 738.5 709.2 4Effient394.5 127.7 522.2 508.7 3Evista207.2 212.6 419.8 1,050.4 (60)Other pharmaceutical products647.5 910.3 1,557.8 1,672.3 (7)Animal health products1,274.4 1,072.2 2,346.6 2,151.5 9Total net product revenue8,665.5 10,161.7 18,827.2 22,405.6 (16)Collaboration and other revenue(2)468.6 319.8 788.4 707.5 11Revenue$9,134.1 $10,481.5 $19,615.6 $23,113.1 (15)(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.(2) Collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of royalties for Erbitux and revenue associated with Trajenta.Revenues of Alimta increased 2 percent in the U.S., driven by increased volume. Revenues outside the U.S. increased 5 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices.Revenues of Humalog increased 7 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices as a result of payer contracts and greater Medicaid and Medicare utilization, as well as wholesaler buying patterns. Revenues outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenues of Cialis increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. Revenues outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by higher realized prices and increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenues of Cymbalta decreased 89 percent in the U.S. due to the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013. Revenues outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Revenues of Humulin increased 5 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. Revenues outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenues of Forteo increased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Revenues outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, driven by increased volume, primarily in Japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen.Revenues of Zyprexa decreased 3 percent in the U.S. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 14 percent, driven by decreased volume, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, and lower realized prices.Revenues of Strattera increased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Revenues outside the U.S. increased 9 percent, driven by increased volume, primarily in Japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen.44Revenues of Effient increased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent, driven by lower volume. Revenues of Evista decreased 73 percent in the U.S., due to the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity in March 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. decreased 24 percent, driven primarily by the expiration of a supply agreement in 2013, and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Animal health product revenues in the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume in food animal products and higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume in companion animal products due to competitive pressure. Revenues outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased volume in food animal products, due in part to the acquisition of Lohmann SE and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 74.9 percent in 2014, a decrease of 3.9 percentage points compared with 2013, driven primarily by lower sales of Cymbalta and Evista following U.S. patent expirations.Research and development expenses decreased 14 percent to $4.73 billion in 2014, driven primarily by lower late-stage clinical development costs. Research and development expenses in 2013 included $97.2 million of milestone payments made to Boehringer Ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 7 percent to $6.62 billion in 2014, driven primarily by the reduction in U.S. sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta and Evista, as well as ongoing cost containment efforts, partially offset by an additional $119.0 million charge in 2014 associated with the U.S. Drug Fee, an annual non-tax deductible fee enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that is imposed on us and others engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs. The final regulations issued by the IRS in 2014, accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year, from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur. This change resulted in the need to expense two years of the U.S. Drug Fee in 2014 to account for the fee imposed and paid in 2014 and the fee that would be imposed and paid in 2015.We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $200.2 million in 2014 resulting from our collaboration agreements with Adocia, AstraZeneca UK Limited, and Immunocore Limited in addition to charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us, from Boehringer Ingelheim, of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it was not yet approved. There were $57.1 million of acquired IPR&D charges in 2013 related to the acquisition of rights for the CGRP antibody. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $468.7 million in 2014. These charges included $225.5 million of severance costs and $243.2 million of asset impairment and other special charges consisting primarily of a $180.8 million asset impairment charge related to our decision to close and sell a manufacturing plant located in Puerto Rico. In 2013, we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $120.6 million. These charges included $30.0 million of asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a packaging and distribution facility in Germany and $90.6 million of severance costs. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $340.5 million in 2014, compared with income of $518.9 million in 2013. Other income in 2014 included net gains of $216.4 million on investments and $92.0 million of income related to the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to Boehringer Ingelheim. Other income in 2013 was primarily comprised of $495.4 million related to the termination of the exenatide collaboration with Amylin. See Notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Our effective tax rate was 20.3 percent in 2014, compared with 20.5 percent in 2013. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.45FINANCIAL CONDITIONAs of December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents was $3.67 billion, a decrease of $205.2 million, compared with $3.87 billion at December 31, 2014. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $4.43 billion and $5.52 billion as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.As of December 31, 2015, total debt was $7.98 billion, a slight decrease of $43.0 million compared with $8.02 billion at December 31, 2014. This decrease is due primarily to $2.68 billion of net repayments of short-term commercial paper borrowings, the repayment of $1.78 billion of fixed-rate notes in connection with the purchase and redemption of certain U.S. dollar-denominated notes in June 2015, and, to a lesser extent, the decrease in fair value of our hedged debt. These decreases were largely offset by the issuance of $4.45 billion of fixed-rate notes during 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had a total of $1.30 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.For the 130th consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $2.00 per share and $1.96 per share were paid in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2016, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.51 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2016 of $2.04 per share.Capital expenditures of $1.07 billion during 2015 were $96.4 million less than in 2014. We expect 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion.In 2015, we repurchased $749.5 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program previously announced in October 2013.See ""Results of Operations—Executive Overview—Other Matters"" section for information regarding the actual or anticipated effect of losses of exclusivity for Cymbalta (U.S. and Europe), Evista (U.S.), Alimta (U.S., Europe, and Japan), and Zyprexa (Japan). At December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $7.12 billion of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries. A significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the U.S. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., no accrual for U.S. income taxes is provided. We believe cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs, dividends paid to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may, however, affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2015 and 2014, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.46Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound, and the British pound against the euro. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.47Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows: Payments Due by Period(Dollars in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 YearsLong-term debt, including interest payments(1)$10,880.2 $192.0 $1,792.4 $939.2 $7,956.6Capital lease obligations15.8 4.9 8.5 2.4 —Operating leases934.4 132.5 244.9 181.1 375.9Purchase obligations(2)13,786.7 12,982.2 678.9 122.7 2.9Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(3)2,054.8 — 381.2 189.5 1,484.1Total$27,671.9 $13,311.6 $3,105.9 $1,434.9 $9,819.5(1) Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2015, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.(2) We have included the following:•Purchase obligations consisting primarily of all open purchase orders as of December 31, 2015. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.•Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.(3) We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $868.9 million, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2015. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded.48Sales Returns - Background and UncertaintiesWe regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.When sales occur, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (generally, 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, among others, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserve may be required in the future based on revised estimates to our assumptions, which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of sales. We expect the ratio of actual product returns as a percentage of net sales to increase in future periods as we begin to experience elevated return levels for Cymbalta following the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. market.Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and UncertaintiesWe establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid and managed care contracts. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid and managed care rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries), an evaluation of the current Medicaid and managed care contracts, the percentage of our products that are sold via Medicaid and managed care contracts, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid and managed care rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid and managed care rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves.49Financial Statement ImpactWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, a 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $158 million effect on our income before income taxes. The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was 87 percent and 88 percent as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. pharmaceutical sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid and managed care:(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$2,241.4 $2,215.5Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates(1) 6,245.1 4,707.8Cash payments of discounts and rebates(5,927.9) (4,681.9)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$2,558.6 $2,241.4(1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1.5 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesBackground and UncertaintiesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we also consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled, including the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.Financial Statement ImpactThe litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.Retirement Benefits AssumptionsBackground and UncertaintiesDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.50Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 80 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.Financial Statement ImpactIf the 2015 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $42.9 million. As of January 1, 2016, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan costs. Prior to this change, the service and interest costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate based on yield curves of high quality, fixed income debt instruments used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash outflows of our obligations. The new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the specific spot yield curve rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs is recorded in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We will account for this as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in the 2016 service and interest costs is expected to be approximately $110 million compared to the previous method.If the 2015 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $22.7 million. If our assumption regarding the 2015 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $50.4 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 75 percent of both the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at December 31, 2015.Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsBackground and UncertaintiesWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in the “Late-Stage Pipeline” section. The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.51Income TaxesBackground and UncertaintiesWe prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2015, a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $20.2 million and $29.5 million, respectively.AcquisitionsBackground and UncertaintiesTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions qualify as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. This involves determining the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the acquired set of activities meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.52The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values, significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, revenue and the discount rate.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2015, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of $33.5 million. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2016 For the full year of 2016, we expect EPS to be in the range of $2.83 to $2.93. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $20.2 billion and $20.7 billion. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, we expect revenue growth from a number of established products including Humalog, Trajenta, Cialis, Forteo, Strattera, Erbitux, and animal health products, as well as higher revenues from new products including Cyramza, Trulicity, Jardiance, Portrazza, and Basaglar. We expect this revenue growth to be partially offset by lower revenue from Alimta as a result of increased competitive pressures.We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 74 percent in 2016. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.0 billion. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be income of up to $75 million. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.0 billion to $6.2 billion. The 2016 tax rate is expected to be approximately 21 percent.Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion.Amortization associated with the transfer of Erbitux commercialization rights included in our 2016 financial guidance is subject to final acquisition accounting adjustments.Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) in Item 7 at “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.53",2023-12-30 16:23:25.664278

Ricks assumed the role of president and chief executive officer effective January 1, 2017, replacing John C. Lechleiter, who retired at the end of 2016. Lechleiter will remain chairman of our board of directors through May 31, 2017, and Ricks will assume the role of chairman effective June 1, 2017. Ricks joined the board of directors on January 1, 2017.The remainder of this section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data is presented on a diluted basis.Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year EndedDecember 31, Percent Change 2016 2015 Revenue$21,222.1 $19,958.7 6Gross margin15,567.2 14,921.5 4Gross margin as a percent of revenue73.4% 74.8% Operating expense (1)$11,695.9 $11,329.4 3Acquired in-process research and development30.0 535.0 NMAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges382.5 367.7 4Effective tax rate18.9% 13.7% Net income2,737.6 2,408.4 14Earnings per share2.58 2.26 14(1) Operating expense consists of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.NM - not meaningfulRevenue and gross margin increased in 2016. The increase in operating expense in 2016 was due to an increase in research and development expense, partially offset by a decrease in marketing, selling, and administrative expense. Net income and EPS increased in 2016 as a higher gross margin and lower acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges, were partially offset by higher operating expense, a higher effective tax rate, and lower other income.29The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2016 and 2015 financial results:2016Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $30.0 million (pretax), or $0.02 per share, related to upfront fees paid in connection with a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca. Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $382.5 million (pretax), or $0.29 per share, related to integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health (Novartis AH), other global severance costs, and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in Ireland.Other–Net, (Income) Expense (Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $203.9 million (pretax), or $0.19 per share, related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar. 2015 Acquisitions (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized expense of $153.0 million (pretax), or $0.10 per share, related to the fair value adjustments to Novartis AH acquisition date inventory that was sold.Acquired IPR&D (Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $535.0 million (pretax), or $0.33 per share, related to upfront fees paid in connection with various collaboration agreements primarily with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer), as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to Locemia Solutions' (Locemia) intranasal glucagon. Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $367.7 million (pretax), or $0.25 per share, related to severance costs, integration costs, and intangible asset impairments.Debt Repurchase (Notes 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized net charges of $152.7 million (pretax), or $0.09 per share, attributable to the debt extinguishment loss of $166.7 million from the purchase and redemption of certain fixed-rate notes, partially offset by net gains from non-hedging interest rate swaps and foreign currency transactions associated with the related issuance of lower interest rate euro-denominated notes.Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have approximately 45 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in preclinical research.The following new molecular entities (NMEs) were approved by regulatory authorities in at least one of the major geographies for use in the diseases described. The quarter in which each NME initially was approved in any major geography for any indication is shown in parentheses:Baricitinib (Olumiant®) (Q1 2017)—a Janus tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (in collaboration with Incyte Corporation).30Ixekizumab* (Taltz®) (Q1 2016)—a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to interleukin-17A for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.Necitumumab* (Portrazza®) (Q4 2015)—an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody for the treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Olaratumab* (Lartruvo™) (Q4 2016)—a human lgG1 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. The following NMEs and diagnostic agent are currently in Phase III clinical trial testing for potential use in the diseases described. The quarter in which each NME and diagnostic agent initially entered Phase III for any indication is shown in parentheses:Abemaciclib (Q3 2014)—a small molecule cell-cycle inhibitor, selective for cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and NSCLC.BACE inhibitor (Q2 2016)—an oral beta-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor for the treatment of early and mild Alzheimer's disease (in collaboration with AstraZeneca).Flortaucipir** (Q3 2015)—a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer intended to image tau (or neurofibrillary) tangles in the brain, which are an indicator of Alzheimer's disease.Galcanezumab* (Q2 2015)—a once-monthly subcutaneously injected calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody for the treatment of cluster headache and migraine prevention.Nasal glucagon* (Q3 2013)—a glucagon nasal powder formulation for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes treated with insulin.Solanezumab* (Q2 2009)—an anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody for the treatment of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. Based upon the results of our Phase III study of patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, we will not pursue regulatory submissions for solanezumab for the treatment of mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and we will not pursue development of solanezumab for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer's disease.Tanezumab* (Q3 2008)—an anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain, chronic low back pain, and cancer pain (in collaboration with Pfizer).*Biologic molecule subject to the United States (U.S.) Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act**Diagnostic agentThe following table reflects the status of each NME and diagnostic agent within our late-stage pipeline and recently approved products, including developments since January 1, 2016:CompoundIndicationU.S.EuropeJapanDevelopmentsEndocrinologyNasal glucagonSevere hypoglycemiaPhase IIIDevelopment of commercial manufacturing process is ongoing.31CompoundIndicationU.S.EuropeJapanDevelopmentsImmunologyOlumiantRheumatoid arthritisSubmittedApprovedSubmittedSubmitted to regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Japan in first quarter of 2016.

Until availability of the full data, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. A high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development. The process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take over a decade and cost more than $2 billion (DiMasi JA, Grabowski HG, Hansen RA. Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: new estimates of R&D costs, Journal of Health Economics 2016;47:20-33.). Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success. Delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the U.S. and in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved.We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.33Other MattersPatent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. The loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Evista® in March 2014 resulted in the immediate entry of generic competitors. We lost our data package protection for Cymbalta® in major European countries in 2014. In 2015, we saw the entry of generic competition in all major European markets. The loss of exclusivity for Evista in the U.S. and Cymbalta in the European markets has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the affected products, which over time has, in the aggregate, had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. We also lost patent exclusivity for the schizophrenia and bipolar mania indications in December 2015 and April 2016, respectively, for Zyprexa® in Japan. Generic versions of Zyprexa were launched in Japan in June 2016. The loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product.Additionally, as described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Alimta® vitamin regimen patents, which provide us with patent protection for Alimta through June 2021 in Japan and major European countries, and through May 2022 in the U.S., have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. Our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller European jurisdictions. Our compound patent for Alimta expired in the U.S. in January 2017, and expired in major European countries and Japan in December 2015. We expect that the entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. While the U.S. Court of Appeals recently ruled in our favor regarding the validity and infringement of the vitamin regimen patent, that patent remains the subject of inter partes review challenges as further described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. We are aware that at least two generic pemetrexed products have launched in a major European market. Notwithstanding our patents, generic versions of Alimta were also approved in Japan in February 2016. As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, each manufacturer of the generic version of Alimta has agreed not to proceed to pricing approval.We will lose our patent protection for Strattera® in the U.S. in May 2017, and Cialis® in the U.S. and major European markets in November 2017. We will also lose exclusivity for Effient® in the U.S. in October 2017, and we have authorized one generic manufacturer to enter the market as early as mid-August 2017. We expect that the entry of generic competition into these markets following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the affected products, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.The compound patent for Humalog® (insulin lispro) has expired in major markets. Thus far, the loss of compound patent protection for Humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro and to date none have been approved in the U.S. or Europe. Other manufacturers have efforts underway to bring to market a similar version of insulin lispro and we are aware that a competitor's insulin lispro product has been accepted for regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency. It is difficult to predict the impact of these products entering the market.Foreign Currency Exchange RatesAs a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound; and the British pound and Swiss franc against the euro. While we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. Over the past two years, we have seen significant foreign currency rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and several other foreign currencies, including the euro, British pound, and Japanese yen. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations. 34The impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar, resulted in a charge of $203.9 million in 2016. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the charge. As of December 31, 2016, our Venezuelan subsidiaries represented a de minimis portion of our consolidated assets and liabilities. We continue to monitor other deteriorating economies and it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future. Any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations.Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessUnited StatesIn the U.S., public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate. These policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal and state measures may be enacted. Key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity, modifications to Medicare Parts B and D, language that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in Medicare, proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information, and state-level proposals to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs. Savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and non-health care initiatives, or to manage federal and state budgets.In the private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals. Health plans, pharmaceutical benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer). Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy, fewer side effects, or greater patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations.The main coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are currently in effect through both state-based exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. An emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly for pharmaceuticals. In addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market, driven in part by ACA changes such as the 2020 implementation of the excise tax on employer-sponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit (the so-called ""Cadillac tax""), continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. President Trump, the new administration, and Congress have identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a top priority. The proposed timeframe remains unclear. Further, provisions included in legislation repealing the ACA and any potential replacement program have yet to be determined and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards performance-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.35InternationalInternational operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. Such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. In addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. Given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products.Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. The U.S. and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard. For example, the Trump administration has stated that one of its top priorities is comprehensive tax reform. The tax rates and the manner in which U.S. companies are taxed could be altered by any such potential tax reform and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development issued its final recommendations of international tax reform proposals to influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate. Other institutions have also become more active regarding tax-related matters, including the European Commission, the United Nations, the Group of Twenty, and the European Parliament. While outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain, changes to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.AcquisitionsSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the following acquisitions:•Our agreement to purchase CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CoLucid) for $46.50 per share or approximately $960 million, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2017. •Our acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc.'s U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccine portfolio, completed on January 3, 2017, in an all-cash transaction for approximately $885 million.•Our acquisition of Novartis AH, completed on January 1, 2015, in an all-cash transaction for $5.28 billion.Operating Results—2016 RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region: Year EndedDecember 31, 2016 2015 Percent ChangeU.S. (1)$11,506.2 $10,097.4 14Outside U.S.9,715.9 9,861.3 (1)Revenue$21,222.1 $19,958.7 6Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.36The following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year: 2016 vs. 2015 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume12%2 %7%Price2%(3)%—%Foreign exchange rates—%(1)%—%Percent change14%(1)%6%Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the volume increase in 2016 was driven by sales of several pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity®, Humalog, Erbitux® (due to the transfer of commercialization rights to us in the U.S. and Canada effective October 1, 2015), Taltz, and Jardiance®, partially offset by decreased volume for Zyprexa. U.S. revenue also benefited from reductions to the Cymbalta reserve for expected product returns of approximately $175 million in 2016, favorably affecting both volume and price.Outside the U.S., the volume increase in 2016 was driven by sales of several new pharmaceutical products, including Cyramza and Trulicity, partially offset by the losses of exclusivity for Cymbalta in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan, as well as Alimta in several countries.

Revenue outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.37Revenue of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, increased 17 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices. We will lose our patent protection for Cialis in the U.S. in November 2017. We expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased volume, partially offset by higher realized prices.Revenue of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand due to competitive pressure. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 11 percent, driven primarily by the loss of exclusivity in several countries. We have faced and remain exposed to generic entry in multiple countries that has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue from current levels.Revenue of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, increased 26 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by lower realized prices, largely offset by increased volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 13 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The increase in realized prices resulted from a change in estimate of a government rebate in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 7 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, decreased volume and lower realized prices.Revenue of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and the management of fibromyalgia, was $269.3 million in the U.S. in 2016, compared to $144.6 million in 2015. U.S. revenue benefited from reductions to the Cymbalta reserve for expected product returns of approximately $175 million in 2016. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 25 percent, driven by the loss of exclusivity.Revenue of Trulicity, a treatment for type 2 diabetes, was $737.6 million in the U.S., driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and increased share of market for Trulicity. Revenue outside the U.S. was $187.9 million.Revenue of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, increased 7 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. We will lose our patent protection for Strattera in the U.S. in May 2017. We expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 13 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue of Zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance, decreased 16 percent outside the U.S., driven primarily by decreased volumes in Japan due to the entry of generic competition in June 2016 following the loss of patent exclusivity. Zyprexa revenue in Japan was $332.3 million in 2016, compared with $415.9 million in 2015. Revenue of Erbitux, a treatment for various cancers, increased to $581.1 million in the U.S. in 2016, compared to $386.7 million in 2015. The increase was due to the transfer of commercialization rights to us in the U.S. and Canada which occurred on October 1, 2015. Revenue of animal health products in the U.S. increased 1 percent, primarily due to uptake of new companion animal products, partially offset by decreased revenue for food animal products. Animal health product revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 73.4 percent in 2016, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared with 2015 primarily due to a lower benefit from foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Research and development expense increased 9 percent to $5.24 billion in 2016, driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs and, to a lesser extent, higher charges related to development milestone payments.38Marketing, selling, and administrative expense decreased 1 percent to $6.45 billion in 2016, as reduced spending on late-life-cycle products was largely offset by expenses related to new products.We recognized an acquired IPR&D charge of $30.0 million in 2016 associated with the agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop MEDI1814. There were $535.0 million of acquired IPR&D charges in 2015 resulting from business development activity, primarily a collaboration with Pfizer and the acquisition of worldwide rights to Locemia's intranasal glucagon. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $382.5 million in 2016. The charges are primarily associated with integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of Novartis AH, other global severance costs associated with actions taken to reduce cost structure, and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in Ireland. In 2015, we recognized $367.7 million of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges related to severance costs, integration costs for Novartis AH, and asset impairments. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was expense of $84.8 million in 2016, compared with income of $100.6 million in 2015. Other expense in 2016 included a $203.9 million charge related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar, partially offset by net gains of $101.6 million on investments. Other income in 2015 included net gains of $236.7 million on investments, partially offset by a net charge of $152.7 million related to the repurchase of $1.65 billion of debt. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Our effective tax rate was 18.9 percent in 2016, compared with 13.7 percent in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 reflects several factors in both years: in 2016, the unfavorable tax effect of the charge related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis and certain asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges; and in 2015, the favorable tax impact of the acquired IPR&D charges, net charges related to the repurchase of debt, and asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 was partially offset by a net discrete tax benefit.Operating Results—2015Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year EndedDecember 31, Percent Change 2015 2014 Revenue$19,958.7 $19,615.6 2Gross margin14,921.5 14,683.1 2Gross margin as percent of revenue74.8% 74.9% Operating expense (1)$11,329.4 $11,354.4 —Acquired in-process research and development535.0 200.2 NMAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges367.7 468.7 (22)Net income2,408.4 2,390.5 1Earnings per share2.26 2.23 1(1) Operating expense consists of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expense.NM - not meaningfulRevenue and gross margin increased slightly in 2015. Operating expense in 2015 remained essentially flat as a decrease in marketing, selling, and administrative expense was largely offset by increased research and development expense. Net income and EPS increased slightly in 2015 as a higher gross margin, lower income taxes, and decreased asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges were largely offset by increased acquired IPR&D charges and lower other income. 39Certain items affect the comparisons of our 2015 and 2014 results. The 2015 highlighted items are summarized in the ""Results of Operations—Executive Overview"" section. The 2014 highlighted items are summarized as follows:Acquired IPR&D (Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $200.2 million (pretax), or $0.12 per share, related to acquired IPR&D from various collaboration agreements.Collaborations (Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized income of $92.0 million (pretax), or $0.06 per share, related to the transfer of our linagliptin and empagliflozin commercial rights in certain countries to Boehringer Ingelheim.Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $468.7 million (pretax), or $0.38 per share, related to severance costs associated with our ongoing cost containment efforts to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, and asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico.Other•We recognized a marketing, selling, and administrative expense of $119.0 million (non-tax deductible), or $0.11 per share, for an extra year of the U.S. Branded Prescription Drug Fee (U.S. Drug Fee) due to final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service which required us to accelerate into 2014 the recording of an expense for the 2015 fee.RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region: Year EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 Percent ChangeU.S. (1)$10,097.4 $9,134.1 11Outside U.S.9,861.3 10,481.5 (6)Revenue$19,958.7 $19,615.6 2Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.The following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year: 2015 vs. 2014 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume6%9 %8 %Price5%(2)%1 %Foreign exchange rates—%(13)%(7)%Percent change11%(6)%2 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the volume increase in 2015 was driven by the inclusion of revenue from Novartis AH and increased volumes for several pharmaceutical products, partially offset by the residual impact of the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista.Outside the U.S., the volume increase in 2015 was driven by the inclusion of revenue from Novartis AH and increased volumes for several pharmaceutical products. On a pro forma basis, which reflects the 2014 revenue of Novartis AH as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, our consolidated volume in 2015 would have increased by 2 percent compared with 2014. 40The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2015 compared with 2014: Year EndedDecember 31, 2015 2014 ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total TotalPercent ChangeHumalog$1,772.3 $1,069.6 $2,841.9 $2,785.2 2Alimta1,162.4 1,330.7 2,493.1 2,792.0 (11)Cialis1,256.8 1,053.9 2,310.7 2,291.0 1Forteo612.4 735.9 1,348.3 1,322.0 2Humulin764.4 543.0 1,307.4 1,400.1 (7)Cymbalta144.6 883.0 1,027.6 1,614.7 (36)Zyprexa156.7 783.6 940.3 1,037.3 (9)Strattera502.1 281.9 784.0 738.5 6Effient417.6 105.4 523.0 522.2 —Erbitux386.7 98.3 485.0 373.3 30Cyramza277.7 106.1 383.8 75.6 NMTrulicity207.7 41.0 248.7 10.2 NMEvista61.7 175.6 237.3 419.8 (43)Other human pharmaceutical products833.1 1,013.5 1,846.6 1,887.1 (2)Animal health products1,541.2 1,639.8 3,181.0 2,346.6 36Revenue$10,097.4 $9,861.3 $19,958.7 $19,615.6 2Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.NM - not meaningfulRevenue of Humalog increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volume.

Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 15 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices, partially offset by increased volume. Revenue of Cialis increased 21 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 16 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Forteo increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 6 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume.Revenue of Humulin increased 7 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, wholesaler buying patterns, partially offset by decreased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 21 percent, driven by decreased volume, primarily due to the loss of a government contract in Brazil, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Cymbalta decreased 66 percent in the U.S. due to the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 26 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the loss of exclusivity in Europe in 2014. Revenue of Zyprexa increased 31 percent in the U.S., driven by adjustments to the return reserve resulting from the expiration of the period to return expired product for credit. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 15 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. We lost patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan in December 2015. Zyprexa revenue in Japan was $415.9 million in 2015, compared with 41$466.2 million in 2014. The revenue decrease in Japan was due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Strattera increased 11 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, largely offset by increased volume. Revenue of Effient, a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention, including patients undergoing angioplasty, atherectomy, or stent placement, increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 17 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Revenue of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, decreased 70 percent in the U.S., due to the loss of patent exclusivity in March 2014. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 17 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of animal health products in the U.S. increased 21 percent and animal health product revenue outside the U.S. increased 53 percent. The increases were driven by the inclusion of revenue from Novartis AH.On a pro forma basis, which reflects the 2014 revenue of Novartis AH as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue of animal health products in the U.S. would have decreased 1 percent, driven primarily by decreased volume in food animal products. Revenue outside the U.S. would have decreased 13 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in companion animal products, partially offset by higher realized prices and volume for food animal products. Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 74.8 percent in 2015, essentially flat compared with 2014 as the unfavorable impacts of the inclusion of Novartis AH and inventory step-up and amortization costs were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Research and development expense increased 1 percent to $4.80 billion in 2015, driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, the inclusion of Novartis AH, and an increase in charges associated with the termination of late-stage molecules, primarily evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro, of approximately $135 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Marketing, selling, and administrative expense decreased 1 percent to $6.53 billion in 2015, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 2014 charge associated with the U.S. Drug Fee, partially offset by the inclusion of Novartis AH and expenses related to new product launches. We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $535.0 million in 2015 resulting from various collaboration agreements, primarily with Pfizer, as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to Locemia's intranasal glucagon. There were $200.2 million of acquired IPR&D charges in 2014 related to various collaboration agreements, including charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us, from Boehringer Ingelheim, of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it was not yet approved. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $367.7 million in 2015. The charges relate to severance costs, integration costs for Novartis AH, and asset impairments. In 2014, we recognized charges of $468.7 million for asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. The charges included severance costs, asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico, and integration costs for the then-pending acquisition of Novartis AH. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $100.6 million in 2015, compared with income of $340.5 million in 2014. Other income in 2015 included net gains of $236.7 million on investments, partially offset by a net charge of $152.7 million related to the repurchase of $1.65 billion of debt. Other income in 2014 included net 42gains of $216.4 million on investments and $92.0 million of income associated with the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to Boehringer Ingelheim. See Notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Our effective tax rate was 13.7 percent in 2015, compared with 20.3 percent in 2014. The effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of a $119.0 million nondeductible charge associated with the U.S. Drug Fee. The decrease in the tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to a favorable tax impact of the net charges related to the repurchase of debt, acquired IPR&D, and asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.FINANCIAL CONDITIONAs of December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents was $4.58 billion, an increase of $915.7 million, compared with $3.67 billion at December 31, 2015. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $6.66 billion and $4.43 billion as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.As of December 31, 2016, total debt was $10.31 billion, an increase of $2.33 billion compared with $7.98 billion at December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily due to the net issuance of $1.30 billion of short-term commercial paper borrowings and the $1.21 billion issuance of Swiss Franc debt. At December 31, 2016, we had a total of $2.87 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $2.70 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.In January 2017, we completed our acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc.'s U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccine portfolio in an all-cash transaction for approximately $885 million, including the estimated cost of inventory, which was funded through the issuance of commercial paper. In January 2017, we announced an agreement to acquire CoLucid for $46.50 per share or approximately $960 million. We anticipate issuing debt to fund the transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2017. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.For the 131st consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $2.04 per share and $2.00 per share were paid in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2016, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2017, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.52 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2017 of $2.08 per share.Capital expenditures of $1.04 billion during 2016 were $29.2 million less than in 2015. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion.In 2016, we repurchased $540.1 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program previously announced in October 2013. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.See ""Results of Operations—Executive Overview—Other Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection for Evista (U.S.), Cymbalta (Europe), Alimta (U.S., Europe, and Japan), Zyprexa (Japan), Strattera (U.S.), Effient (U.S.), and Cialis (U.S. and Europe).At December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $9.77 billion of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries. A significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the U.S. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., no accrual for U.S. income taxes is provided. We believe cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs, dividends paid to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. 43Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2016 and 2015, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound; and the British pound and Swiss franc against the euro. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.44Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows: Payments Due by Period(Dollars in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 YearsLong-term debt, including interest payment(1)$11,945.3 $832.4 $1,993.3 $392.6 $8,727.0Capital lease obligations14.4 5.4 6.9 2.1 —Operating leases873.6 134.8 230.7 169.5 338.6Purchase obligations(2)15,303.5 14,800.0 490.4 10.0 3.1Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(3)2,441.2 — 362.7 220.3 1,858.2Total$30,578.0 $15,772.6 $3,084.0 $794.5 $10,926.9(1) Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2016, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.(2) We have included the following:•Purchase obligations consisting primarily of all open purchase orders as of December 31, 2016. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.•Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.(3) We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $688.9 million, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2016. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded.45Sales Returns - Background and UncertaintiesWe regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the revenue of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product revenue discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product revenue trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.When sales occur, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (generally, 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, among others, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates to our assumptions, which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net revenue over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of revenue. Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and UncertaintiesWe establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid contracts. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid contracts, the percentage of our products that are sold via managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid contracts, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid rebate related to that sale is paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves.46Financial Statement ImpactWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016, a 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $214 million effect on our income before income taxes. The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was 85 percent and 87 percent as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. pharmaceutical sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid:(Dollars in millions)2016 2015Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$2,558.6 $2,241.4Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates(1) 8,732.8 6,245.1Cash payments of discounts and rebates(7,689.6) (5,927.9)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$3,601.8 $2,558.6(1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1.0 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesBackground and UncertaintiesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we also consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled, including the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.Financial Statement ImpactThe litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsBackground and UncertaintiesWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.47Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in “Results of Operations—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.Retirement Benefits AssumptionsBackground and UncertaintiesDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 80 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.Financial Statement ImpactIf the 2016 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $34.6 million. As of January 1, 2016, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan costs. Prior to this change, the service and interest costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate based on yield curves of high quality, fixed income debt instruments used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash outflows of our obligations. The new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the specific spot yield curve rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs is recorded in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We accounted for this as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in 2016.If the 2016 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $23.4 million. If our assumption regarding the 2016 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $43.8 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 75 percent and 80 percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets, respectively, at December 31, 2016.48Income TaxesBackground and UncertaintiesWe prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2016, a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $19.1 million and $32.4 million, respectively.AcquisitionsBackground and UncertaintiesTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. As discussed further in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, a modified definition of a business is effective for our acquisitions subsequent to October 1, 2016.If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.49The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values, significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, revenue and the discount rate.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2016, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of $22.9 million. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2017 For the full year of 2017, we expect EPS to be in the range of $2.69 to $2.79, which reflects the estimated acquired IPR&D charge related to the planned acquisition of CoLucid. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $21.8 billion and $22.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, we expect revenue growth from animal health products and a number of established pharmaceutical products including Trajenta, Forteo, and Humalog, as well as higher revenue from new products including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar®, Cyramza, Jardiance, and Lartruvo.We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 73.5 percent in 2017. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be income of up to $100 million.The 2017 tax rate is expected to be approximately 24.5 percent which reflects the non-deductibility for tax purposes of the estimated acquired IPR&D charge related to the planned acquisition of CoLucid.Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion.Amortization and inventory step-up costs associated with the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc.'s U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccines portfolio included in our 2017 financial guidance are subject to final inventory quantities purchased and acquisition accounting adjustments. The acquired IPR&D charge related to the planned acquisition of CoLucid included in our 2017 financial guidance is subject to final accounting upon completion of the acquisition.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) at Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.50",2023-12-30 16:23:24.720814

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements.

Earnings (loss) per share (EPS) data are presented on a diluted basis.Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year EndedDecember 31, Percent Change 2017 2016 Revenue$22,871.3 $21,222.1 8Gross margin16,801.1 15,567.2 8Gross margin as a percent of revenue73.5% 73.4% Operating expense (1)$11,869.9 $11,695.9 1Acquired in-process research and development1,112.6 30.0 NMAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges1,673.6 382.5 NMIncome before income taxes2,197.4 3,374.0 (35)Income Taxes2,401.5 636.4 NMNet income (loss)(204.1) 2,737.6 NMEarnings (loss) per share(0.19) 2.58 NM(1) Operating expense consists of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.NM - not meaningfulRevenue and gross margin increased in 2017. The increase in operating expense in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in marketing, selling, and administrative expense. Income before income taxes decreased in 2017 as higher asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges, acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges and, to a lesser extent, higher operating expense were partially offset by a higher gross margin. Tax expense exceeded income before income taxes in 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, resulting in a net loss for the year. Refer to “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Tax Matters” for further discussion of the 2017 Tax Act.30The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2017 and 2016 financial results:2017Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.11 billion (pretax), or $0.97 per share, primarily related to the acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CoLucid).Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $1.67 billion (pretax), or $1.23 per share, primarily associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure, including the U.S. voluntary early retirement program.Income Tax Expense (Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized a provisional tax expense of $1.91 billion, or $1.81 per share, due to the 2017 Tax Act. Refer to “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Tax Matters” for further discussion of the 2017 Tax Act. 2016 Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $30.0 million (pretax), or $0.02 per share, related to upfront fees paid in connection with a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop MEDI1814, a potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease.Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $382.5 million (pretax), or $0.29 per share, related to integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health (Novartis AH), other global severance costs, and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in Ireland.Other-Net, (Income) Expense (Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $203.9 million (pretax), or $0.19 per share, related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar. Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have approximately 40 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review and a larger number of projects in preclinical research.The following new molecular entities (NMEs) have been approved by regulatory authorities in at least one of the major geographies for use in the diseases described. The first quarter in which each NME initially was approved in any major geography for any indication is shown in parentheses:Abemaciclib (Verzenio™) (Q3 2017)—a small molecule cell-cycle inhibitor, selective for cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.Baricitinib (Olumiant®) (Q1 2017)—a Janus tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (in collaboration with Incyte Corporation).Olaratumab* (Lartruvo™) (Q4 2016)—a human lgG1 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. 31The following NME has been submitted for regulatory review in at least one of the major geographies for potential use in the disease described. The first quarter in which the NME initially was submitted in any major geography for any indication is shown in parentheses:Galcanezumab* (Q3 2017)—a once-monthly subcutaneously injected calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody for the treatment of migraine prevention.

This study is fully enrolled. Until availability of the full data, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products.We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.Other MattersElanco Animal HealthWe are reviewing strategic alternatives for Elanco Animal Health (our animal health segment), including an initial public offering, merger, sale, or retention of the business, and will provide an update no later than the middle of 2018.Patent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. We lost patent exclusivity for the schizophrenia and bipolar mania indications for Zyprexa® in Japan in December 2015 and April 2016, respectively. Generic versions of Zyprexa launched in Japan in June 2016. The loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product.We lost our patent exclusivity for Strattera® in the U.S. in May 2017, and generic versions of Strattera were approved in the same month. As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, following the settlement related to the compound patent challenge for Effient®, generic products launched in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2017. The entry of generic competition for these products has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Our compound patent protection for Cialis® (tadalafil) and Adcirca® (tadalafil) expired in major European markets and the U.S. in November 2017. However, Cialis is protected by a unit dose patent in the U.S., where we expect exclusivity to end in late September 2018 at the earliest. We expect that the entry of generic competition into these markets following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in 34revenue for the affected products, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Additionally, as described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Alimta® vitamin regimen patents, which provide us with patent protection for Alimta through June 2021 in Japan and major European countries, and through May 2022 in the U.S., have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. Our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller European jurisdictions. Our compound patent for Alimta expired in the U.S. in January 2017, and expired in major European countries and Japan in December 2015. We expect that the entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. While the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently ruled in our favor regarding the validity of the vitamin regimen patent, the generic companies which filed petitions seeking inter partes review of our vitamin regimen patent have appealed these rulings as further described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. We are aware that generic competitors have received approval to market generic versions of pemetrexed in major European markets, and that a generic product is currently on the market in at least one major European market. In light of the United Kingdom (U.K.) Supreme Court's judgment finding infringement in the U.K., Italy, France, and Spain, Actavis has withdrawn its previously launched-at-risk generic products from these markets. We will continue to seek to remove any generic pemetrexed products launched at risk in other European markets. Notwithstanding our patents, generic versions of Alimta were also approved in Japan starting in February 2016. As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, we do not currently anticipate that generic versions of Alimta will proceed to pricing approval.The compound patent for Humalog® (insulin lispro) has expired in major markets. Thus far, the loss of compound patent protection for Humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro. A similar version of insulin lispro has received approval in the U.S. and could launch soon. We are also aware that a competitor's insulin lispro product has launched in certain European markets. Other manufacturers have efforts underway to bring to market a similar version of insulin lispro in the U.S. and Europe. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect a rapid and severe decline in revenue; however, we expect competitive pressure and some loss of market share initially that would continue over time.Foreign Currency Exchange RatesAs a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. While we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. Over the past two years, we have seen significant foreign currency rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and several other foreign currencies, including the euro, British pound, and Japanese yen. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar, resulted in a charge of $203.9 million in 2016. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the charge. As of December 31, 2017, our Venezuelan subsidiaries represented a de minimis portion of our consolidated assets and liabilities. We continue to monitor other deteriorating economies and it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future. Any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations.35Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessUnited StatesIn the U.S., public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate. These policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal and state measures may be enacted. Key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity, modifications to Medicare Parts B and D, language that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in Medicare, proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information, and state-level proposals related to prescription drug prices and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs. Several states enacted legislation in 2017 related to prescription drug pricing transparency. Savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and non-health care initiatives, or to manage federal and state budgets. The Bipartisan Budget Act, enacted on February 9, 2018, will require manufacturers of brand-name drugs, biologics, and biosimilars to pay a 70 percent discount in the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap, up from the current 50 percent discount. This increase in Coverage Gap discounts will be effective beginning in 2019.In the private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals. Health plans, pharmaceutical benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer). Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy, fewer side effects, or greater patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.The main coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are currently in effect through both state-based exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. A trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly for pharmaceuticals. In addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market, driven in part by ACA changes such as the 2022 implementation of the excise tax on employer-sponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit (the so-called ""Cadillac tax""), continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. Repealing and replacing the ACA remains a priority for President Trump and Congress. Provisions included in final legislation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards performance-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.InternationalInternational operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. Such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. In addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. Given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products.36Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. The U.S. recently enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising U.S. tax law, and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting tax changes. Other organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission, are active regarding tax-related matters which could influence international tax policy in countries in which we operate. While outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain, modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.In December 2017, the President of the U.S. signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). The 2017 Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, such as the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, transition to a territorial tax system, changes to business related exclusions, deductions, and credits, and modifications to international tax provisions, including a one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the ‘Toll Tax’) on unremitted foreign earnings. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires that the income tax accounting effects from a change in tax laws or tax rates be recognized in continuing operations in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change. These effects include, among other things, re-measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities, evaluating deferred tax assets for valuation allowances, and assessing the impact of the Toll Tax and certain other provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. We were not able to completely gather, analyze, and compute all impacts of the 2017 Tax Act; therefore, the estimated income tax expense of $1.91 billion that we recorded in December 2017 related to the 2017 Tax Act is a provisional amount based upon reasonable estimates and may change upon completion of our calculations (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, changes in our interpretations of the new tax laws, along with subsequent regulations, interpretations, and guidance that have been and may be issued, may materially affect the estimates and assumptions used in recording the changes to our 2017 U.S. federal and state income tax expense that resulted from the 2017 Tax Act. Refer to “Results of Operations - Financial Condition” for discussion of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our liquidity.AcquisitionsSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our recent acquisitions of businesses and assets, including:•Our acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc.'s U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccine portfolio and other related assets (BIVIVP), completed on January 3, 2017, in an all-cash transaction for $882.1 million.•Our acquisition of CoLucid, completed on March 1, 2017, for a cash purchase price of $831.8 million, net of cash acquired.Operating Results—2017 RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region: Year EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 Percent ChangeU.S. (1)$12,785.1 $11,506.2 11Outside U.S.10,086.3 9,715.9 4Revenue$22,871.3 $21,222.1 8Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.37The following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year: 2017 vs. 2016 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume6%5 %6 %Price5%(1)%2 %Foreign exchange rates—%— %— %Percent change11%4 %8 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the revenue increase in 2017 was driven by increased volume for new pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity®, Taltz®, Basaglar®, Lartruvo, and Jardiance®, and higher realized prices for several pharmaceutical products, primarily Forteo® and Cialis, as well as increased volume for companion animal products from the acquisition of BIVIP. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume due to loss of exclusivity for Strattera and Effient, as well as decreased demand for Cialis and food animal products. Cymbalta® revenue declined, as 2016 revenue benefited from reductions to the reserve for expected product returns of approximately $175 million.Outside the U.S., the revenue increase in 2017 was due to increased volume for several new pharmaceutical products, primarily driven by Trulicity and Cyramza®. The increase in revenue was partially offset by competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity for Alimta in several countries and lower volume from the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan.The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2017 compared with 2016: Year EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total TotalPercent ChangeHumalog$1,717.8 $1,147.4 $2,865.2 $2,768.8 3Cialis1,358.6 964.5 2,323.1 2,471.6 (6)Alimta1,034.3 1,028.2 2,062.5 2,283.3 (10)Trulicity1,609.8 419.9 2,029.8 925.5 119Forteo965.2 783.8 1,749.0 1,500.0 17Humulin®884.6 450.7 1,335.4 1,365.9 (2)Cyramza278.8 479.6 758.3 614.1 23Cymbalta114.9 642.2 757.2 930.5 (19)Erbitux®541.7 104.2 645.9 687.0 (6)Strattera284.9 333.3 618.2 854.7 (28)Zyprexa75.5 505.7 581.2 725.3 (20)Taltz486.0 73.2 559.2 113.1 NMTrajenta®(2)213.2 324.7 537.9 436.6 23Jardiance(3)290.4 157.0 447.5 201.9 122Basaglar311.1 121.0 432.1 86.1 NMEffient340.1 48.8 388.9 535.2 (27)Other human pharmaceutical products767.0 927.5 1,694.3 1,564.3 8Animal health products1,511.1 1,574.5 3,085.6 3,158.2 (2)Revenue$12,785.1 $10,086.3 $22,871.3 $21,222.1 8Numbers may not add due to rounding.38(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.(2) Trajenta revenue includes Jentadueto®.(3) Jardiance revenue includes Glyxambi® and Synjardy®.NM - not meaningfulRevenue of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 2 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by higher realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts, which decreased revenue in 2016 and increased revenue in 2017. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. A similar version of insulin lispro has received tentative approval in the U.S. and could launch soon. We are also aware that a competitor's insulin lispro product has launched in certain European markets. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect a rapid and severe decline in revenue; however, we expect competitive pressure and some loss of market share initially that would continue over time. See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters"" for more information.Revenue of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, decreased 8 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 4 percent, driven by the decreased volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. We lost our compound patent protection for Cialis in major European markets in November 2017 and now expect U.S. exclusivity for Cialis to end in late September 2018 at the earliest. See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters"" for more information regarding our U.S. exclusivity. In addition to potential competition from generic tadalafil, we also currently face competition from generic sildenafil, which we expect to accelerate during 2018. We expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Revenue of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand due to competitive pressure. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 13 percent, driven by competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity in several countries. We have faced and remain exposed to generic entry in multiple countries that has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue from current levels.Revenue of Trulicity, a treatment for type 2 diabetes,increased 118 percent in the U.S., driven by increased share of market for Trulicity and growth in the GLP-1 class. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 123 percent.Revenue of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices and increased volume, primarily due to wholesaler buying patterns. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices.Revenue of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 11 percent, driven primarily by decreased volume and lower realized prices.Revenue of Cyramza, a treatment for various cancers, increased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by increased volume. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 39 percent, primarily due to strong volume growth in Japan, partially offset by lower realized prices and, to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and the management of fibromyalgia, decreased 57 percent in the U.S., driven by reductions to the reserve for expected product returns, which increased revenue by approximately $175 million in 2016. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent driven by the loss of exclusivity in Canada and Europe, partially offset by increased volume in Japan.Revenue of Erbitux, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 7 percent in the U.S. in 2017. The decrease was due to increased competition from immuno-oncology products.39Revenue of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, decreased 47 percent in the U.S., driven by the loss of exclusivity in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher realized prices. The entry of generic competition following the loss of effective patent protection has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume in Japan, partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen. Worldwide food animal revenue decreased 8 percent, primarily driven by market access and competitive pressure in the U.S. for Posilac® and Optaflexx®, respectively. Worldwide companion animal revenue increased 10 percent, driven by the inclusion of $216.7 million in revenue from the acquisition of BIVIVP, partially offset by competitive pressure. We expect these pressures for both companion animal and food animal to continue, offset in part by new product launches.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 73.5 percent in 2017, an increase of 0.1 percentage points compared with 2016 primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices, offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and product mix.Research and development expenses increased 1 percent to $5.28 billion in 2017.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 2 percent to $6.59 billion in 2017, driven by increased marketing expenses for new products that were partially offset by decreased expenses related to late life-cycle products.We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.11 billion in 2017 resulting from business development activity, primarily related to the acquisition of CoLucid. In 2016, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $30.0 million associated with the agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop MEDI1814. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $1.67 billion in 2017. The charges are primarily associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure, including the U.S. voluntary early retirement program, asset impairments related to lower projected revenue for Posilac, and asset impairments and other special charges related to product rationalizations and site closures resulting from our acquisition and integration of Novartis AH. In 2016, we recognized $382.5 million of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges primarily associated with integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of Novartis AH, other global severance costs associated with actions taken to reduce cost structure, and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in Ireland. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $52.4 million in 2017, compared with expense of $84.8 million in 2016. Other—net, (income) expense in 2016 included a $203.9 million charge related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar, partially offset by net gains of $101.6 million on investments. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.During 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $2.40 billion which included a provisional tax charge of $1.91 billion, despite earning $2.20 billion of income before income taxes. The provisional tax charge is a result of the 2017 Tax Act, including the Toll Tax. Refer to “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Tax Matters” for further discussion on the 2017 Tax Act. The effective tax rate in 2016 was 18.9 percent. 40Operating Results—2016Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year EndedDecember 31, Percent Change 2016 2015 Revenue$21,222.1 $19,958.7 6Gross margin15,567.2 14,921.5 4Gross margin as a percent of revenue73.4% 74.8% Operating expense (1)$11,695.9 $11,329.4 3Acquired in-process research and development30.0 535.0 NMAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges382.5 367.7 4Income before income taxes3,374.0 2,790.0 21Income Taxes636.4 381.6 67Net income2,737.6 2,408.4 14Earnings per share2.58 2.26 14(1) Operating expense consists of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expense.NM - not meaningfulRevenue and gross margin increased in 2016. The increase in operating expense in 2016 was due to an increase in research and development expense, partially offset by a decrease in marketing, selling, and administrative expense. Net income and EPS increased in 2016 as a higher gross margin and lower acquired IPR&D charges, were partially offset by higher operating expense, a higher effective tax rate, and lower other income.Certain items affect the comparisons of our 2016 and 2015 results. The 2016 highlighted items are summarized in the ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview"" section. The 2015 highlighted items are summarized as follows:Acquisitions (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized expense of $153.0 million (pretax), or $0.10 per share, related to the fair value adjustments to Novartis AH acquisition date inventory that was sold.Acquired IPR&D (Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $535.0 million (pretax), or $0.33 per share, related to upfront fees paid in connection with various collaboration agreements primarily with Pfizer, as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to Locemia Solutions' (Locemia) intranasal glucagon. Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $367.7 million (pretax), or $0.25 per share, related to severance costs, integration costs, and intangible asset impairments.Debt Repurchase (Notes 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized net charges of $152.7 million (pretax), or $0.09 per share, attributable to the debt extinguishment loss of $166.7 million from the purchase and redemption of certain fixed-rate notes, partially offset by net gains from non-hedging interest rate swaps and foreign currency transactions associated with the related issuance of lower interest rate euro-denominated notes.41RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region: Year EndedDecember 31, 2016 2015 Percent ChangeU.S. (1)$11,506.2 $10,097.4 14Outside U.S.9,715.9 9,861.3 (1)Revenue$21,222.1 $19,958.7 6Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.The following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year: 2016 vs. 2015 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume12%2 %7%Price2%(3)%—%Foreign exchange rates—%(1)%—%Percent change14%(1)%6%Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the volume increase in 2016 was driven by sales of several pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity, Humalog, Erbitux (due to the transfer of commercialization rights to us in the U.S. and Canada effective October 1, 2015), Taltz, and Jardiance, partially offset by decreased volume for Zyprexa. U.S. revenue also benefited from reductions to the Cymbalta reserve for expected product returns of approximately $175 million in 2016, favorably affecting both volume and price.Outside the U.S., the volume increase in 2016 was driven by sales of several new pharmaceutical products, including Cyramza and Trulicity, partially offset by the losses of exclusivity for Cymbalta in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan, as well as Alimta in several countries. 42The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2016 compared with 2015: Year EndedDecember 31, 2016 2015 ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total TotalPercent ChangeHumalog$1,685.2 $1,083.6 $2,768.8 $2,841.9 (3)Cialis1,469.5 1,002.1 2,471.6 2,310.7 7Alimta1,101.0 1,182.3 2,283.3 2,493.1 (8)Forteo770.5 729.4 1,500.0 1,348.3 11Humulin861.8 504.1 1,365.9 1,307.4 4Cymbalta269.3 661.2 930.5 1,027.6 (9)Trulicity737.6 187.9 925.5 248.7 NMStrattera534.9 319.8 854.7 784.0 9Zyprexa69.8 655.5 725.3 940.3 (23)Erbitux581.1 105.9 687.0 485.0 42Cyramza270.1 344.0 614.1 383.8 60Effient465.6 69.6 535.2 523.0 2Trajenta(2)165.9 270.7 436.6 356.8 22Other human pharmaceutical products959.4 1,006.1 1,965.4 1,727.1 14Animal health products1,564.5 1,593.7 3,158.2 3,181.0 (1)Revenue$11,506.2 $9,715.9 $21,222.1 $19,958.7 6Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.(2) Trajenta revenue includes Jentadueto.NM - not meaningfulRevenue of Humalog decreased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by lower realized prices, partially offset by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Cialis increased 17 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased volume, partially offset by higher realized prices.Revenue of Alimta decreased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand due to competitive pressure. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 11 percent, driven primarily by the loss of exclusivity in several countries. We faced exposure to generic entry in multiple countries that eroded revenue.Revenue of Forteo increased 26 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by lower realized prices, largely offset by increased volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Humulin increased 13 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The increase in realized prices resulted from a change in estimate of a government rebate in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 7 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, decreased volume and lower realized prices.Revenue of Cymbalta was $269.3 million in the U.S. in 2016, compared to $144.6 million in 2015. U.S. revenue benefited from reductions to the Cymbalta reserve for expected product returns of approximately $175 million in 2016. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 25 percent, driven by the loss of exclusivity.Revenue of Trulicity was $737.6 million in the U.S., driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and increased share of market for Trulicity. Revenue outside the U.S. was $187.9 million.43Revenue of Strattera increased 7 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 13 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue of Zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia, decreased 16 percent outside the U.S., driven primarily by decreased volumes in Japan due to the entry of generic competition in June 2016 following the loss of patent exclusivity. Zyprexa revenue in Japan was $332.3 million in 2016, compared with $415.9 million in 2015. Revenue of Erbitux increased to $581.1 million in the U.S. in 2016, compared to $386.7 million in 2015. The increase was due to the transfer of commercialization rights to us in the U.S. and Canada which occurred on October 1, 2015. Revenue of animal health products in the U.S. increased 1 percent, primarily due to uptake of new companion animal products, partially offset by decreased revenue for food animal products. Animal health product revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 73.4 percent in 2016, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared with 2015 primarily due to a lower benefit from foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Research and development expense increased 9 percent to $5.24 billion in 2016, driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs and, to a lesser extent, higher charges related to development milestone payments.Marketing, selling, and administrative expense decreased 1 percent to $6.45 billion in 2016, as reduced spending on late-life-cycle products was largely offset by expenses related to new products.We recognized an acquired IPR&D charge of $30.0 million in 2016 associated with the agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop MEDI1814. There were $535.0 million of acquired IPR&D charges in 2015 resulting from business development activity, primarily a collaboration with Pfizer and the acquisition of worldwide rights to Locemia's intranasal glucagon. See Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $382.5 million in 2016. The charges are primarily associated with integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of Novartis AH, other global severance costs associated with actions taken to reduce cost structure, and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in Ireland. In 2015, we recognized $367.7 million of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges related to severance costs, integration costs for Novartis AH, and asset impairments. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other-net, (income) expense was expense of $84.8 million in 2016, compared with income of $100.6 million in 2015. Other expense in 2016 included a $203.9 million charge related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar, partially offset by net gains of $101.6 million on investments. Other income in 2015 included net gains of $236.7 million on investments, partially offset by a net charge of $152.7 million related to the repurchase of $1.65 billion of debt. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Our effective tax rate was 18.9 percent in 2016, compared with 13.7 percent in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 reflects several factors in both years: in 2016, the unfavorable tax effect of the charge related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis and certain asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges; and in 2015, the favorable tax impact of the acquired IPR&D charges, net charges related to the repurchase of debt, and asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 was partially offset by a net discrete tax benefit.44FINANCIAL CONDITIONAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents was $6.54 billion, an increase of $1.95 billion, compared with $4.58 billion at December 31, 2016. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $7.18 billion and $6.66 billion as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.As of December 31, 2017, total debt was $13.65 billion, an increase of $3.34 billion compared with $10.31 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the cash proceeds of $2.23 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate notes and, to a lesser extent, the net increase in the balance of commercial paper outstanding of $1.40 billion, partially offset by the repayment of $630.6 million of long term debt. At December 31, 2017, we had a total of $5.57 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $5.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.For the 132nd consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $2.08 per share and $2.04 per share were paid in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2017, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2018, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.5625 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2018 of $2.25 per share.Capital expenditures of $1.08 billion during 2017 were $39.8 million more than in 2016. We expect 2018 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion.In 2017, we repurchased $359.8 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program previously announced in October 2013. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection.Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act, the U.S. will transition to a territorial tax system effective January 1, 2018; therefore, we expect that future repatriations of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. will result in immaterial or no tax payments. This change in tax law provides us with additional liquidity in the U.S. without the requirement to pay U.S. taxes as existed prior to the enactment of the new tax law. We believe cash provided by operating activities, along with available cash and cash equivalents, should be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including installment payments of the Toll Tax, dividends paid to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, we plan to deploy the additional liquidity created from the tax law across our capital allocation priorities, including; funding our existing marketed products and pipeline, including capital investments, in line with our current strategy; investing in business development to bolster our future growth prospects; returning cash to shareholders via increases to the dividend and share buybacks; and reducing our gross debt.Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2017 and 2016, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.45Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound; and the Swiss Franc against the euro. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.Individually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.46Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows: Payments Due by Period(Dollars in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 YearsLong-term debt, including interest payment(1)$14,890.4 $1,264.0 $1,131.9 $1,993.9 $10,500.6Capital lease obligations13.4 4.7 6.8 1.9 —Operating leases773.2 130.8 224.9 171.8 245.7Purchase obligations(2)16,510.4 16,285.9 224.5 — —2017 Tax Act one-time Toll Tax - provisional(3)3,245.7 259.7 519.3 519.3 1,947.4Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(4)2,026.0 — 442.9 260.3 1,322.8Total$37,459.1 $17,945.1 $2,550.3 $2,947.2 $14,016.5(1) Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2017, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.(2) We have included the following:•Purchase obligations consisting primarily of all open purchase orders as of December 31, 2017. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.•Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.(3) The 2017 Tax Act provides an election to taxpayers subject to the Toll Tax to make payments over an eight-year period. We intend to make this election; therefore, we have included future Toll Tax payments accordingly. The amounts shown reflect the provisional amount of Toll Tax recorded at December 31, 2017; these amounts are subject to change (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).(4) We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and other post-employment benefit liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $830.9 million, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2017. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. As discussed in Income Taxes later in this section, we were unable to completely assess all impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. Therefore, the estimate that we recorded is a provisional amount based upon reasonable estimates and may change upon completion of our calculations. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded.47Sales Returns - Background and UncertaintiesWe regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the revenue of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product revenue discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product revenue trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.When sales occur, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (on average, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, among others, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates to our assumptions, which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net revenue over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of revenue. Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and UncertaintiesWe establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid contracts. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid contracts, the percentage of our products that are sold via managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid contracts, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid rebate related to that sale is paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves.48Financial Statement ImpactWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, a 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $240 million effect on our income before income taxes. The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was 87 percent and 85 percent as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. pharmaceutical sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid:(Dollars in millions)2017 2016Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$3,601.8 $2,558.6Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates(1) 10,603.4 8,732.8Cash payments of discounts and rebates(10,033.2) (7,689.6)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$4,172.0 $3,601.8(1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesBackground and UncertaintiesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we also consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled, including the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsBackground and UncertaintiesWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.49Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.Retirement Benefits AssumptionsBackground and UncertaintiesDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 80 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.Financial Statement ImpactIf the 2017 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $30.0 million. As of January 1, 2016, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan costs. Prior to this change, the service and interest costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate based on yield curves of high quality, fixed income debt instruments used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash outflows of our obligations. The new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the specific spot yield curve rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs is recorded in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We accounted for this as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in 2016.If the 2017 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $23.7 million. If our assumption regarding the 2017 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $34.8 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 75 percent and 80 percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets, respectively, at December 31, 2017.Income TaxesBackground and UncertaintiesWe prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are 50subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.The 2017 Tax Act was enacted in December 2017 and introduced numerous significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. In accordance with GAAP, we recorded an estimate of the changes to our U.S. federal and state income tax expense that resulted from the 2017 Tax Act, which included re-measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities, evaluating deferred tax assets for valuation allowances, and assessing the impact of the Toll Tax and certain other provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. Since we were unable to completely assess all impacts of the 2017 Tax Act, the estimate that we recorded is a provisional amount based upon reasonable estimates and may change upon completion of our calculations (refer to ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Tax Matters"" and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the 2017 Tax Act). Assimilation of the 2017 Tax Act will be ongoing as we continue to analyze the new law and as future directives are issued, including regulations, interpretations, and guidance, which may materially affect the estimates and assumptions used in recording the changes to 2017 U.S. federal and state income tax expense.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2017, a 5 percent change in the amount of the provisional charge related to the 2017 Tax Act, uncertain tax positions, and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $95.7 million, $33.5 million, and $35.5 million, respectively.AcquisitionsBackground and UncertaintiesTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of 51operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values, significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, revenue and the discount rate.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2017, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of $12.7 million. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2018 For the full year of 2018, we expect EPS to be in the range of $4.39 to $4.49, which reflects the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $23.0 billion and $23.5 billion. Revenue growth is expected to be driven by new products including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance, Verzenio, Cyramza, Olumiant and Lartruvo.We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 73 percent in 2018. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $5.0 billion to $5.2 billion. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be income in the range of $75 million to $175 million.The 2018 tax rate is expected to be approximately 18.0 percent and reflects the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Refer to “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Tax Matters” for further discussion of the 2017 Tax Act. The 2018 tax rate benefits from a lower corporate income tax rate, partially offset by the changes to certain business exclusions, deductions, credits, and international tax provisions and is subject to change based upon changes in our interpretations of the new tax law, along with subsequent regulations, interpretations, and guidance that have been and may be issued.Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) at Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.52",2023-12-30 16:23:26.002279
59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2019,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionRESULTS OF OPERATIONS(Tables present dollars in millions, except per-share data)GeneralManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is intended to assist the reader in understanding and assessing significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of our consolidated company. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may cause our actual results, financial position, and cash generated from operations to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.Executive OverviewThis section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data are presented on a diluted basis.Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year EndedDecember 31, Percent Change 2018 2017 Revenue$24,555.7 $22,871.3 7Gross margin18,125.7 16,720.5 8Gross margin as a percent of revenue73.8% 73.1% Operating expense$11,938.9 $12,037.4 (1)Acquired in-process research and development1,983.9 1,112.6 78Asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges482.0 1,673.6 (71)Income before income taxes3,795.7 2,197.4 73Income taxes563.7 2,401.5 (77)Net income (loss)3,232.0 (204.1) NMEarnings (loss) per share3.13 (0.19) NMNM - not meaningfulRevenue and gross margin increased in 2018. The decrease in operating expense in 2018 was due to decreases in marketing, selling, and administrative expense and research and development expense. Income before income taxes increased in 2018 as a higher gross margin, lower asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges and, to a lesser extent, lower operating expense were partially offset by higher acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges. Income taxes decreased in 2018 as we recognized an income tax benefit primarily related to measurement period adjustments to the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the ‘Toll Tax’) and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provision due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). 30The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2018 and 2017 financial results:2018Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.98 billion (pretax), or $1.83 per share, primarily related to the acquisition of ARMO Biosciences Inc. (ARMO) and the collaboration with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (Dicerna).Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $482.0 million (pretax), or $0.41 per share, primarily associated with asset impairments related to the sale of the Posilac® (rbST) brand and the related sale of the Augusta, Georgia manufacturing site, as well as the suspension of commercial activities for Imrestor®. The charges also include expenses associated with the initial public offering (IPO) and separation of the Elanco animal health business, as well as efforts to reduce our cost structure.Income Tax Expense (Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized $313.3 million of income tax benefit, or $0.30 per share, primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the Toll Tax and GILTI. 2017 Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.11 billion (pretax), or $0.97 per share, primarily related to the acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CoLucid).Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).•We recognized charges of $1.67 billion (pretax), or $1.23 per share, primarily associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure, including the United States (U.S.) voluntary early retirement program. Income Tax Expense (Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized a provisional tax expense of $1.91 billion, or $1.81 per share, due to the 2017 Tax Act. Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have approximately 45 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review and a larger number of projects in preclinical research.The following new molecular entities (NMEs) have been approved by regulatory authorities in at least one of the major geographies for use in the diseases described. The first quarter in which each NME initially was approved in any major geography for any indication is shown in parentheses:Abemaciclib (Verzenio®) (Q3 2017)—a small molecule cell-cycle inhibitor, selective for cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.Baricitinib (Olumiant®) (Q1 2017)—a Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (in collaboration with Incyte Corporation).Galcanezumab* (Emgality®) (Q3 2018)—a once-monthly subcutaneously injected calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody for the treatment of migraine prevention. Refer to Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings - Other Patent Litigation"" for discussion of the lawsuit filed by Teva Pharmaceuticals International GMBH.31The following NME had received advanced approval by regulatory authorities in at least one of the major geographies for use in the diseases described, however in January 2019 we announced the phase III trial did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival. As the trial did not confirm clinical benefit, we are suspending promotion and are working with global regulators to determine the appropriate next steps:Olaratumab* (Lartruvo®) (Q4 2016)—a lgG1 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. See the ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters"" for more information.The following NMEs have been submitted for regulatory review in at least one of the major geographies for potential use in the disease described. The first quarter in which each NME initially was submitted in any major geography for any indication is shown in parentheses:Lasmiditan (Q4 2018)—an oral 5-HT1F agonist for the acute treatment of migraine. In the U.S., Lasmiditan is protected by a compound patent (2025).Nasal glucagon* (Q2 2018)—a glucagon nasal powder formulation for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes treated with insulin. In the U.S., nasal glucagon is protected by a delivery device patent (2034), with data protection (3.5 years) expected upon approval. In Europe, nasal glucagon is protected by a delivery device patent (2034), with data protection (6 years) expected upon approval.The following NMEs and diagnostic agent are currently in Phase III clinical trial testing for potential use in the diseases described but have not yet been submitted for approval for any indication. The first quarter in which each NME and the diagnostic agent initially entered Phase III for any indication is shown in parentheses:Flortaucipir** (Q3 2015)—a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer intended to image tau (or neurofibrillary) tangles in the brain, which are an indicator of Alzheimer's disease.Mirikizumab* (Q2 2018)—a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.Pegilodecakin* (Q1 2017)—a PEGylated IL-10, which has demonstrated clinical benefit as a single agent, and in combination with both chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapy, across several tumor types.Solanezumab* (Q2 2009)—an anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody for the treatment of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. Tanezumab* (Q3 2008)—an anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain, chronic low back pain, and cancer pain (in collaboration with Pfizer Inc.).Tirzepatide* (Q4 2018)—a long-acting, combination therapy of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Ultra-rapid Lispro* (Q3 2017)—an ultra-rapid insulin for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.*Biologic molecule subject to the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act**Diagnostic agentThe following table reflects the status of the recently approved products, NMEs, and diagnostic agent set forth above, as well as certain other developments to our late-stage pipeline since January 1, 2018:CompoundIndicationU.S.EuropeJapanDevelopmentsEndocrinologyNasal glucagonSevere hypoglycemiaSubmittedPhase IIISubmitted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in second quarter of 2018.

There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products.We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.34Other MattersElanco Animal HealthOn September 24, 2018, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco), a subsidiary, completed its IPO of 72.3 million shares of its common stock, which represents 19.8 percent of Elanco's outstanding shares, at $24 per share. In addition, Elanco completed a debt offering and entered into a term loan facility during the third quarter of 2018. See Notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.We have announced our intent to divest our remaining 293,290,000 shares of Elanco common stock through an exchange offer and on February 8, 2019, Elanco filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the exchange offer, our shareholders can exchange all, some, or none of their shares of our common stock for shares of Elanco common stock owned by us, subject to the specific terms and conditions of the offer described in Elanco's registration statement. The completion of the exchange offer is subject to certain conditions, including at least 146,645,000 shares of Elanco common stock being distributed in exchange for shares of our common stock validly tendered in the exchange offer, and the receipt of an opinion of counsel that the exchange offer will qualify for tax-free treatment to us and our participating shareholders. However, the conditions of the exchange offer may not be satisfied; we may exchange less than our entire interest in Elanco; or we may decide to waive one or more of these conditions, to the extent legally permissible, and consummate the exchange offer even if all of the conditions are not satisfied. If the exchange offer is not fully subscribed, we intend, from time to time, to complete subsequent exchange offers and/or pro rata spin-off of our remaining interest in Elanco.LartruvoIn January 2019, we announced that we are suspending promotion of Lartruvo because the ANNOUNCE study did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival. We are working with global regulators to determine the appropriate next steps. We expect to incur a charge in the first quarter of 2019 related to the suspension of promotion for Lartruvo. The exact amount of the charge has not yet been determined, but is estimated to be approximately $80 million (pre-tax), or approximately $0.13 per share (after tax). Revenue related to Lartruvo was $304.7 million in 2018.Patent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. We lost patent exclusivity for the bipolar mania indication for Zyprexa® in Japan in April 2016. Generic versions of Zyprexa launched in Japan in June 2016. The loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product.We lost our patent exclusivity for Strattera® in the U.S. in May 2017, and generic versions of Strattera were approved in the same month. Following a settlement related to the compound patent challenge for Effient®, generic products launched in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2017. The entry of generic competition for these products has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue, which, in the aggregate, has had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Our compound patent protection for Cialis® (tadalafil) and Adcirca® (tadalafil) expired in major European markets and the U.S. in November 2017; however, in the U.S., we were granted pediatric exclusivity through May 2018. Pursuant to a settlement agreement related to our unit dose patent in the U.S., generic tadalafil entered the U.S. market in September 2018. We expect that the entry of additional generic competition into these markets following the loss of exclusivity will continue to cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Our formulation patents for Forteo® expired in December 2018 and use patents will expire in August 2019 in major European markets and the U.S. Both the formulation patent and the use patent expire in 2019 in Japan. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of generic and/or biosimilar competition in these markets, we expect a rapid and severe decline in revenue in the U.S. as a result of generic competition when the U.S. patents expire. Outside the U.S., we expect a decline in revenue following patent expirations; however the decline may not be rapid and severe. In the aggregate, we expect that the decline in revenue will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.35The Alimta® vitamin regimen patents, which provide us with patent protection for Alimta through June 2021 in Japan and major European countries, and through May 2022 in the U.S., have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. Our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller European jurisdictions. Our compound patent for Alimta expired in the U.S. in January 2017, and expired in major European countries and Japan in December 2015. We expect that the entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending in the U.S., Europe, and Japan regarding our Alimta patents.The compound patent for Humalog® (insulin lispro) has expired in major markets. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro. A similar version of insulin lispro launched in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018 and in certain European markets in 2017. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue; however, we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time.Foreign Currency Exchange RatesAs a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. While we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in these rates could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar, resulted in a charge of $203.9 million in 2016. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the charge. As of December 31, 2018, our Venezuelan subsidiaries represented a de minimis portion of our consolidated assets and liabilities. We continue to monitor other deteriorating economies and it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future. Any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations.36Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessUnited StatesIn the U.S., public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate. These policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other cost control measures may be enacted to manage federal and state budgets. Key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity, modifications to Medicare Parts B and D, language that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in Medicare, proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information, and state-level proposals related to prescription drug prices and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs. California and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business. The Bipartisan Budget Act, enacted in February 2018, requires manufacturers of brand-name drugs, biologics, and biosimilars to pay a 70 percent discount in the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap, up from the previous 50 percent discount. This increase in Coverage Gap discounts became effective at the beginning of 2019. We expect this increase in the Coverage Gap discounts to negatively impact our results of operations by approximately $200 million in 2019. In May 2018, the White House released ""American Patients First: The Trump Administration Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs"" (Blueprint). The Administration’s corresponding request for information included more than 30 proposed policy changes. We believe the effect of certain of these proposals would be positive for our business while others would have negative consequences to our business. The effect of these proposals, and those that extend beyond the Blueprint, will depend on the details and timing of the final legislation, regulation, or guidance and could lead to a wide range of outcomes. Some of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. In January 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services released a proposed rule to reform the system of rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid Managed Care organizations, and pharmacy benefit managers. We are currently reviewing the proposed rule, the impact of which is uncertain at this time.In the private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals. Health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, increasingly through vertical integration, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer). Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy, fewer side effects, or greater patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. Value-based agreements are another tool which may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These downward pricing pressures could continue to negatively affect future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.The main coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are currently in effect through both state-based exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. A trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly for pharmaceuticals. In addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market, driven in part by ACA changes such as the 2022 implementation of the excise tax on employer-sponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit (the so-called ""Cadillac tax""), continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. Federal legislation, litigation, or administrative actions to repeal or modify some or all of the provisions of the ACA could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards performance-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.37InternationalInternational operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. Such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. As additional reforms are finalized, we will assess their impact on future revenues. In addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. Given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products.Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. The U.S. recently enacted tax reform legislation, including the 2017 Tax Act, significantly revising U.S. tax law, and other countries are actively considering or enacting tax law changes. Further, organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission are active regarding tax-related matters, which could influence international tax policy in countries in which we operate. While outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain, modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Our accounting for the effects of the 2017 Tax Act, signed into law in December 2017, is complete (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the 2017 Tax Act); however, we expect that additional guidance will be issued in 2019 which may materially affect our assumptions and estimates used to record our U.S. federal and state income tax expense resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. Refer to “Results of Operations - Financial Condition” for discussion of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our liquidity. AcquisitionsWe strategically invest in external research and technologies that we believe to complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including licensing arrangements, collaborations, and acquisitions. We view our business development activity as an important way to achieve our strategies, as we seek to bolster our pipeline and enhance shareholder value. We continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business. Since January 1, 2019, we have acquired Loxo Oncology, Inc. (Loxo). for a purchase price of $235 per share, or approximately $8 billion. We also entered into a license and collaboration agreement with AC Immune SA for an upfront fee of CHF80.0 million and $50.0 million in exchange for a note, convertible to equity at a premium. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions of businesses and assets.38Operating Results—2018 RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region: Year EndedDecember 31, 2018 2017 Percent ChangeU.S.(1)$13,875.2 $12,785.1 8Outside U.S.10,680.5 10,086.3 6Revenue$24,555.7 $22,871.3 7Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.The following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year: 2018 vs. 2017 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume9 %7 %8 %Price(1)%(3)%(1)%Foreign exchange rates— %2 %1 %Percent change8 %6 %7 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the revenue increase in 2018 was driven by increased volume for newer pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity®, Basaglar®, Taltz®, Verzenio, and Jardiance®. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume for products that have lost exclusivity, including Cialis, Effient, and Strattera, as well as lower realized prices for several pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity, Basaglar, Forteo, and Taltz.Outside the U.S., the revenue increase in 2018 was due to increased volume for several newer pharmaceutical products, primarily driven by Trulicity, Olumiant, and Taltz and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower realized prices for several pharmaceutical products.39The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2018 compared with 2017: Year EndedDecember 31, 2018 2017 ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total TotalPercent ChangeTrulicity$2,515.8 $683.3 $3,199.1 $2,029.8 58Humalog1,787.8 1,208.7 2,996.5 2,865.2 5Alimta1,131.0 1,001.9 2,132.9 2,062.5 3Cialis1,129.2 722.7 1,851.8 2,323.1 (20)Forteo757.9 817.7 1,575.6 1,749.0 (10)Humulin®910.2 421.2 1,331.4 1,335.4 —Taltz738.7 198.7 937.5 559.2 68Cyramza®291.5 529.9 821.4 758.3 8Basaglar622.8 178.5 801.2 432.1 85Cymbalta®54.3 653.7 708.0 757.2 (6)Jardiance(2)400.2 258.1 658.3 447.5 47Erbitux®531.6 103.8 635.3 645.9 (2)Trajenta®(3)224.2 350.5 574.7 537.9 7Zyprexa36.2 435.1 471.3 581.2 (19)Strattera89.7 361.1 450.8 618.2 (27)Other human pharmaceutical products1,131.1 1,136.2 2,267.4 1,694.3 34Animal health products1,523.0 1,619.5 3,142.5 3,085.6 2Revenue$13,875.2 $10,680.5 $24,555.7 $22,871.3 7Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.(2) Jardiance revenue includes Glyxambi® and Synjardy®.(3) Trajenta revenue includes Jentadueto®. Revenue of Trulicity, a treatment for type 2 diabetes, increased 56 percent in the U.S., driven by higher demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 63 percent primarily driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices.Revenue of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 4 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices due to changes in estimates to rebates and discounts. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 5 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. A similar version of insulin lispro launched in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018 and in certain European markets in 2017. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid severe decline in revenue; however, we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time.Revenue of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent, driven by lower volume due to competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity in certain European countries, including Germany, and lower realized prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. We have faced and remain exposed to generic entry in multiple countries, which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue in those countries from current levels.40Revenue of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, decreased 17 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand primarily due to the entry of generic tadalafil, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 25 percent, driven by the loss of exclusivity in Europe. We lost our compound patent protection for Cialis in major European markets in November 2017 and U.S. exclusivity ended in late September 2018. See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for more information. In addition to competition from generic tadalafil, we also currently face competition from generic sildenafil, which accelerated during 2018. We expect that the entry of generic competition due to the loss of exclusivity will continue to cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Revenue of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, decreased 21 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. Our formulation patent for Forteo expired in December 2018 in major European markets and the U.S. Our use patent for Forteo expires in August 2019 in major European markets and the U.S. Both the formulation patent and the use patent expire in 2019 in Japan. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of generic and/or biosimilar competition in these markets, we expect a rapid and severe decline in revenue in the U.S. as a result of generic competition when the U.S. patents expire. Outside the U.S., we expect a decline in revenue following patent expirations, however the decline may not be rapid and severe. See ""Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for more information.Revenue of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices primarily due to changes in segment mix and, to a lesser extent, the impact of patient affordability programs. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 7 percent, primarily driven by decreased volume and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices.Revenue of Taltz, a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis, increased 52 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased $125.6 million, driven by increased volume from recent launches, partially offset by lower realized prices.Revenue of Cyramza, a treatment for various cancers, increased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, primarily due to increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices.Revenue of Basaglar, a long-acting human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased $311.7 million in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices due to increased volume in Medicare Part D. Revenue outside the U.S. increased $57.5 million primarily driven by increased volume.Revenue of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and the management of fibromyalgia, decreased 53 percent in the U.S. driven by decreased volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 2 percent, driven by increased volume in Japan.Worldwide animal health revenue increased 2 percent, driven by higher prices, partially offset by lower volume. The overall increase in revenue included increased revenue in the companion animal disease prevention, future protein and health, and companion animal therapeutics product categories, partially offset by decreased revenue of products that are being exited.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 73.8 percent in 2018, an increase of 0.7 percentage points compared with 2017, primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower amortization expenses, offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, the timing of manufacturing production, and the negative impact of price on revenue.Research and development expenses decreased 1 percent to $5.31 billion in 2018 driven by lower development expenses for lanabecestat, partially offset by higher expenses for other late-stage assets.41Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent to $6.63 billion in 2018 due to lower expenses related to late life-cycle products, partially offset by increased marketing expenses for newer products.Both research and development expenses and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses benefited during 2018 from actions taken to reduce our cost structure.We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.98 billion in 2018 primarily related to the acquisition of ARMO and the collaboration with Dicerna. In 2017, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.11 billion primarily related to the acquisition of CoLucid. We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $482.0 million in 2018. The charges are primarily associated with asset impairments related to the sale of the Posilac (rbST) brand and the related sale of the Augusta, Georgia manufacturing site, as well as the suspension of commercial activities for Imrestor. The charges also include expenses associated with the initial public offering and separation of the Elanco animal health business, as well as efforts to reduce our cost structure. In 2017, we recognized $1.67 billion of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges primarily associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure, including the U.S. voluntary early retirement program, asset impairments related to lower projected revenue for Posilac (rbST), and asset impairments and other special charges related to product rationalizations and site closures resulting from our acquisition and integration of Novartis Animal Health (Novartis AH). Other—net, (income) expense was income of $74.8 million in 2018 compared to income of $300.5 million in 2017 driven by lower net gains on sales of investments.During 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $563.7 million while earning $3.80 billion of income before income taxes. We recognized $313.3 million of income tax benefit primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the Toll Tax and GILTI. During 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $2.40 billion, which included a provisional tax charge of $1.91 billion, despite earning $2.20 billion of income before income taxes. The provisional tax charge was a result of the 2017 Tax Act, including the Toll Tax.Operating Results—2017Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year EndedDecember 31, Percent Change 2017 2016 Revenue$22,871.3 $21,222.1 8Gross margin16,720.5 15,512.0 8Gross margin as a percent of revenue73.1% 73.1% Operating expense$12,037.4 $11,838.3 2Acquired in-process research and development1,112.6 30.0 NMAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges1,673.6 382.5 NMIncome before income taxes2,197.4 3,374.0 (35)Income taxes2,401.5 636.4 NMNet income (loss)(204.1) 2,737.6 NMEarnings (loss) per share(0.19) 2.58 NMNM - not meaningfulRevenue and gross margin increased in 2017. The increase in operating expense in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in marketing, selling, and administrative expense. Income before income taxes decreased in 2017 as higher asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges, acquired IPR&D charges and, to a lesser extent, higher operating expense were partially offset by a higher gross margin. Tax expense exceeded income before income taxes in 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, resulting in a net loss for the year. 42Certain items affect the comparisons of our 2017 and 2016 results. The 2017 highlighted items are summarized in the ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview"" section. The 2016 highlighted items are summarized as follows:Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $30.0 million (pretax), or $0.02 per share, related to upfront fees paid in connection with a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop MEDI1814, a potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $382.5 million (pretax), or $0.29 per share, related to integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of Novartis AH, other global severance costs, and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in Ireland.Other-Net, (Income) Expense (Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $203.9 million (pretax), or $0.19 per share, related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar.RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region: Year EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 Percent ChangeU.S. (1)$12,785.1 $11,506.2 11Outside U.S.10,086.3 9,715.9 4Revenue$22,871.3 $21,222.1 8Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.The following are components of the change in revenue compared to the prior year: 2017 vs. 2016 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume6%5 %6%Price5%(1)%2%Foreign exchange rates—%— %—%Percent change11%4 %8%Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the revenue increase in 2017 was driven by increased volume for newer pharmaceutical products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo, and Jardiance, and higher realized prices for several pharmaceutical products, primarily Forteo and Cialis, as well as increased volume for companion animal products from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc.'s U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccine portfolio and other related assets (BIVIVP). The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume due to loss of exclusivity for Strattera and Effient, as well as decreased demand for Cialis and food animal products. Cymbalta revenue declined, as 2016 revenue benefited from reductions to the reserve for expected product returns of approximately $175 million.Outside the U.S., the revenue increase in 2017 was due to increased volume for several new pharmaceutical products, primarily driven by Trulicity and Cyramza. The increase in revenue was partially offset by competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity for Alimta in several countries and lower volume from the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa in Japan.43The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2017 compared with 2016: Year EndedDecember 31, 2017 2016 ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total TotalPercent ChangeHumalog$1,717.8 $1,147.4 $2,865.2 $2,768.8 3Cialis1,358.6 964.5 2,323.1 2,471.6 (6)Alimta1,034.3 1,028.2 2,062.5 2,283.3 (10)Trulicity1,609.8 419.9 2,029.8 925.5 NMForteo965.2 783.8 1,749.0 1,500.0 17Humulin884.6 450.7 1,335.4 1,365.9 (2)Cyramza278.8 479.6 758.3 614.1 23Cymbalta114.9 642.2 757.2 930.5 (19)Erbitux541.7 104.2 645.9 687.0 (6)Strattera284.9 333.3 618.2 854.7 (28)Zyprexa75.5 505.7 581.2 725.3 (20)Taltz486.0 73.2 559.2 113.1 NMTrajenta(2)213.2 324.7 537.9 436.6 23Jardiance(3)290.4 157.0 447.5 201.9 NMBasaglar311.1 121.0 432.1 86.1 NMEffient340.1 48.8 388.9 535.2 (27)Other human pharmaceutical products767.0 927.5 1,694.3 1,564.3 8Animal health products1,511.1 1,574.5 3,085.6 3,158.2 (2)Revenue$12,785.1 $10,086.3 $22,871.3 $21,222.1 8Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.(2) Trajenta revenue includes Jentadueto.(3) Jardiance revenue includes Glyxambi and Synjardy.NM - not meaningfulRevenue of Humalog increased 2 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by higher realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts, which decreased revenue in 2016 and increased revenue in 2017. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Revenue of Cialis decreased 8 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 4 percent, driven by decreased volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue of Alimta decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand due to competitive pressure. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 13 percent, driven by competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity in several countries. Revenue of Trulicity increased 118 percent in the U.S., driven by increased share of market for Trulicity and growth in the GLP-1 class. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 123 percent.Revenue of Forteo increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices and increased volume, primarily due to wholesaler buying patterns. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices.Revenue of Humulin increased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 11 percent, driven primarily by decreased volume and lower realized prices.44Revenue of Cyramza increased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by increased volume. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 39 percent, primarily due to strong volume growth in Japan, partially offset by lower realized prices and, to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Cymbalta decreased 57 percent in the U.S., driven by reductions to the reserve for expected product returns, which increased revenue by approximately $175 million in 2016. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent driven by the loss of exclusivity in Canada and Europe, partially offset by increased volume in Japan.Revenue of Erbitux, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 7 percent in the U.S. in 2017. The decrease was due to increased competition from immuno-oncology products.Revenue of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, decreased 47 percent in the U.S., driven by the loss of exclusivity in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher realized prices. The entry of generic competition following the loss of effective patent protection has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume in Japan, partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen.Worldwide food animal revenue decreased 8 percent, primarily driven by market access and competitive pressure in the U.S. for Posilac (rbST) and Optaflexx®, respectively. Worldwide companion animal revenue increased 10 percent, driven by the inclusion of $216.7 million in revenue from the acquisition of BIVIVP, partially offset by competitive pressure. Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 73.1 percent in 2017, which remained flat compared with 2016.Research and development expenses increased 1 percent to $5.36 billion in 2017.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 2 percent to $6.68 billion in 2017, driven by increased marketing expenses for new products that were partially offset by decreased expenses related to late life-cycle products.We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.11 billion in 2017 resulting from business development activity, primarily related to the acquisition of CoLucid. In 2016, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $30.0 million associated with the agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop MEDI1814. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $1.67 billion in 2017. The charges are primarily associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure, including the U.S. voluntary early retirement program, asset impairments related to lower projected revenue for Posilac (rbST), and asset impairments and other special charges related to product rationalizations and site closures resulting from our acquisition and integration of Novartis AH. In 2016, we recognized $382.5 million of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges primarily associated with integration and severance costs related to the acquisition of Novartis AH, other global severance costs associated with actions taken to reduce cost structure, and asset impairments primarily related to the closure of an animal health manufacturing facility in Ireland. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other-net, (income) expense was income of $300.5 million in 2017, compared with income of $112.8 million in 2016. Other-net, (income) expense in 2016 included a $203.9 million charge related to the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.During 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $2.40 billion, which included a provisional tax charge of $1.91 billion, despite earning $2.20 billion of income before income taxes. The provisional tax charge was a result of the 2017 Tax Act. The effective tax rate in 2016 was 18.9 percent.45FINANCIAL CONDITIONAs of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $8.00 billion, an increase of $1.46 billion, compared with $6.54 billion at December 31, 2017. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $2.11 billion and $7.18 billion as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.As of December 31, 2018, total debt was $12.77 billion, a decrease of $876.2 million compared with $13.65 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the net decrease in the balance of commercial paper outstanding of $2.20 billion and the repayment of $1.01 billion of long term debt, partially offset by the debt incurred by Elanco as a result of a notes offering and entry into credit facilities totaling $2.48 billion. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.Excluding Elanco, at December 31, 2018, we had a total of $5.42 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $5.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. In January 2019, we entered into a $4.00 billion credit facility to support our commercial paper program. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.In September 2018, Elanco entered into a revolving credit agreement providing for a five-year $750.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in September 2023. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.For the 133rd consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $2.25 per share and $2.08 per share were paid in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2018, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2019, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.645 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2019 of $2.58 per share.Capital expenditures of $1.21 billion during 2018 were $133.8 million more than in 2017.In 2018, we repurchased $4.15 billion of shares. We completed the $5.00 billion share repurchase program announced in October 2013, and the board authorized a new $8.00 billion share repurchase program. There were $2.10 billion of shares repurchased under the $8.00 billion program during 2018. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. In January 2019, we initiated $3.50 billion of share repurchases that will conclude in the first half of 2019. These purchases are part of the $8.00 billion program previously authorized by the Board.We have separately announced our intent to divest our remaining interest in Elanco through an exchange offer. In the exchange offer, our shareholders can exchange all, some, or none of their shares of our common stock at a discount for shares of Elanco common stock owned by us, subject to the terms and conditions of the offer described in Elanco's registration statement, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2019.In February 2019, we completed our acquisition of Loxo for $235 per share or approximately $8 billion, which will be funded through a mixture of cash and debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection.Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act, the U.S. transitioned to a territorial tax system effective January 1, 2018; therefore, repatriations of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. provides us with additional liquidity in the U.S. without the requirement to pay U.S. taxes as existed prior to the enactment of the new tax law. We believe cash provided by operating activities, along with available cash and cash equivalents, should be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including installment payments of the Toll Tax, dividends paid to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We seek to address a 46portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2018 and 2017, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro and the Japanese yen). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.Individually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to the results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.47Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows: Payments Due by Period(Dollars in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 YearsLong-term debt, including interest payments(1)$16,605.7 $927.7 $1,690.5 $2,800.2 $11,187.3Capital lease obligations11.8 4.5 5.9 1.4 —Operating leases805.2 155.8 217.0 132.9 299.5Purchase obligations(2)17,019.6 16,805.5 204.5 9.6 —2017 Tax Act one-time Toll Tax(3)2,836.5 159.8 509.8 732.9 1,434.0Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(4)1,571.6 — 412.4 190.9 968.3Total$38,850.4 $18,053.3 $3,040.1 $3,867.9 $13,889.1(1) Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2018, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.(2) We have included the following:•Purchase obligations consisting primarily of all open purchase orders as of December 31, 2018. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.•Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.(3) The 2017 Tax Act provided an election to taxpayers subject to the Toll Tax to make payments over an eight-year period. We made this election; therefore, we have included future Toll Tax payments accordingly.(4) We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and other post-employment benefit liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $1.05 billion, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2018. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.Financial Statement ImpactWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2018, a 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $275 million effect on our income before income taxes. 48The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. pharmaceutical sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid:(Dollars in millions)2018 2017Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$4,172.0 $3,601.8Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates(1) 12,529.6 10,603.4Cash payments of discounts and rebates(12,023.4) (10,033.2)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$4,678.2 $4,172.0(1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesBackground and UncertaintiesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we also consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsBackground and UncertaintiesWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.49Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.Retirement Benefits AssumptionsBackground and UncertaintiesDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.Financial Statement ImpactIf the 2018 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $33.7 million. If the 2018 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $25.6 million. If our assumption regarding the 2018 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $49.1 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 75 percent and 80 percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets, respectively, at December 31, 2018.Income TaxesBackground and UncertaintiesWe prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.The 2017 Tax Act was enacted in December 2017 and introduced significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. In accordance with GAAP, our accounting for the effects of the 2017 Tax Act is complete 50(refer to ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Tax Matters"" and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the 2017 Tax Act). Subsequent to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, numerous items of additional guidance were issued, including Notices, Proposed Regulations, and Final Regulations. We expect that further guidance will be issued in 2019 which may change our interpretations of the new tax laws and could materially affect the estimates used to record U.S. federal and state income tax expense.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2018, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $74.5 million and $29.8 million, respectively.AcquisitionsBackground and UncertaintiesTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values, significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, revenue and the discount rate.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2018, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of $3.71 million. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.51FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2019 For the full year of 2019, we expect EPS to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.67, reflecting the anticipated impacts of the Loxo acquisition and the suspension of promotion of Lartruvo. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $25.1 billion and $25.6 billion. Revenue growth is expected to be driven by volume from newer products including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance, Verzenio, Cyramza, and Olumiant.We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 75 percent in 2019. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.0 billion, reflecting additional expenses associated with the acquisition of Loxo. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.4 billion to $6.7 billion. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be expense in the range of $175 million to $325 million, reflecting additional interest expense associated with the acquisition of Loxo.The 2019 tax rate is expected to be approximately 16.5 percent.The individual elements of the 2019 financial guidance outlined above include consolidated financial expectations for both our human pharmaceutical business and Elanco.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) at Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.52",2023-12-30 16:23:25.903685

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, may cause our actual results, financial position, and cash generated from operations to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.Executive OverviewThis section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data are presented on a diluted basis.On March 11, 2019, we completed the disposition of our remaining 80.2 percent ownership of Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco) common stock through a tax-free exchange offer. As a result, we recognized a gain on the disposition of approximately $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019 and now operate as a single segment. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year EndedDecember 31, Percent Change 2019 2018 Revenue$22,319.5 $21,493.3 4Gross margin17,598.3 16,811.6 5Gross margin as a percent of revenue78.8% 78.2% Operating expense$11,808.8 $11,026.3 7Acquired in-process research and development239.6 1,983.9 (88)Asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges575.6 266.9 NMIncome before income taxes5,265.9 3,680.1 43Income taxes628.0 529.5 19Net income from continuing operations4,637.9 3,150.6 47Net income8,318.4 3,232.0 NMEPS from continuing operations4.96 3.05 63EPS8.89 3.13 NMNM - not meaningfulRevenue increased in 2019 driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating expenses increased in 2019, reflecting higher late-stage development expenses and increased marketing expenses for recently launched products, partially offset by lower marketing expenses for late life-cycle products. The increases in net income and EPS in 2019 were driven primarily by the gain recognized on the disposition of Elanco and, to a lesser extent, lower acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges. In addition to the increase in net income, EPS in 2019 significantly benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of the Elanco exchange offer and share repurchases.29The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2019 and 2018 financial results:2019Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $239.6 million primarily related to collaborations with AC Immune SA (AC Immune), Centrexion Therapeutics Corporation (Centrexion), ImmuNext, Inc. (ImmuNext), and Avidity Biosciences, Inc. (Avidity).Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $575.6 million primarily associated with the accelerated vesting of Loxo Oncology, Inc. (Loxo) employee equity awards as a result of the closing of the acquisition of Loxo, and, to a lesser extent, charges associated with the decision to close and sell a research and development facility located in the United Kingdom (U.K).Other–Net, (Income) Expense (Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized a gain of $309.8 million on the sale of the company's antibiotics business in China.•We recognized a debt extinguishment loss of $252.5 million related to the repurchase of debt.Net Income from Discontinued Operations (Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized a gain related to the disposition of Elanco of approximately $3.7 billion. 2018 Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.98 billion primarily related to the acquisition of ARMO BioSciences, Inc. (ARMO) and the collaboration with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Dicerna).Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $266.9 million primarily associated with asset impairments related to the sale of the Posilac® (rbST) brand and the related sale of the Augusta, Georgia manufacturing site and with expenses related to our efforts to reduce our cost structure.Income Taxes (Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized $313.3 million of income tax benefit primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI).Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We have approximately 45 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review and a larger number of projects in preclinical research.The following new molecular entities (NMEs) have been approved by regulatory authorities in at least one of the major geographies for use in the conditions described. The first quarter in which the NMEs initially were approved in any major geography for any indication is shown in parentheses:Galcanezumab* (Emgality®) (Q3 2018)—a once-monthly subcutaneously injected calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody for migraine prevention and for the treatment of episodic cluster headache.

Phase III trials were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019 in all major geographies.Lung CancerSubmittedPhase III(1) The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and review of potential medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint.(2) Priority Review is designed to expedite the review of potential medicines that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications.There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies continue to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products.We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.33Other MattersPatent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. We lost our patent exclusivity for Strattera® in the U.S. in May 2017, and generic versions of Strattera were approved in the same month. Following a settlement related to the compound patent challenge for Effient®, generic products launched in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2017. The entry of generic competition for these products has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue, which, in the aggregate, has had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Our compound patent protection for Cialis® (tadalafil) and Adcirca® (tadalafil) expired in major European markets and the U.S. in November 2017; however, in the U.S., we were granted pediatric exclusivity through May 2018. Another later expiring patent (October 2020) was the subject of U.S. patent litigation and pursuant to a settlement agreement related thereto, generic tadalafil entered the U.S. market in September 2018. We have faced and remain exposed to generic competition following the loss of exclusivity, which has rapidly and severely eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue.Our formulation patents for Forteo® expired in December 2018, and our use patents expired in August 2019 in major European markets and the U.S. Both the formulation patent and the use patent expired in August 2019 in Japan. We expect further volume decline as a result of the entry of generic and biosimilar competition following the loss of patent exclusivity in these markets. In the aggregate, we expect that the decline in revenue will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.The Alimta® vitamin regimen patents, which we expect to provide us with patent protection for Alimta through June 2021 in Japan and major European countries, and through May 2022 in the U.S., have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. In the U.S., we and Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eagle) reached an agreement in December 2019 to settle all pending litigation, allowing Eagle a limited initial entry into the market with its product starting February 2022 (up to an approximate three-week supply) and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. Our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller European jurisdictions. Our compound patent for Alimta expired in the U.S. in January 2017, and expired in major European countries and Japan in December 2015. We are aware that several companies have received approval to market generic versions of pemetrexed in major European markets (including Germany, France, and the Netherlands) and that additional generic competitors may choose to launch at risk. Although we will continue to seek to remove any such products, generic product entry is resulting in some loss in revenue in these jurisdictions. We expect that further entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending in the U.S., Europe, and Japan regarding our Alimta patents.The compound patent for Humalog® (insulin lispro) has expired in major markets. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro. A competitor launched a similar version of insulin lispro in certain European markets in 2017 and in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue; however, we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time.Foreign Currency Exchange RatesAs a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. While we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expense. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in these rates could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. 34Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessU.S.In the U.S., public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate. These policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other cost control measures may be enacted to manage federal and state budgets. Key health policy initiatives affecting biopharmaceuticals include:•foreign reference pricing in Medicare and private insurance,•modifications to Medicare Parts B and D,•provisions that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in Medicare,•a reduction in biologic data exclusivity,•proposals related to Medicaid prescription drug coverage and manufacturer drug rebates,•proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information; and•state-level proposals related to prescription drug prices and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs.California and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business. The Bipartisan Budget Act, enacted in February 2018, requires manufacturers of brand-name drugs, biologics, and biosimilars to pay a 70 percent discount in the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap, up from the previous 50 percent discount. This increase in coverage gap discounts became effective at the beginning of 2019. In 2019, the White House signed into law targeted amendments to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program statute, as well as the Fair and Accurate Medicaid Pricing Act, which was part of the Continuing Appropriations Act. We do not believe these will have a material impact to our business. Several states passed importation legislation, including Colorado, Florida, Maine, and Vermont. Specifically, the state of Florida is working with the Administration to implement an importation program from Canada as early as 2020. We are currently reviewing the state legislation, as well as corresponding proposed federal rulemaking and guidance recently published by the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA, the impact of which is uncertain at this time.In the private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, increasingly through vertical integration, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer). Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy, fewer side effects, or greater patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. Value-based agreements are another tool which may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These downward pricing pressures could continue to negatively affect future consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays (including co-pay accumulator and maximizer programs). We continue to invest in patient affordability solutions (resulting in lower revenue) in an effort to assist patients in affording their medicines.35The main coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are currently in effect through both state-based exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. A trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly for pharmaceuticals. In addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. Federal legislation, litigation, or administrative actions to repeal or modify some or all of the provisions of the ACA could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards performance-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.InternationalInternational operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. Such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. As additional reforms are finalized, we will assess their impact on future revenues. In addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. Given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical products.Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. Countries around the world, including the U.S., actively consider and enact tax law changes. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax policy in countries in which we operate. Modifications to U.S. and foreign tax laws or regulations are frequently enacted and could result in material impacts to our results of operations and financial position.AcquisitionsWe strategically invest in external research and technologies that we believe to complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including licensing arrangements, collaborations, and acquisitions. We view our business development activity as an important way to achieve our strategies, as we seek to bolster our pipeline and enhance shareholder value. We continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business.In February 2019, we acquired all shares of Loxo for a purchase price of $6.92 billion, net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines, including selpercatinib (LOXO-292), an oral RET inhibitor that has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, and LOXO-305, an oral BTK inhibitor.On January 10, 2020, we announced an agreement to acquire Dermira, Inc. for a purchase price of $18.75 per share, or approximately $1.1 billion.The acquisition will expand our immunology pipeline with the addition of lebrikizumab, a novel, investigational, monoclonal antibody designed to bind IL-13 with high affinity that is being evaluated in a Phase III clinical development program for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab was granted Fast Track designation from the FDA. The FDA's fast track designation is designed to expedite the development and review of new therapies to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs.The acquisition will also expand our portfolio of marketed dermatology medicines with the addition of Qbrexza® (glycopyrronium) cloth, a medicated cloth approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating). The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Dermira's common stock. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.36Operating Results—2019 RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region: Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 Percent ChangeU.S.(1)$12,722.6 $12,391.9 3Outside U.S.9,596.8 9,101.4 5Revenue$22,319.5 $21,493.3 4Numbers may not add due to rounding.(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.The following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year: 2019 vs. 2018 U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume6 %10 %8 %Price(3)%(1)%(3)%Foreign exchange rates— %(3)%(1)%Percent change3 %5 %4 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the revenue increase in 2019 was driven by increased volume for Trulicity®, Taltz®, Verzenio®, Jardiance®, Emgality, and Basaglar®. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume for products that have lost exclusivity, primarily Cialis, lower volume for Forteo, and the impact from the product withdrawal of Lartruvo®. Additionally, the increase in revenue was partially offset by lower realized prices for several products, primarily Trulicity.Outside the U.S., the revenue increase in 2019 was primarily driven by increased volume for Trulicity, Olumiant®, Taltz, and Jardiance. The increase in revenue was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices.37The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2019 compared with 2018: Year EndedDecember 31, 2019 2018 ProductU.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total TotalPercent ChangeTrulicity$3,155.2 $972.7 $4,127.8 $3,199.1 29Humalog(2)1,669.7 1,151.0 2,820.7 2,996.5 (6)Alimta1,219.5 896.4 2,115.8 2,132.9 (1)Forteo645.5 759.1 1,404.7 1,575.6 (11)Taltz1,016.8 349.6 1,366.4 937.5 46Humulin®879.7 410.4 1,290.1 1,331.4 (3)Basaglar876.2 236.3 1,112.6 801.2 39Jardiance(3)565.9 378.3 944.2 658.3 43Cyramza®335.3 589.9 925.1 821.4 13Cialis231.7 658.8 890.5 1,851.8 (52)Cymbalta®49.6 675.8 725.4 708.0 2Trajenta®(4)224.8 365.8 590.6 574.7 3Verzenio454.8 124.9 579.7 255.0 NMErbitux®487.9 55.4 543.4 635.3 (14)Olumiant42.2 384.7 426.9 202.5 NMZyprexa®41.0 377.6 418.7 471.3 (11)Strattera30.8 211.7 242.5 450.8 (46)Emgality154.9 7.7 162.5 4.9 NMOther products641.1 990.7 1,631.9 1,885.1 (13)Revenue$12,722.6 $9,596.8 $22,319.5 $21,493.3 4Numbers may not add due to rounding.NM - Not meaningful(1) U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico.(2) Humalog revenue includes insulin lispro.(3) Jardiance revenue includes Glyxambi® and Synjardy®.(4) Trajenta revenue includes Jentadueto®. Revenue of Trulicity, a treatment for type 2 diabetes, increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven by higher demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 42 percent primarily driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices.Revenue of Humalog, an injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 7 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by lower realized prices and decreased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Included in the revenue of Humalog in the U.S. is our own insulin lispro authorized generic, which was launched in the second quarter of 2019 in order to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. A competitor launched a similar version of insulin lispro in certain European markets in 2017 and in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid severe decline in revenue. However, due to the impact of competition and due to pricing pressure in the U.S. and some international markets, we expect some price decline and loss of market share to continue over time.38Revenue of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 8 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 11 percent, driven by lower realized prices, and to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower volume resulting from the entry of generic pemetrexed in Germany. We have faced and remain exposed to generic entry in multiple countries, which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to erode revenue in those countries from current levels.Revenue of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, decreased 15 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by decreased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 7 percent, driven by decreased volume and, to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices. We expect further volume decline as a result of competitive dynamics in the U.S. and the entry of generic and biosimilar competition following the loss of patent exclusivity in the third quarter of 2019 in the U.S., Japan, and major European markets. See ""Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for more information.Revenue of Taltz, a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, increased 38 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 76 percent, driven by increased volume from recent launches, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by lower realized prices, partially offset by increased volume. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices.Revenue of Basaglar, a long-acting human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 41 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices and increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 32 percent driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices.Revenue of Jardiance, a treatment for type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, increased 41 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 47 percent, primarily driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Cyramza, a treatment for various cancers, increased 15 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, primarily due to increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices.Revenue of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, decreased 79 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand due to generic competition. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 9 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, lower volume due to the loss of exclusivity in Europe and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. We lost our compound patent protection for Cialis in major European markets in November 2017 and U.S. exclusivity ended in late September 2018. We have faced and remain exposed to generic competition following the loss of exclusivity, which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels. See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for more information. Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 78.8 percent in 2019, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared with 2018, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and lower intangibles amortization expense, partially offset by unfavorable product mix, the impact of lower realized prices on revenue, and charges resulting from the product withdrawal of Lartruvo.Research and development expenses increased 11 percent to $5.60 billion in 2019 driven by higher late-stage development expenses.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 4 percent to $6.21 billion in 2019 primarily due to increased marketing expenses for recently launched products, partially offset by lower expenses for late life-cycle products.39We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $239.6 million in 2019 resulting from business development transactions with AC Immune, Centrexion, ImmuNext, and Avidity. In 2018, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.98 billion primarily related to the acquisition of ARMO and the collaboration with Dicerna.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $575.6 million in 2019. The charges were primarily associated with the accelerated vesting of Loxo employee equity awards as part of the closing of the acquisition of Loxo, and, to a lesser extent, the charges associated with the decision to close and sell a research and development facility located in the U.K. In 2018, we recognized $266.9 million of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges primarily associated with asset impairments related to the sale of the Posilac (rbST) brand and the related sale of the Augusta, Georgia manufacturing site and with expenses associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $291.6 million in 2019 compared to income of $145.6 million in 2018 primarily driven by higher net gains on investment securities and the gain on the sale of the company's antibiotics business in China, partially offset by the charge related to the repurchase of debt and higher net interest expense.Our effective tax rate was 11.9 percent in 2019, compared with 14.4 percent in 2018. The higher effective tax rate in 2018 was primarily due to non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges.Operating Results—2018Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results: Year EndedDecember 31, Percent Change 2018 2017 Revenue$21,493.3 $19,973.8 8Gross margin16,811.6 15,526.1 8Gross margin as a percent of revenue78.2% 77.7% Operating expense$11,026.3 $11,078.6 —Acquired in-process research and development1,983.9 1,112.6 78Asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges266.9 1,331.6 (80)Income before income taxes3,680.1 2,304.8 60Income taxes529.5 2,391.2 (78)Net income (loss) from continuing operations3,150.6 (86.4) NMNet income (loss)3,232.0 (204.1) NMEarnings (loss) per share from continuing operations3.05 (0.08) NMEarnings (loss) per share3.13 (0.19) NMNM - not meaningfulRevenue increased in 2018 driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices.

Revenue outside the U.S. increased 63 percent primarily driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices.Revenue of Humalog increased 4 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices due to changes in estimates to rebates and discounts. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 5 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue of Alimta increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent, driven by lower volume due to competitive pressure and the loss of exclusivity in certain European countries, including Germany, and lower realized prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Revenue of Cialis decreased 17 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand primarily due to the entry of generic tadalafil, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 25 percent, driven by the loss of exclusivity in Europe. Revenue of Forteo decreased 21 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue of Humulin increased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices primarily due to changes in segment mix and, to a lesser extent, the impact of patient affordability programs. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 7 percent, primarily driven by decreased volume and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices.42Revenue of Taltz increased 52 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased $125.6 million, driven by increased volume from recent launches, partially offset by lower realized prices.Revenue of Cyramza increased 5 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, primarily due to increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices.Revenue of Basaglar increased $311.7 million in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices due to increased volume in Medicare Part D. Revenue outside the U.S. increased $57.5 million primarily driven by increased volume.Revenue of Cymbalta, a treatment for major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and the management of fibromyalgia, decreased 53 percent in the U.S. driven by decreased volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 2 percent, driven by increased volume in Japan.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of total revenue was 78.2 percent in 2018, an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared with 2017, primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower amortization expenses, offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, the timing of manufacturing production, and the negative impact of price on revenue.Research and development expenses decreased 1 percent to $5.05 billion in 2018 driven by lower development expenses for lanabecestat, partially offset by higher expenses for other late-stage assets.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses remained flat in 2018 compared to 2017.Both research and development expenses and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses benefited during 2018 from actions taken to reduce our cost structure.We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.98 billion in 2018 primarily related to the acquisition of ARMO and the collaboration with Dicerna. In 2017, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.11 billion primarily related to the acquisition of CoLucid. We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $266.9 million in 2018. The charges are primarily associated with asset impairments related to the sale of the Posilac (rbST) brand and the related sale of the Augusta, Georgia manufacturing site and with expenses associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure. In 2017, we recognized $1.33 billion of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges primarily associated with efforts to reduce our cost structure, including the U.S. voluntary early retirement program, and asset impairments related to lower projected revenue for Posilac (rbST). Other—net, (income) expense was income of $145.6 million in 2018 compared to income of $301.5 million in 2017 driven by lower net gains on sales of investments.During 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $529.5 million while earning $3.68 billion of income before income taxes. We recognized $313.3 million of income tax benefit primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the Toll Tax and GILTI. During 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $2.40 billion, which included a provisional tax charge of $1.91 billion, despite earning $2.30 billion of income before income taxes. The provisional tax charge was a result of the 2017 Tax Act, including the Toll Tax.43FINANCIAL CONDITIONCash and cash equivalents decreased to $2.34 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared with $7.32 billion at December 31, 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.84 billion in 2019, compared with $5.52 billion in 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 included approximately $360 million of cash paid to settle the accelerated vesting of Loxo employee equity awards (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 included approximately $500 million of net cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations (See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $2.06 billion and $2.09 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.In February 2019, we completed our acquisition of Loxo for $235 per share or approximately $6.9 billion, which was funded through a mixture of cash and debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.As of December 31, 2019, total debt was $15.32 billion, an increase of $5.02 billion compared with $10.30 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase primarily related to the net proceeds of $4.45 billion from the issuance of senior notes in February 2019. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper that was issued in connection with the acquisition of Loxo and for general corporate purposes. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of $5.21 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $5.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund any short-term borrowing needs.For the 134th consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $2.58 per share and $2.25 per share were paid in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2019, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2020, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.74 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2020 of $2.96 per share.Capital expenditures of $1.03 billion during 2019, compared to $1.21 billion in 2018.In 2019, we repurchased $4.40 billion of shares under our $8.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in June 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.50 billion remaining under this program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.On March 11, 2019, we completed the disposition of our remaining 80.2 percent ownership of Elanco common stock through a tax-free exchange offer, which resulted in a reduction in shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 65 million as of that date.In January 2020, we announced an agreement to acquire Dermira, Inc. for $18.75 per share, or approximately $1.1 billion. The acquisition will be funded through cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection.We believe cash provided by operating activities, along with available cash and cash equivalents, should be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including installment payments of the Toll Tax, dividends paid to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.44Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2019 and 2018, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro and the Japanese yen). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.Individually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.45Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments were as follows as of December 31, 2019: Payments Due by Period(Dollars in millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 YearsLong-term debt, including interest payments(1)$20,934.9 $382.2 $2,173.8 $1,381.3 $16,997.6Finance lease obligations19.0 7.0 8.8 3.2 —Operating lease liabilities720.4 138.1 193.3 116.3 272.7Purchase obligations(2)15,897.1 15,452.8 239.6 204.7 —2017 Tax Act Toll Tax(3)2,630.0 225.3 507.4 1,109.9 787.4Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(4)1,800.1 — 421.2 193.8 1,185.1Total$42,001.5 $16,205.4 $3,544.1 $3,009.2 $19,242.8(1) Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2019, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.(2) We have included the following:•Purchase obligations consisting primarily of all open purchase orders as of December 31, 2019. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.•Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.(3) The 2017 Tax Act provided an election to taxpayers subject to the Toll Tax to make payments over an eight-year period. We made this election; therefore, we have included future Toll Tax payments accordingly.(4) We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and other post-employment benefit liabilities. We excluded long-term income taxes payable of $1.20 billion, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.The contractual obligations table is as of December 31, 2019. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebate and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback contracts in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing.46Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.Financial Statement ImpactWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, a 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $270 million effect on our income before income taxes. The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, and Medicaid:(Dollars in millions)2019 2018Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$4,670.9 $4,134.0Reduction of net sales(1) 15,490.2 13,424.9Cash payments(15,525.6) (12,888.0)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$4,635.5 $4,670.9(1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesBackground and UncertaintiesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.AcquisitionsBackground and UncertaintiesTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. 47If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue growth and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsBackground and UncertaintiesWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.Retirement Benefits AssumptionsBackground and UncertaintiesDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.48Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.Annually, we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 40 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively, alternative assets). We value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. Inputs include underlying net asset values, discounted cash flows valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks.Financial Statement ImpactIf the 2019 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $29.6 million. If the 2019 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $26.5 million. If our assumption regarding the 2019 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $45.9 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 75 percent and 80 percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets, respectively, at December 31, 2019.Adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such changes are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.Income TaxesBackground and UncertaintiesWe prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from changes to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.49Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2019, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $76.5 million and $30.8 million, respectively.LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2020 For the full year of 2020, we expect EPS to be in the range of $6.18 to $6.28, which includes the anticipated impact of the Dermira acquisition. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $23.7 billion and $24.2 billion. Revenue growth is expected to be driven by volume from Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance, Verzenio, Cyramza, Olumiant, Emgality, Baqsimi, and the launch of Reyvow. Revenue growth is expected to be partially offset by lower revenue for products that have lost patent exclusivity, including the expected entry of generic competition for Forteo in the U.S. Revenue growth is also expected to be partially offset by a low-single digit net price decline in the U.S. driven primarily by rebates and legislated increases to Medicare Part D cost sharing, patient affordability programs, and net price declines in China, Japan and Europe. We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 79 percent in 2020. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $5.6 billion to $5.9 billion. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be expense in the range of $100 million to $250 million.The 2020 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 15 percent.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) at Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.50",2023-12-30 16:23:20.926474
59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2021,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionRESULTS OF OPERATIONS(Tables present dollars in millions, except per-share data)GeneralManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is intended to assist the reader in understanding and assessing significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of our consolidated company. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may cause our actual results, financial position, and cash generated from operations to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.Executive OverviewThis section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data are presented on a diluted basis.COVID-19 PandemicIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been focused on maintaining a reliable supply of our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing treatments for COVID-19; protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting our communities; and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines, particularly insulin.We have experienced negative impacts to our underlying business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including decreases in new prescriptions as a result of fewer patient visits to physician’s offices to begin or change treatment, changes in payer segment mix, and the use of patient affordability programs in the United States (U.S.) due to rising unemployment. Additionally, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreased demand as a result of lack of normal access and fewer in-person interactions by patients and our employees with the healthcare system. In certain locations in the U.S. and around the world with COVID-19 outbreaks, we temporarily halted in-person interactions by our employees with healthcare providers and increased virtual interactions. While in-person interactions have resumed in many locations, we may decide to halt such activity in the future and, in those cases, expect to resume such interactions as it is safe to do so and in compliance with applicable guidance and requirements. We may experience additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world. We remain committed to discovering and developing new treatments for the patients we serve. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we paused new clinical trial starts and enrollment in new trials in order to reduce the strain on the medical system, and we have resumed this activity in our clinical trials. However, significant delays or unexpected issues, such as higher discontinuation rates or delays accumulating data, affecting the timing, conduct, or regulatory review of our clinical trials, could adversely affect our ability to commercialize some assets in our product pipeline if the COVID-19 pandemic continues for a protracted period. 34In regards to COVID-19 therapies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and for baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We are actively working with a variety of organizations, including governmental agencies, to facilitate access to our COVID-19 treatments in various countries. However, we face unique risks and uncertainties in our development, manufacture, and uptake of potential treatments for COVID-19, including vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, higher manufacturing costs, difficulties in manufacturing sufficient quantities of our therapies, restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies, and risks related to handling, return, and/or refund of product after delivery by us. Expedited authorization processes, including our EUAs for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together, have allowed restricted distribution of products with less than typical safety and efficacy data, and additional data that become available may call into question the safety or effectiveness of our COVID-19 therapies. Additionally, the availability of superior or competitive therapies, or preventative measures, such as vaccines, coupled with the transient nature of pandemics, could negatively impact or eliminate demand for our COVID-19 therapies. In addition, we may be required to accept returns of certain product previously shipped pursuant to EUAs if the relevant EUA is revoked or terminated. Mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus could also render our therapies ineffective. Any of these risks could prevent us from recouping our substantial investments in the research, development, and manufacture of our COVID-19 therapies. Our ability to continue to operate without significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. We have taken steps to protect our employees worldwide, with particular measures in place for those working in our manufacturing sites and distribution facilities. For 2020, we were able to largely maintain our normal operations. However, uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations, global supply chain, and distribution systems, which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products and the ability of third parties on which we rely to fulfill their obligations to us, and could increase our expenses.Although the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our operations and demand for our products, it has not negatively impacted our liquidity position. We expect to continue to generate cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs and to have access to liquidity via the short-term and long-term debt markets. We also have not observed any material impairments of our assets or significant changes in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business operations, financial results, and liquidity will depend on future developments, is highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted due to, among other things, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to reduce its transmission, including widespread availability of vaccines, and the speed with which, and extent to which, more stable economic and operating conditions resume. Should the COVID-19 pandemic and any associated recession or depression continue for a prolonged period, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially impacted by lower revenues and profitability and a lower likelihood of effectively and efficiently developing and launching new medicines. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on risk factors that could impact our results.Elanco Animal Health (Elanco) DispositionOn March 11, 2019, we completed the disposition of our remaining 80.2 percent ownership of Elanco common stock through a tax-free exchange offer. As a result, we recognized a gain on the disposition of approximately $3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019 and now operate as a single segment. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 35Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results:Year Ended December 31Percent Change20202019Revenue$24,539.8 $22,319.5 10Gross margin19,056.5 17,598.3 8Gross margin as a percent of revenue77.7 %78.8 %Operating expense$12,206.9 $11,808.8 3Acquired in-process research and development 660.4 239.6 NMAsset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges131.2 575.6 (77)Income before income taxes7,229.9 5,265.9 37Income taxes1,036.2 628.0 65Net income from continuing operations6,193.7 4,637.9 34Net income6,193.7 8,318.4 (26)EPS from continuing operations6.79 4.96 37EPS6.79 8.89 (24)NM - not meaningfulRevenue increased in 2020 driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices. Operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, increased in 2020, driven primarily by approximately $450 million of development expenses for COVID-19 therapies. The decreases in net income and EPS in 2020 were driven primarily by the approximately $3.7 billion gain recognized on the disposition of Elanco in 2019, partially offset by higher gross margin and higher other income in 2020. The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2020 and 2019 financial results:2020Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $660.4 million resulting from the acquisitions of Disarm Therapeutics, Inc.

To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies continue to establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines. A delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.Other MattersPatent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. Our formulation patents for Forteo® expired in December 2018, and our use patents expired in August 2019 in major European markets and the U.S. Both the formulation patent and the use patent expired in August 2019 in Japan. We expect further volume decline as a result of the anticipated entry of generic and biosimilar competition following the loss of patent exclusivity in these markets. In the aggregate, we expect that the decline in revenue will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.The Alimta® vitamin regimen patents, which we expect to provide us with patent protection for Alimta through June 2021 in Japan and major European countries, and through May 2022 in the U.S., have been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. In the U.S., most challenges have been finally resolved in our favor, and one remains in active litigation. We and Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eagle) reached an agreement in December 2019 to settle all pending litigation, allowing Eagle a limited initial entry into the market with its product starting February 2022 (up to an approximate three-week supply) and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. We expect that the entry of generic competition in the U.S. either from an unfavorable outcome to the patent challenge or following the loss of patent exclusivity, will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.40We are aware that several companies have received approval to market generic versions of pemetrexed in major European markets and that generic competitors may choose to attempt a launch at risk. Following a final decision in the Supreme Court of Germany in July 2020 overturning the lower court and upholding the validity of our Alimta patent, several generics that were on the market at risk in Germany left. We have removed the remaining generics from the market in Germany by obtaining preliminary injunctions in our favor. In September 2020, the Paris Court of First Instance in France issued a final decision upholding the validity of our Alimta patent and found infringement by Fresenius Kabi France and Fresenius Kabi Groupe France’s (collectively, Kabi) pemetrexed product. The court issued an injunction against Kabi and provisionally awarded us damages. In January 2021, that same court issued a preliminary injunction against Zentiva France S.A.S. (Zentiva), the last remaining company with a generic pemetrexed product on the French market, and provisionally awarded us damages. In October 2020, the Court of Appeal of the Netherlands overturned a lower court decision and ruled that our Alimta patent is valid and infringed and reinstated an injunction against Kabi, thereby removing Kabi's pemetrexed product from the Netherlands market. Kabi has appealed this decision to the Netherlands Supreme Court. Kabi's generic pemetrexed product was the only at risk generic on the market in the Netherlands. Our vitamin regimen patents have also been challenged in other smaller European jurisdictions. We expect that further entry of generic competition for Alimta in major European markets following either the loss of effective patent protection or of patent exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending in the U.S., Europe, and Japan regarding, among others, our Alimta patents.The compound patent for Humalog® (insulin lispro) has expired in major markets. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro. A competitor launched a similar version of insulin lispro in certain European markets in 2017 and in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue; however, we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time.Our compound patent protection for Cymbalta® expired in Japan in January 2020. We expect generics to enter the market in mid-2021. We expect that the entry of generic competition will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue and will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Foreign Currency Exchange RatesAs a global company with substantial operations outside the U.S., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in these rates could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessU.S.In the U.S., public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate. These policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other cost control measures may be enacted to manage federal and state budgets. Key health policy initiatives affecting biopharmaceuticals include:•the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and subsequent stimulus bills that focus on ensuring availability and access to lifesaving drugs during a public health crisis, •foreign reference pricing in Medicare and private insurance,•modifications to Medicare Parts B and D,•provisions that would allow the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs in Medicare,•a reduction in biologic data exclusivity,41•proposals related to Medicaid prescription drug coverage and manufacturer drug rebates,•proposals that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose proprietary drug pricing information, and•state-level proposals related to prescription drug prices and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs.On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, former U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Orders related to the 340B Prescription Drug Program, rebate reform in Medicare Part D, drug importation including insulin, and foreign reference pricing in Medicare Part B and Part D. Although their current status is unclear given the change in presidential administration, these Executive Orders, if implemented, could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. On September 1, 2020, Lilly announced it would distribute all 340B ceiling priced products directly to covered entities and their child sites only. Lilly provides 340B discounts to a contract pharmacy only if it is a wholly owned subsidiary of a covered entity, if a covered entity does not have an in-house pharmacy or, in the case of insulin, if the subject covered entity and its contract pharmacies agree to pass along the discount to patients without any markup for dispensing fees and without billing insurance or collecting duplicate discounts. Lilly has been transparent with regulators on its distribution activity and continues to comply with all 340B program requirements. Certain covered entities and their trade associations have threatened litigation, questioning whether Lilly’s program, and similar actions by other manufacturers, violate 340B program requirements. On October 9, 2020, three covered entities sued HHS and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to compel the agencies to take enforcement action against Lilly and three other companies, among other requested relief. On October 21, 2020, a trade association representing certain covered entities sued HHS in the same court seeking to compel the agency to promulgate administrative dispute resolution regulations. On December 11, 2020, a number of associations and entities filed suit against HHS in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California requesting immediate enforcement of the contract pharmacy guidance. On December 31, 2020, the General Counsel of HHS issued an advisory opinion alleging that honoring contract pharmacy agreements is mandatory. In January 2021, Lilly filed suit against HHS, the Secretary of HHS, the HRSA, and the Administrator of the HRSA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana seeking a declaratory judgment that HHS's attempt to require manufacturers to permit contract pharmacy distribution is unlawful and a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the alternative dispute resolution process created by defendants and, with it, their application of the advisory opinion, and other related relief. The cases are pending and the impact of these cases and any subsequent litigation is uncertain. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. California and several other states have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business. Several states have also passed importation legislation, including Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Vermont. As of late 2020 several of these states were actively working with the former presidential administration to implement an importation program from Canada. On November 22, 2020, Florida announced it submitted a proposed importation plan to the U.S. In 2020, HHS and the FDA also took several actions to advance state importation initiatives, including issuing requests for proposals for personal importation and reimportation of insulin and a final rule on the Importation of Prescription Drugs. Additionally, on November 27, 2020, the Canadian Minister of Health issued an interim order to ensure that participation in bulk importation frameworks, such as the one recently established by the U.S., does not cause or exacerbate a drug shortage in Canada. We continue to review these state proposals and legislation, as well as federal rules and guidance published by HHS and the FDA, the impact of which is uncertain at this time. Currently, it is unclear if the current presidential administration will adopt any of the importation initiatives put forth by the former presidential administration. We will continue to monitor and assess these developments.42In the private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare providers significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels, and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy, safety profile, or patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. Value-based agreements, where pricing is based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes, are another tool that may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. We expect these downward pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays. We continue to invest in patient affordability solutions (resulting in lower revenue) in an effort to assist patients in affording their medicines.The main coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are currently in effect through both state-based exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid. A trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly for pharmaceuticals. In addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. Federal legislation, litigation, or administrative actions to repeal or modify some or all of the provisions of the ACA could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards performance-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.InternationalInternational operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. Cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. Such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing, aging population and ongoing economic challenges. As additional reforms are finalized, we will assess their impact on future revenues. In addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. Given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded pharmaceutical products. The COVID-19 pandemic is also creating additional pressure on health systems worldwide. As a result, cost containment and other measures may intensify as governments manage and emerge from the pandemic. Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations could affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. Countries around the world, including the U.S., are actively considering and enacting tax law changes. The current presidential administration's tax proposal contains significant changes, including the rate at which income of U.S. companies would be taxed. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax policy in countries in which we operate. In addition, global tax authorities routinely examine our tax returns and are expected to become more aggressive in their examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions, which could affect our anticipated tax liabilities. 43AcquisitionsWe strategically invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including acquisitions, strategic alliances, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as an important way to achieve our strategies, as we seek to bolster our pipeline and enhance shareholder value. We continuously evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business.In 2019, we acquired all shares of Loxo for a purchase price of $6.92 billion, net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines, including selpercatinib, an oral RET inhibitor, and LOXO-305, an oral BTK inhibitor. In the second quarter of 2020, the FDA approved selpercatinib (Retevmo) under its Accelerated Approval regulations and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. In 2020, we acquired all shares of Dermira for a purchase price of $849.3 million, net of cash acquired. Under terms of the agreement, we acquired lebrikizumab, a novel, investigational, monoclonal antibody being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab was granted Fast Track designation from the FDA. We also acquired Qbrexza® cloth, a medicated cloth for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating).In January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail) for a purchase price of approximately $880 million in cash plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR). The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders to up to an additional approximately $160 million payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, or Spain. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired a biotechnology company developing potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.44Operating Results—2020 RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region:Year EndedDecember 31,20202019Percent ChangeU.S.$14,229.3 $12,722.6 12Outside U.S.10,310.5 9,596.8 7Revenue$24,539.8 $22,319.5 10Numbers may not add due to rounding.The following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year:2020 vs. 2019U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume17 %13 %15 %Price(5)%(6)%(5)%Foreign exchange rates— %— %— %Percent change12 %7 %10 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S., the revenue increase in 2020 was driven by increased volume primarily for Trulicity®, bamlanivimab, and Taltz®. Excluding bamlanivimab revenue, U.S. revenue grew 5 percent. The increase in revenue due to volume was partially offset by a decrease in realized prices. The decrease in realized prices in the U.S. was primarily driven by increased rebates to gain and maintain broad commercial access across the portfolio and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable segment mix and changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably impacting Humalog. The decrease in realized prices in the U.S. was partially offset by modest list price increases and lower utilization in the 340B segment. Outside the U.S., the revenue increase in 2020 was driven by increased volume primarily for Tyvyt, Trulicity, Alimta, and Olumiant. The increase in revenue due to volume was partially offset by lower realized prices primarily for Tyvyt and Alimta. The increase in volume and decrease in realized prices for Tyvyt and Alimta was driven primarily by their inclusion in government reimbursement programs in China. 45The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2020 compared with 2019:Year EndedDecember 31, 20202019ProductU.S.Outside U.S.TotalTotalPercent ChangeTrulicity$3,835.9 $1,232.2 $5,068.1 $4,127.8 23Humalog(1)1,485.6 1,140.3 2,625.9 2,820.7 (7)Alimta1,265.3 1,064.7 2,329.9 2,115.8 10Taltz1,288.5 500.0 1,788.5 1,366.4 31Humulin®866.4 393.2 1,259.6 1,290.1 (2)Jardiance(2)620.8 533.0 1,153.8 944.2 22Basaglar®842.3 282.1 1,124.4 1,112.6 1Forteo510.3 536.0 1,046.3 1,404.7 (26)Cyramza®381.9 650.8 1,032.6 925.1 12Verzenio618.2 294.4 912.7 579.7 57Bamlanivimab(3)850.0 21.2 871.2 — NMCymbalta42.1 725.6 767.7 725.4 6Olumiant63.8 575.0 638.9 426.9 50Cialis®61.8 545.4 607.1 890.5 (32)Erbitux®480.1 56.3 536.4 543.4 (1)Zyprexa®46.1 360.5 406.5 418.7 (3)Emgality®325.9 37.0 362.9 162.5 NMTrajenta®(4)95.6 263.0 358.5 590.6 (39)Other products548.7 1,099.8 1,648.8 1,874.4 (12)Revenue$14,229.3 $10,310.5 $24,539.8 $22,319.5 10Numbers may not add due to rounding.NM - Not meaningful(1) Humalog revenue includes insulin lispro.(2) Jardiance revenue includes Glyxambi®, Synjardy®, and Trijardy® XR.(3) Bamlanivimab sales are pursuant to EUA. (4) Trajenta revenue includes Jentadueto®.Revenue of Trulicity, a treatment for type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, increased 22 percent in the U.S., driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices primarily due to higher contracted rebates. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 27 percent, primarily driven by increased volume.Revenue of Humalog, an injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 11 percent in the U.S., driven by lower realized prices, partially offset by higher demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Included in the revenue of Humalog in the U.S. are our own insulin lispro authorized generics, which began launching in the second quarter of 2019 in order to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid severe decline in revenue. However, due to the impact of competition and due to pricing pressure in the U.S. and some international markets, we expect some price decline and loss of market share to continue over time.Revenue of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 4 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 19 percent, primarily driven by increased volume in China and Germany, partially offset by lower realized prices. We will lose our patent protection for Alimta in Japan and major European countries in June 2021. We expect the limited entry of generic competition in the U.S. starting February 2022 and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. We expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters"" for more information.46Revenue of Taltz, a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, increased 27 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 43 percent, primarily driven by increased volume. Revenue of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 2 percent in the U.S., driven by lower realized prices, partially offset by higher volume. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 4 percent, driven by decreased volume and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher realized prices.Revenue of Jardiance, a treatment for type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by increased volume. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 41 percent, driven primarily by increased volume. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Jardiance.Revenue of Basaglar, a long-acting human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 19 percent, driven primarily by increased volume. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Basaglar. A competitor launched a similar version of glargine in the U.S. in 2020. Due to the impact of competitive pressures, we expect some price decline and loss of market share over time. Revenue of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, decreased 21 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by decreased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 29 percent, driven by decreased volume and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. We expect further volume declines as a result of the anticipated entry of generic and biosimilar competition due to the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S., Japan, and major European markets. See ""Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for more information. Revenue of Cyramza, a treatment for various cancers, increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven primarily by increased volume. Revenue of Verzenio, a treatment for HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer, increased 36 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased $169.5 million driven by higher volume.Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of revenue was 77.7 percent in 2020, a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared with 2019, primarily due to the impact of lower realized prices on revenue, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, and higher intangibles amortization expense related to Retevmo, partially offset by charges in 2019 resulting from the withdrawal of Lartruvo® and greater manufacturing efficiencies. Gross margin percent for 2020 was also negatively impacted as a result of bamlanivimab sales in the fourth quarter of 2020. Research and development expenses increased 9 percent to $6.09 billion in 2020, driven primarily by approximately $450 million of development expenses for COVID-19 therapies. Excluding these expenses related to COVID-19 therapies, research and development expenses were relatively flat. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent to $6.12 billion in 2020 primarily due to lower marketing activity.We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $660.4 million in 2020 resulting from the acquisitions of Disarm and a pre-clinical stage company as well as collaborations with Innovent, Sitryx, Fochon, AbCellera, Evox, and Junshi Biosciences. In 2019, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $239.6 million resulting from collaborations with AC Immune, Centrexion, ImmuNext, and Avidity.47We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $131.2 million in 2020. The charges were primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure, as well as acquisition and integration costs incurred as part of the acquisition of Dermira. In 2019, we recognized $575.6 million of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges primarily associated with the accelerated vesting of Loxo employee equity awards as part of the acquisition of Loxo.Other—net, (income) expense was income of $1.17 billion in 2020 compared to income of $291.6 million in 2019 primarily driven by higher net gains on investment securities.Our effective tax rate was 14.3 percent in 2020, compared with an effective tax rate of 11.9 percent in 2019 driven by net discrete tax benefits in 2019. Operating Results—2019 For a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2019 and 2018 see Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.48FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include: •working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes;•capital expenditures;•share repurchases and dividends;•repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings; •contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans;•milestone and royalty payments; and•potential business development activities, including acquisitions, strategic alliances, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements.Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2020, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $3.66 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared with $2.34 billion at December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.50 billion in 2020, compared with $4.84 billion in 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 included approximately $360 million of cash paid to settle the accelerated vesting of Loxo employee equity awards (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $2.99 billion and $2.06 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.In February 2020, we completed our acquisition of Dermira for $18.75 per share, or approximately $1.1 billion, which was funded through cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. In February 2019, we completed our acquisition of Loxo for $235 per share or approximately $6.9 billion, which was funded through a mixture of cash and debt. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.As of December 31, 2020, total debt was $16.60 billion, an increase of $1.28 billion compared with $15.32 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase primarily related to the net proceeds from the issuance of $1.00 billion of 2.25 percent fixed-rate notes in May 2020, as well as the net proceeds from the issuance of an additional $250.0 million of 2.25 percent fixed-rate notes and the issuance of $850.0 million of 2.50 percent fixed-rate notes in August 2020. We used the net proceeds from the sale of these notes for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of outstanding commercial paper used to fund a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of Dermira. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $5.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $5.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund any short-term borrowing needs.For the 135th consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $2.96 per share and $2.58 per share were paid in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2020, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2021, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.85 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2021 of $3.40 per share.Capital expenditures of $1.39 billion during 2020, compared to $1.03 billion in 2019.49In 2020, we repurchased $500.0 million of shares under our $8.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in June 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.00 billion remaining under this program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.On March 11, 2019, we completed the disposition of our remaining 80.2 percent ownership of Elanco common stock through a tax-free exchange offer, which resulted in a reduction in shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 65 million as of that date.In January 2021, we completed our acquisition of Prevail for $22.50 per share, or approximately $880 million in cash, plus one non-tradable CVR that entitles Prevail stockholders to up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection.Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2020 and 2019, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro and the Japanese yen). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our carrying values of these investments were $2.04 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net, (income) expense by $407.6 million and $224.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 50We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Individually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.51APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback contracts in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing.Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.Financial Statement ImpactWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, a 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $313 million effect on our income before income taxes. The portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, and patient assistance programs:(Dollars in millions)20202019Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$4,635.5 $4,670.9 Reduction of net sales(1) 18,668.4 15,490.2 Cash payments(17,903.9)(15,525.6)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$5,400.0 $4,635.5 (1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 2 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.52Product Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesBackground and UncertaintiesProduct litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.AcquisitionsBackground and UncertaintiesTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue growth and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.53Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsBackground and UncertaintiesWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in “Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.Retirement Benefits AssumptionsBackground and UncertaintiesDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 65 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.Annually, we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 35 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively, alternative assets). We value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. Inputs include underlying net asset values, discounted cash flows valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks.54Financial Statement ImpactIf the 2020 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $21.6 million. If the 2020 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $28.8 million. If our assumption regarding the 2020 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $52.0 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 75 percent and 80 percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets, respectively, at December 31, 2020.Adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such changes are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.Income TaxesBackground and UncertaintiesWe prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based upon these interpretations. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which could result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from changes to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2020, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $83.4 million and $40.8 million, respectively.LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2021 For the full year of 2021, we expect EPS to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.75, which excludes estimated acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Prevail. We anticipate total revenue between $26.5 billion and $28.0 billion, including an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion of revenue from COVID-19 therapies. Revenue growth is expected to be driven by volume from Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Jardiance, Olumiant, Cyramza, Emgality, Tyvyt, and Retevmo, as well as by COVID-19 therapies. Revenue growth is expected to be partially offset by lower revenue for products that have lost patent exclusivity. We expect mid-single digit net price declines globally in 2021. In the U.S., we expect low-to-mid-single digit net price declines, driven primarily by increased rebates to maintain broad commercial access and segment mix, partially offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment. Outside the U.S., we expect net price declines in China, Japan, and Europe. 55We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 77 percent in 2021. Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, including approximately $300 million to $400 million of continued investment in COVID-19 therapies. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion. Other—net, (income) expense is expected to be expense in the range of $200 million to $300 million. The 2021 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 15 percent.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) at Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition and Liquidity.” That information is incorporated by reference herein.56",2023-12-30 16:23:05.822655

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Certain statements in this Item 7 constitute forward-looking statements. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" may cause our actual results, financial position, and cash generated from operations to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.Executive OverviewThis section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Earnings per share (EPS) data are presented on a diluted basis.COVID-19 PandemicIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on maintaining a supply of our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing treatments for COVID-19; protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting our communities; and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines, particularly insulin. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the request of the United States (U.S.) and international governments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and for baricitinib for treatment with or without remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In the third quarter of 2021, the FDA expanded the EUA for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to include post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited. In February 2022, the FDA granted an EUA for bebtelovimab for certain high-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We have agreed with the U.S. government to supply up to 600,000 doses of bebtelovimab no later than March 31, 2022 for at least $720 million with an option of 500,000 additional doses no later than July 31, 2022. The FDA has revised, and may in the future revise, any EUA for our COVID-19 therapies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our therapies have varying degrees of efficacy. The COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, adversely impact our business and operations. The focus of resources on COVID-19, widespread protective measures implemented to control the spread of COVID-19, and the resulting strain on global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets have negatively impacted development, manufacturing, supply, distribution, and sales of our medicines. In addition to decreases in new prescriptions, changes in payer segment mix, and the increased use of patient affordability programs in the U.S., we have experienced, and may continue to experience if the COVID-19 pandemic undergoes resurgent or more severe waves, decreased demand as a result of lack of ""normal"" access and fewer in-person interactions by patients and our employees with healthcare professionals. 34We also face risks and uncertainties related to our COVID-19 therapies, including heightened regulatory scrutiny of our manufacturing practices, quality assurance, and similar regulations, restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies, and risks related to handling, return, and/or refund of product after delivery by us. The availability of superior or competitive therapies, including therapies that can be administered more easily, or preventative measures such as vaccines, coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics, have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for our COVID-19 therapies. Mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus have in some cases impacted the effectiveness of our COVID-19 therapies, and may further render our therapies more or less effective or ineffective. The strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials resulting in changed buying patterns and constrained supply have had, and may continue to have, a number of impacts on our business, including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and potential disruptions in the supply of our medications. These factors may negatively affect our results of operations.It remains difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control. We are currently unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact our business and operations in the future.See Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" for additional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations.Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results:Year Ended December 31Percent Change20212020Revenue$28,318.4 $24,539.8 15Gross margin21,005.6 19,056.5 10Gross margin as a percent of revenue74.2 %77.7 %Operating expenses$13,457.5 $12,206.9 10Acquired in-process research and development 874.9 660.4 32Asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges316.1 131.2 NMOther—net, (income) expense 201.6 (1,171.9)NMIncome before income taxes6,155.5 7,229.9 (15)Income taxes573.8 1,036.2 (45)Net income5,581.7 6,193.7 (10)EPS6.12 6.79 (10)NM - not meaningfulRevenue increased in 2021 driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. Operating expenses, defined as the sum of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, increased in 2021, driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. The decreases in net income and EPS in 2021 were driven primarily by reduction in other-net, (income) expense and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross margin. 35The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2021 and 2020 financial results:2021Cost of Sales (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized a net inventory impairment charge related to our COVID-19 antibodies of $339.7 million. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the request of the U.S. and international governments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved during 2021, we incurred a net inventory impairment charge primarily due to the combination of changes to current and forecasted demand from U.S. and international governments, including changes to our agreement with the U.S. government, and near-term expiry dates of COVID-19 antibodies.Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $874.9 million related to business development transactions. Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $316.1 million primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo Oncology, Inc. (Loxo), an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza®, as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail). Other-Net, (Income) Expense (Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt. •We recognized $176.9 million of net investment gains on equity securities. 2020 Acquired IPR&D (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $660.4 million related to business development transactions. Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $131.2 million primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure.Other-Net, (Income) Expense (Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized $1.44 billion of net investment gains on equity securities. 36Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines. We currently have approximately 45 new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase.The following certain new molecular entities (NMEs) are currently in Phase II or Phase III clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review in the U.S., Europe, or Japan.

To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products and indications. 39We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines. A delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category. Other MattersPatent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. In 2021, our vitamin regimen patents for Alimta® expired worldwide. Following the loss of patent exclusivity in major European countries and Japan, we faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels. In the U.S., we expect pediatric data exclusivity to provide us with protection through May 2022. However, we and Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eagle) reached an agreement in December 2019 to settle all pending U.S. patent litigation, allowing Eagle a limited initial entry into the market with its product starting February 2022 (up to an approximate three-week supply) and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. We expect that the entry of generic competition in the U.S. following the loss of exclusivity will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue and will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed account of the legal proceedings currently pending regarding, among others, our Alimta patents.Our compound patent for Humalog® (insulin lispro) has expired in major markets. Global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of insulin lispro. A competitor has similar version of insulin lispro in the U.S. and in certain European markets. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue; however, we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that may continue over time.Our formulation and use patents for Forteo® have expired in major markets. We expect further decline in revenue as a result of the entry of generic and biosimilar competition due to the loss of patent exclusivity in major markets. Our regulatory data and patent exclusivity for Cymbalta® expired in Japan. Beginning in mid-2021, we have faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels.Foreign Currency Exchange RatesAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on operating expenses. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in these rates could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.40Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessGlobal concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate, as well as worldwide cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures may include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictive formularies, changes to available intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In addition, consolidation of private payors in the U.S. has significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, or private payers, such as the recently proposed Alzheimer’s Monoclonal Antibody national coverage determination, may adversely impact our business and financial results. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, such as insulin, as governments manage and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to our 340B program that, if resolved adversely to us, could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide. In addition, evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations and our industry, including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, and similar regulations, and increased focus on business combinations in our industry. Any regulatory issues concerning these matters could lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in the approvals of new products or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, impediments to the completion of business combinations, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our business.See Item 1, ""Business - Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access"" and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. In 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act), which contains a provision that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022. Previously, these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period.The U.S. and countries around the world are actively considering and enacting tax law changes. Tax proposals introduced by Congress and the U.S. presidential administration contain significant changes, including increases to the tax rates at which both domestic and foreign income of U.S. companies would be taxed. In addition, tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate.41AcquisitionsWe opportunistically invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business. In January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, or Spain. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition establishes a new modality for drug discovery and development, extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets. In February 2020, we acquired all shares of Dermira, Inc. for a purchase price of $849.3 million, net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired lebrikizumab, a novel, investigational, monoclonal antibody being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab was granted Fast Track designation from the FDA. We also acquired Qbrexza cloth, a medicated cloth for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating). In 2021, we sold the rights to Qbrexza. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of the rights to Qbrexza. In February 2019, we acquired all shares of Loxo for a purchase price of $6.92 billion, net of cash acquired. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired a pipeline of investigational medicines, including selpercatinib, an oral RET inhibitor, and LOXO-305 (pirtobrutinib), an oral BTK inhibitor. In the second quarter of 2020, the FDA approved selpercatinib (Retevmo) under its Accelerated Approval regulations and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our recent acquisitions.42Operating Results—2021 RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region:Year EndedDecember 31,20212020Percent ChangeU.S.$16,811.0 $14,229.3 18Outside U.S.11,507.4 10,310.5 12Revenue$28,318.4 $24,539.8 15The following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year:2021 vs. 2020U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume19 %13 %16 %Price(1)%(4)%(2)%Foreign exchange rates— %3 %1 %Percent change18 %12 %15 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S the increase in volume in 2021 was primarily driven by COVID-19 antibodies, Trulicity®, and Taltz®.Outside the U.S. the increase in volume in 2021 was primarily driven by Trulicity, Olumiant, COVID-19 antibodies, Verzenio, and Taltz. The decrease in realized prices outside the U.S. was primarily driven by the price impact of the updated National Reimbursement Drug List formulary for certain products, largely Tyvyt®, in China.43The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2021 compared with 2020:Year EndedDecember 31, 20212020ProductU.S.Outside U.S.TotalTotalPercent ChangeTrulicity$4,914.4 $1,557.6 $6,471.9 $5,068.1 28Humalog(1)1,320.7 1,132.3 2,453.0 2,625.9 (7)COVID-19 antibodies(2)1,978.0 261.4 2,239.3 871.2 NMTaltz1,542.4 670.4 2,212.8 1,788.5 24Alimta1,233.9 827.5 2,061.4 2,329.9 (12)Jardiance(3)807.3 683.5 1,490.8 1,153.8 29Verzenio834.9 515.0 1,349.9 912.7 48Humulin®832.9 389.6 1,222.6 1,259.6 (3)Olumiant(4)324.1 791.0 1,115.1 638.9 75Cyramza®358.1 674.8 1,033.0 1,032.6 —Basaglar®588.3 304.2 892.5 1,124.4 (21)Forteo441.6 360.3 801.9 1,046.3 (23)Cialis®10.6 707.9 718.4 607.1 18Cymbalta38.7 542.8 581.5 767.7 (24)Emgality®434.5 142.7 577.2 362.9 59Erbitux®481.8 66.4 548.3 536.4 2Zyprexa®39.6 390.7 430.3 406.5 6Tyvyt— 418.1 418.1 308.7 35Trajenta®(5)82.1 290.4 372.5 358.5 4Other products547.1 780.8 1,327.9 1,340.1 (1)Revenue$16,811.0 $11,507.4 $28,318.4 $24,539.8 15Numbers may not add due to rounding.NM - Not meaningful(1) Humalog revenue includes insulin lispro.(2) COVID-19 antibodies include sales for bamlanivimab administered alone as well as sales for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together and were made pursuant to EUAs or similar regulatory authorizations.(3) Jardiance revenue includes Glyxambi®, Synjardy®, and Trijardy® XR.(4) Olumiant revenue includes sales for baricitinib, for treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, that were made pursuant to EUA or similar regulatory authorizations.(5) Trajenta revenue includes Jentadueto®.Revenue of Trulicity, a treatment for type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, increased 28 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 26 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices.Revenue of Humalog, an injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 11 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by lower realized prices. Humalog's lower realized prices in the U.S. in 2021 were driven by higher contracted rebates and discounts and increased utilization in more highly-rebated government segments, partially offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by decreased volume and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices, largely offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Included in the revenue of Humalog in the U.S. are our own insulin lispro authorized generics. While it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro products entering the market, we do not expect and have not experienced a rapid and severe decline in revenue. However, due to the impact of competition and due to pricing pressure in the U.S. and some international markets, we expect some price decline and loss of market share to continue over time.44Revenue of COVID-19 antibodies, treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19 for higher-risk patients and for post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was $1.98 billion in the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenue outside the U.S. was $261.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The availability of superior or competitive therapies, including therapies that can be administered more easily, or preventative measures, such as vaccines, coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics, have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for these COVID-19 antibodies. The FDA has revised, and may in the future revise, any EUA for our COVID-19 antibodies in response to the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of efficacy. We expect that additional revenue from the sale of bamlanivimab and etesevimab after the first quarter of 2022 will be limited.Revenue of Taltz, a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, increased 20 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices due to increased rebates to gain commercial access. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 34 percent, primarily driven by increased volume. Revenue of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 2 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 22 percent, primarily driven by decreased volume due to the entry of generic competition in certain markets and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Following the loss of exclusivity in major European countries and Japan in June 2021, we faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition which has eroded revenue and is likely to continue to rapidly and severely erode revenue from current levels. In the U.S., we expect the limited entry of generic competition starting February 2022 and subsequent unlimited entry starting April 2022. We expect that the entry of generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue. See ""Executive Overview - Other Matters- Patent Matters"" for additional information. Revenue of Jardiance, a treatment for type 2 diabetes, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, increased 30 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 28 percent, primarily driven by increased volume. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Jardiance.Revenue of Verzenio, a treatment for HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer and high risk early breast cancer, increased 35 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 75 percent, driven by increased volume.Revenue of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by decreased volume, largely offset by higher realized prices and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Olumiant, a treatment for adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis, moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and of baricitinib, a treatment, with or without remdesivir, of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, increased $260.3 million in the U.S., driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 38 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. Increased volume worldwide was partially driven by utilization of Olumiant for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Revenue of Cyramza, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices. 45Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of revenue was 74.2 percent in 2021, a decrease of 3.5 percentage points compared with 2020, driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies. Research and development expenses increased 15 percent to $7.03 billion in 2021, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 5 percent to $6.43 billion in 2021, primarily due to increased marketing costs to continue to drive growth for certain products, investment in preparation for new launches, and lower marketing activities in 2020 as a result of pandemic-related spending reductions.We recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $874.9 million and $660.4 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to business development transactions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $316.1 million in 2021. The charges were primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo, an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza, as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail. In 2020, we recognized $131.2 million of asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges primarily related to severance costs incurred as a result of actions taken worldwide to reduce our cost structure. Other—net, (income) expense was expense of $201.6 million in 2021 compared to income of $1.17 billion in 2020, primarily driven by lower net investment gains on equity securities and a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt.Our effective tax rate was 9.3 percent in 2021, compared with an effective tax rate of 14.3 percent in 2020, primarily driven by the tax impacts of acquired IPR&D charges, lower net investment gains on equity securities, as well as a net discrete tax benefit. Operating Results—2020 For a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2020 and 2019 see Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.46FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include: •working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes;•capital expenditures;•share repurchases and dividends;•repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings; •contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans;•milestone and royalty payments; and•potential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements.Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues. Beginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters"" for additional information. We plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.Cash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021, compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.In January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 47As of December 31, 2021, total debt was $16.88 billion, an increase of $289.4 million compared with $16.60 billion at December 31, 2020. In September 2021, we issued euro-denominated notes consisting of €500.0 million of 1.125 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2051 and €700.0 million of 1.375 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2061, with interest to be paid annually, and British pound-denominated notes consisting of £250.0 million of 1.625 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2043, with interest to be paid annually. We paid $1.91 billion of the net cash proceeds from the offering to purchase and redeem certain higher interest rate U.S. dollar-denominated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.50 billion. We used the remaining net proceeds from the offering to prefund certain 2022 debt maturities and for general corporate purposes. In addition, in September 2021, we issued euro-denominated notes consisting of €600.0 million of 0.50 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2033, with interest to be paid annually. The net proceeds from the offering will be used to fund, in whole or in part, eligible projects designed to advance one or more of our environmental, social, and governance objectives. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $5.26 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $5.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund any short-term borrowing needs.For the 136th consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $3.40 per share and $2.96 per share were paid in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2021, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2022, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.98 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2022 of $3.92 per share.Capital expenditures of $1.31 billion during 2021, compared to $1.39 billion in 2020.In 2021, we repurchased $1.00 billion of shares, which completed our $8.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in June 2018. Additionally, our board authorized a $5.00 billion share repurchase program in May 2021. In 2021, we repurchased $250.0 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, we had $4.75 billion remaining under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.See ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection.Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels.In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of our total long-term debt carries interest at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 13 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2021 and 2020, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.48Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our carrying values of these investments were $1.83 billion and $2.04 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net, (income) expense by $365.6 million and $407.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Individually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.49APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing.Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.Financial Statement ImpactWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $366 million effect on our income before income taxes. The portion of our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs:(Dollars in millions)20212020Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$5,400.0 $4,635.5 Reduction of net sales(1) 20,106.3 18,668.4 Cash payments(19,344.7)(17,903.9)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$6,161.6 $5,400.0 (1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented.50Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesBackground and UncertaintiesLitigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, as applicable, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.AcquisitionsBackground and UncertaintiesTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue growth and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, probability of technical success and the discount rate.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2021, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of $3.5 million.51Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsBackground and UncertaintiesWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in ""Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.Retirement Benefits AssumptionsBackground and UncertaintiesDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 75 percent of which are growth investments), and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.Annually, we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 38 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively, alternative assets). We value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. Inputs include underlying net asset values, discounted cash flows valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks.52Financial Statement ImpactIf the 2021 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $21.6 million. If the 2021 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $31.5 million. If our assumption regarding the 2021 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $51.1 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 80 percent of each of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at December 31, 2021.Adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such changes are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.Income TaxesBackground and UncertaintiesWe prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based upon these interpretations. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities, which could result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from changes to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2021, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $84.9 million and $43.8 million, respectively.LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.53Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) at Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition and Liquidity.""

Financial ResultsThe following table summarizes our key operating results:Year Ended December 31Percent Change20222021Revenue$28,541.4 $28,318.4 1Gross margin21,911.6 21,005.6 4Gross margin as a percent of revenue76.8 %74.2 %Research and development$7,190.8 $6,930.7 4Marketing, selling, and administrative6,440.4 6,431.6 —Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) and development milestones908.5 970.1 (6)Asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges244.6 316.1 (23)Other—net, (income) expense 320.9 201.6 59Net income6,244.8 5,581.7 12Earnings per share - diluted6.90 6.12 13Revenue increased in 2022 driven by increased volume, largely offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Research and development expenses increased in 2022, driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses in 2022 remained relatively flat compared to 2021 as increased costs associated with launches of new products and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.37The following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2022 and 2021 financial results:2022Acquired IPR&D and Development Milestones (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized $908.5 million of acquired IPR&D and development milestones that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that were contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective PI3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a Priority Review Voucher. Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $244.6 million primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for GBA1 Gene Therapy (PR001) due to changes in estimated launch timing.Other-Net, (Income) Expense (Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized $410.7 million of net investment losses on equity securities. 2021 Cost of Sales (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized a net inventory impairment charge related to our COVID-19 antibodies of $339.7 million. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the request of the United States (U.S.) and international governments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved during 2021, we incurred a net inventory impairment charge primarily due to the combination of changes to demand from U.S. and international governments, including changes to our agreement with the U.S. government, and near-term expiry dates of COVID-19 antibodies.Acquired IPR&D and Development Milestones (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized $970.1 million of acquired IPR&D and development milestones that included charges resulting from business development transactions with Foghorn Therapeutics Inc. (Foghorn), Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Rigel), and Precision Biosciences, Inc. (Precision). Asset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized charges of $316.1 million primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo Oncology, Inc. (Loxo), an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza®, as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail). Other-Net, (Income) Expense (Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements)•We recognized a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt. •We recognized $176.9 million of net investment gains on equity securities.38Late-Stage PipelineOur long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines. We currently have approximately 45 new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase.The following certain new molecular entities (NMEs) are currently in Phase II or Phase III clinical trials or have been submitted for regulatory review or have received regulatory approval in the U.S., Europe, or Japan.

To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays, uncertainties, unpredictabilities, and inconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and indications. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines. A delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category. 41Other MattersPatent MattersWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. Following the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta® in Europe and Japan in June 2021, we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenues from current levels in these markets. In addition, as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity in the first half of 2022, we began facing, and expect to continue to face, generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current levels. This decline in revenue will continue to impact period-over-period financial results comparisons, particularly during the first half of 2023. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings currently pending regarding certain of our patents.Our compound patents for Humalog® (insulin lispro) have expired in the U.S. and major international markets, and we have also introduced lower-priced versions of Humalog as part of our insulin access and affordability solutions. A competitor has a similar version of insulin lispro in the U.S. and in certain European markets. Due to the impact of competition and pricing pressure in the U.S. and certain international markets, we expect that lower revenue for Humalog due to realized price decline will continue over time.Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and AccessReforms, including those that may stem from periods of economic downturn or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation, emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war), or government budgeting priorities (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic), may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.Global concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate and action, as well as worldwide cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictive formularies, changes to available intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA will require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices apply nine (medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or thirteen (medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) years following initial FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. It is too soon to tell how the U.S. government will set these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price, but not a minimum or floor price. One or more of our significant products may be selected, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to patent expiry. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. The establishment of payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would similarly impact us.Other IRA provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D medicines at a rate greater than the rate of inflation and Part D benefit redesign that includes replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant.The IRA takes effect progressively starting in 2023, with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. The IRA may meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a new drug application may reduce the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting are also uncertain. Provisions of the IRA may be subject to legal challenges or other reformation, and the full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. 42Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed and/or pursued by the U.S. Congress, the current U.S. presidential administration, and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. Consolidation and integration of private payors and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' national coverage determination for monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, may adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, such as insulin, as governments manage and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to our 340B program and access to insulin that, if resolved adversely to us, could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide. In addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our business. Moreover, increased focus on business combinations across industries and jurisdictions can lead to impediments to the completion of business combinations.See Item 1, ""Business—Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access"" and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Product SupplyWe have faced challenges, and expect to continue to face challenges, meeting strong demand for our incretin products, including due to the limited and fluctuating availability of competitor therapies. In the U.S., given very strong uptake of Mounjaro following its launch in the U.S. for type 2 diabetes in the second quarter of 2022, and as demand for Trulicity® has remained strong, we have experienced intermittent delays in fulfilling certain U.S. orders for these products. Outside the U.S., we have implemented certain actions to minimize the impact on existing Trulicity patients, but we expect to continue to experience intermittent disruptions in our supply of Trulicity in international markets. We anticipate tight supplies of our incretin products will persist until additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized. We expect additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity will become fully operational around the world in the next several years, with significant expansion in 2023, as part of our ongoing efforts to meet the significant demand for our incretin medicines.Tax MattersWe are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. In 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act), which contained a provision that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022. Previously, these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. The implementation of this provision increased our cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.20 billion in 2022. While the implementation of this provision will continue to increase our cash payments of income taxes, the increase will moderately decrease from 2022 levels over the five-year amortization period.43The U.S. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions. Changes to existing U.S. and foreign tax laws and increased scrutiny by tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Other ImpactsAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our consolidated results of operations in any given period. During the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue was unfavorably impacted by 3 percent due to foreign exchange rates. While there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in these rates have, and we currently expect in the near-term future will, adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.In addition, cost inflation, the strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest, including the Russia-Ukraine war), global economic downturns or uncertainty, and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had, and may continue to have, a number of impacts on our business, including increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines.AcquisitionsWe invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.COVID-19 PandemicAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, we remain focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting the medical system and our communities; and affordability of and access to our medicines. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also focused on researching, developing, and supplying COVID-19 therapies, although we do not currently expect significant further revenue attributable to treatments for COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations across markets to varying and fluctuating degrees, including as a result of cost inflation and strain on the global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets, fewer in-person interactions among patients and healthcare providers and our employees with healthcare professionals in certain markets, pricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems, and risks related to our COVID-19 therapies. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control. For additional information, see Item 1A, ""Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business—Public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our business and operations."" See Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" for additional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations.44RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOperating Results—2022 RevenueThe following table summarizes our revenue activity by region:Year Ended December 31,20222021Percent ChangeU.S.$18,190.0 $16,811.0 8Outside U.S.10,351.3 11,507.4 (10)Revenue$28,541.4 $28,318.4 1Numbers may not add due to rounding.The following are components of the change in revenue compared with the prior year:2022 vs. 2021U.S.Outside U.S.ConsolidatedVolume11 %9 %10 %Price(3)%(10)%(6)%Foreign exchange rates— %(8)%(3)%Percent change8 %(10)%1 %Numbers may not add due to rounding.In the U.S. the increase in volume in 2022 was primarily driven by Trulicity, Verzenio, Jardiance, Mounjaro, and Taltz®, partially offset by decreased volume for Alimta, following the entry of multiple generics in the first half of 2022. In the U.S. the decrease in realized prices was primarily driven by Humalog, due to a list price reduction of insulin lispro injection and unfavorable segment mix, and Trulicity and Basaglar®, due to unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. In addition, the decrease in realized prices of Humalog was partially offset by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in 2021.Outside the U.S. the increase in volume in 2022 was primarily driven by Verzenio, Trulicity, Jardiance, Tyvyt®, and Taltz, partially offset by a decrease in volume due to generic competition for Alimta and Cymbalta® and decreased utilization of COVID-19 antibodies. The decrease in realized prices outside the U.S. was primarily driven by the impact of government pricing in China from National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) formulary for certain products, particularly Tyvyt and Verzenio, and volume-based procurement (VBP) for Humalog. 45The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2022 compared with 2021:Year Ended December 31, 20222021Percent ChangeProductU.S.Outside U.S.TotalTotalTrulicity$5,688.8 $1,750.9 $7,439.7 $6,471.9 15Verzenio1,653.2 830.3 2,483.5 1,349.9 84Taltz1,724.6 757.4 2,482.0 2,212.8 12Jardiance(1)1,194.5 871.5 2,066.0 1,490.8 39Humalog(2)1,191.9 868.7 2,060.6 2,453.0 (16)COVID-19 antibodies(3)2,008.9 14.7 2,023.5 2,239.3 (10)Humulin®730.2 289.2 1,019.4 1,222.6 (17)Cyramza®351.4 620.0 971.4 1,033.0 (6)Alimta543.7 384.0 927.7 2,061.4 (55)Olumiant®(4)148.2 682.3 830.5 1,115.1 (26)Basaglar470.7 289.7 760.4 892.5 (15)Emgality®462.8 188.1 650.9 577.2 13Forteo®367.3 245.8 613.1 801.9 (24)Cialis®35.2 552.1 587.3 718.4 (18)Erbitux®500.1 66.4 566.5 548.3 3Mounjaro366.6 115.9 482.5 — NMZyprexa®30.4 306.5 336.9 430.3 (22)Tyvyt— 293.3 293.3 418.1 (30)Cymbalta33.7 249.6 283.3 581.5 (51)Other products687.8 974.9 1,662.9 1,700.4 (2)Revenue$18,190.0 $10,351.3 $28,541.4 $28,318.4 1Numbers may not add due to rounding.NM - Not meaningful(1) Jardiance revenue includes Glyxambi®, Synjardy®, and Trijardy® XR.(2) Humalog revenue includes insulin lispro.(3) COVID-19 antibodies include sales for bamlanivimab administered alone, for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together, and for bebtelovimab and were made pursuant to Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) or similar regulatory authorizations.(4) Olumiant revenue includes sales for baricitinib that were made pursuant to EUA or similar regulatory authorizations.Revenue of Trulicity increased 16 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices due to unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. We experienced intermittent delays in fulfilling certain U.S. Trulicity orders during the second half of 2022. Actions to manage strong demand across our incretin portfolio, including measures to minimize existing patient impact in international markets, also affected volume in 2022.Revenue of Verzenio increased 98 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 61 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices primarily due to the impact of the NRDL formulary in China and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Revenue of Taltz increased 12 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 13 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices. Revenue of Jardiance increased 48 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 28 percent, primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Jardiance.46Revenue of Humalog decreased 10 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by lower realized prices due to a list price reduction of insulin lispro injection and unfavorable segment mix, partially offset by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in 2021. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 23 percent, primarily driven by lower realized prices due to the impact of VBP in China and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Due to the impact of competition and pricing pressure in the U.S. and certain international markets, we expect that lower revenue for Humalog due to realized price decline will continue over time. See ""—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters"" for additional information. Revenue of COVID-19 antibodies was $2.01 billion in the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to bebtelovimab supplied to the U.S. government. COVID-19 antibodies are not currently authorized for emergency use in the U.S. We do not currently expect significant further revenue attributable to the treatment of COVID-19. Revenue of Alimta decreased 56 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by decreased demand due to the entry of multiple generics in the first half of 2022. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 54 percent, primarily driven by decreased demand due to generic competition. Following the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan in June 2021, we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenues from current levels in these markets. In addition, as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity in the first half of 2022, we began facing, and expect to continue to face, generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current levels. See ""—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters"" for additional information. 47Gross Margin, Costs, and ExpensesGross margin as a percent of revenue was 76.8 percent in 2022, an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with 2021, primarily driven by a net inventory impairment charge related to our COVID-19 antibodies recognized in 2021 and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold in 2021. Additionally, in 2022, favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, were offset by lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs. Research and development expenses increased 4 percent to $7.19 billion in 2022, driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $6.44 billion in 2022, as increased costs associated with launches of new products and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.We have undertaken compensatory actions to improve retention and address wage inflation, which will increase compensation costs and impact our consolidated results of operations. We recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $908.5 million in 2022 that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that were contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective PI3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a Priority Review Voucher. We recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $970.1 million in 2021 that included charges resulting from business development transactions with Foghorn, Rigel, and Precision. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $244.6 million in 2022, primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for GBA1 Gene Therapy (PR001) due to changes in estimated launch timing. We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $316.1 million in 2021, primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo, an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza, as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail.Other—net, (income) expense was expense of $320.9 million in 2022, primarily driven by net investment losses on equity securities. Other—net, (income) expense was expense of $201.6 million in 2021, primarily driven by a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt, partially offset by net investment gains on equity securities.Our effective tax rate was 8.3 percent in 2022, reflecting the favorable tax impact of the implementation of a provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022, partially offset by the tax impact of the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate was 9.3 percent in 2021, reflecting the favorable tax impacts of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, net investment gains on equity securities, and a net discrete tax benefit.Operating Results—2021 For a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2021 and 2020 see Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.48FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include: •working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes;•capital expenditures;•share repurchases and dividends;•repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings; •contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans;•milestone and royalty payments; and•potential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements.Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2022, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.In 2022, we committed to invest over several years more than $2 billion in two new facilities in Lebanon, Indiana to manufacture existing and future products, more than $1 billion in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices, and more than 400 million euro in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients. In early 2023, we committed to invest an additional $450 million to expand manufacturing capacity at Research Triangle Park facility in Durham, North Carolina for additional parenteral filling, device assembly, and packaging capacity. These investments, and other capital investments that support our operations, will result in higher capital expenditures for the next several years.The 2017 Tax Act contained a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. The implementation of this provision increased our cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.20 billion in 2022. While the implementation of this provision will continue to increase our cash payments of income taxes, the increase will moderately decrease from 2022 levels over the five-year amortization period. See ""—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Tax Matters"" for additional information.Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $2.07 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared with $3.82 billion at December 31, 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.08 billion in 2022, compared with $7.26 billion in 2021. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.05 billion and $3.30 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.In December 2022, we acquired all shares of Akouos, Inc. (Akouos) for a purchase price that included $12.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $327.2 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles Akouos shareholders up to an additional $3.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $122 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the achievement of certain specified milestones. This acquisition was funded through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 49As of December 31, 2022, total debt was $16.24 billion, a decrease of $646.1 million compared with $16.88 billion at December 31, 2021. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of $7.33 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $7.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.Dividends of $3.92 per share and $3.40 per share were paid in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The quarterly dividend was increased to $1.13 per share effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2023 of $4.52 per share.Capital expenditures were $1.85 billion during 2022, compared to $1.31 billion in 2021.In 2022, we repurchased $1.50 billion of shares under our $5.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in May 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had $3.25 billion remaining under this program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.See ""—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters"" for information regarding recent losses of patent protection.Both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of healthcare legislation; and various international government funding levels.In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations impact the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our total long-term debt carries interest at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 10 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2022 and 2021, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.Our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our carrying values of these investments were $1.16 billion and $1.83 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net, (income) expense by $232.4 million and $365.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 50We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Individually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.As we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our incretin products, we have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $4.5 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services over the durations of the agreements, which generally range from 2 to 8 years.51APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount AccrualsBackground and UncertaintiesWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing.Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.Financial Statement ImpactWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability would result in a change in revenue of approximately $464 million. The portion of our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs:(Dollars in millions)20222021Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year$6,161.6 $5,400.0 Reduction of net sales(1) 28,398.4 20,106.3 Cash payments(26,345.9)(19,344.7)Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year$8,214.1 $6,161.6 (1) Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented.Increase in reduction of net sales in 2022 was primarily driven by our incretin products due to increase in our patient assistance programs and in volume of rebates for managed care, Medicare and Medicaid programs.52Litigation Liabilities and Other ContingenciesBackground and UncertaintiesLitigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, as applicable, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.AcquisitionsBackground and UncertaintiesTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. If the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to acquired IPR&D and development milestones on our consolidated statement of operations at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue projections, and discount rate. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.The fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, probability of technical success and the discount rate.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liabilities would result in a change in income before income taxes of $5.5 million.53Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived AssetsBackground and UncertaintiesWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.Several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the ""income method,"" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.For acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in ""—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline."" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some acquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.Estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's judgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.Retirement Benefits AssumptionsBackground and UncertaintiesDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments), and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.Annually, we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 50 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively, alternative assets). We value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. Inputs include underlying net asset values, discounted cash flows valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks.54Financial Statement ImpactIf the 2022 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $23.8 million. If the 2022 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $33.5 million. If our assumption regarding the 2022 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $46.3 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 85 percent of each of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at December 31, 2022.Adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such changes are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.Income TaxesBackground and UncertaintiesWe file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates in our financial statements based upon these interpretations at the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities, which could result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties also exist in estimates of many tax positions due to the complexity of tax laws. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are both appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.Financial Statement ImpactAs of December 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $85.0 million and $38.8 million, respectively.LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) at Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis - Financial Condition and Liquidity.""

59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, significant business development, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved revenue growth of 7 percent in 2009, which was primarily driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, and Zyprexa and the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a result of the ImClone Systems Inc. (Imclone) acquisition in November 2008. The impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during the year decreased our cost of sales in 2009 and increased our cost of sales in 2008, which contributed to an improvement in gross margin. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue, while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than sales. We incurred income tax expense of $1.03 billion in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.2 percent. Earnings increased to $4.33 billion, and earnings per share increased to $3.94 per share, in 2009 as compared to a net loss of $2.07 billion, and a loss per share of $1.89 in 2008. Net income comparisons between 2009 and 2008 are affected by the impact of the following significant items: 2009 Acquisitions (Note 3) • We incurred acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges associated with an in-licensing arrangement with Incyte Corporation (Incyte) of $90.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.05. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 14) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $462.7 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.29 for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the sale of our Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site to an affiliate of Evonik Industries AG. • We incurred pretax charges of $230.0 million representing the currently probable and estimable exposures in connection with the claims of several states related to Zyprexa, which decreased earnings per share by $.13. 18 2008 Acquisitions (Note 3) • We recognized charges totaling $4.73 billion (pretax) associated with the acquisition of ImClone, which decreased earnings per share by $4.46. These amounts include an IPR&D charge of $4.69 billion (pretax). The remaining net expenses are related to ImClone’s operating results subsequent to the acquisition, incremental interest costs, and amortization of the intangible asset associated with Erbitux. We also incurred IPR&D charges of $28.0 million (pretax) associated with the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SGX), which decreased earnings per share by $.03. • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with licensing arrangements with BioMS Medical Corp. (BioMS) and TransPharma Medical Ltd. totaling $122.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.07. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 14) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges totaling $497.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.30. A similar charge of $57.1 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.04, was included in cost of sales. These charges were primarily associated with the sale of our Greenfield, Indiana site, the termination of the AIR® Insulin program; and strategic exit activities related to manufacturing operations. • We recorded charges of $1.48 billion (pretax) related to the federal and state Zyprexa investigations led by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA), as well as the resolution of a multi-state investigation regarding Zyprexa involving 32 states and the District of Columbia, which decreased earnings per share by $1.20. Other (Note 12) • We recognized a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million as a result of the resolution of a substantial portion of the IRS audit of our federal income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, which increased earnings per share by $.19. Late-Stage Pipeline Developments and Business Development Activity Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have over 60 potential new drugs in human testing. A number of late-stage pipeline developments and business development transactions occurred within the past year, including: Pipeline • The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an expanded indication for Byetta as a standalone medication (monotherapy) along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. • The FDA approved Zyprexa Relprevv for extended release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. We also launched this product under the tradename Zypadhera in several countries within the European Union. • We announced initial results from a Phase III clinical trial for arzoxifene. After reviewing the overall clinical profile of arzoxifene in light of currently available treatments, including our own osteoporosis products, we decided not to submit the compound for regulatory review. • The FDA approved a new use for Forteo to treat osteoporosis associated with sustained, systemic glucocorticoid therapy in men and women at high risk of fracture. • We and our partner BioMS discontinued Phase III clinical trials for dirucotide in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Data showed that dirucotide did not meet the primary endpoint of delaying disease progression and there were no statistically significant differences between dirucotide and placebo on the secondary endpoints of the study. • The FDA approved Effient tablets for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who are managed with an artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We and our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., launched Effient in the U.S. in August. The European Commission granted marketing authorization for Efient® for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with ACS undergoing PCI. • The FDA approved Alimta as a maintenance therapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically for patients with a nonsquamous histology whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. • The European Commission granted approval for the use of Alimta as monotherapy for maintenance treatment of patients with other than predominantly squamous cell histology in locally-advanced or 19 metastatic NSCLC, whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. • Alimta received regulatory approval in Japan as both a first- and second-line treatment of NSCLC. • We and our partners Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) and Alkermes, Inc., submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for exenatide once weekly. Exenatide once weekly is an investigational sustained release medication for type 2 diabetes that is injected subcutaneously and administered only once a week. • We began enrolling patients in two separate but identical Phase III clinical trials of solanezumab, an anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody being investigated as a potential treatment to delay the progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The trials each include a treatment period that lasts 18 months and are expected to enroll a total of 2,000 patients age 55 and over from 16 countries. • The FDA approved two new combination indications for Zyprexa (olanzapine) and fluoxetine for the acute treatment of bipolar depression and TRD in adults. • We received a complete response letter from the FDA for the first-line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Erbitux. Business Development • We entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Incyte for the development and commercialization of Incyte’s oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, and certain follow-on compounds, for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The lead compound is currently being studied in a six-month dose-ranging Phase II trial for rheumatoid arthritis. • We entered into a co-promotion agreement with Kowa Pharmaceutical America to commercialize Livalo® (pitavastatin) in the United States. Lilly and Kowa Company, Limited have also entered into a licensing agreement in Latin America. Livalo is a statin approved by the FDA in August 2009 for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. We plan to launch Livalo in the U.S. in mid-2010. • In January 2010, we restructured the collaboration agreement executed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone in 2001 to allow for the co-development and co-commercialization of the late-stage oncology molecule necitumumab (IMC-11F8), which is currently in Phase III clinical testing for non-small cell lung cancer. Under the restructured agreement, both companies will share in the cost of developing and potentially commercializing necitumumab in the U.S., Canada and Japan. We maintain exclusive rights to necitumumab in all other markets. Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters In September 2009, we set a goal to reduce our expected cost structure by $1 billion by the end of 2011. We also plan to lower global headcount to 35,000 by the end of 2011, excluding strategic sales force additions in high-growth emerging markets and Japan, which could result in future periodic restructuring charges. In January 2009, we reached resolution with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA, and the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of 36 states and the District of Columbia, of an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. We recorded a charge of $1.42 billion for this matter in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, we paid substantially all of this amount, as required by the settlement agreements. In addition, in October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws, under which we paid $62.0 million. However, we were served with lawsuits brought by attorneys general of a number of states, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug and seeking to recover the costs paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs alleged to have been incurred and that will be incurred to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. In 2009, we incurred pretax charges of $230.0 million, reflecting the probable and estimable exposures in connection with these claims. We have reached settlements or are in advanced discussions to settle all of the remaining state claims. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial in April 2010 in state court. Health care reform is currently the subject of intense debate in the U.S. Congress. The impact of reform on the pharmaceutical industry is uncertain. Most reform proposals intend to provide coverage for the uninsured, include increasing existing price rebates in federally funded health care programs and the expansion of rebates, or other pharmaceutical company discounts, into new programs. There are also proposals that will impose new fees on pharmaceutical industry sales of certain prescription pharmaceutical products. Certain federal and state health care reform proposals that go beyond providing additional health insurance coverage for the uninsured may also place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices. These proposals include reducing incentives for employer-sponsored health care; 20 the creation of an independent commission to propose changes to Medicare, with a particular focus on the cost of biopharmaceuticals in Medicare Part D, which lowers the projections for future government spending in Medicare; and a government-run public option with biopharmaceutical price-setting capabilities. Additionally, various proposals could legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow, or require, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices within Medicare Part D directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, the federal government is considering creating an expedited regulatory approval pathway for biosimilars (copies of biological compounds) for biologic products in the U.S.; the proposals vary as to which biologic products would be eligible, how quickly a biosimilar might reach the market, and the ability to interchange the biosimilar and the original biologic product at the pharmacy. We expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to become more severe, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. In its budget submission to Congress in February 2010, the Obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S.-based companies. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address this issue, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of discussion for the U.S. Congress. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls, limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. These proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact, given the effect of the downturn in the global economy on local governments. OPERATING RESULTS—2009 Revenue Our worldwide revenue for 2009 increased 7 percent, to $21.84 billion, driven primarily by growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, and Zyprexa, and the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a result of the ImClone acquisition. Worldwide sales volume increased 7 percent, while selling prices contributed 3 percent of revenue growth, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 3 percent. Revenue in the U.S. increased 12 percent, to $12.29 billion, due to higher prices and higher demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, to $9.54 billion, due to increased demand, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices. The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2009 compared with 2008: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total3 Total from 2008 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,331.7 $ 2,583.9 $ 4,915.7 $ 4,696.1 5 Cymbalta 2,551.8 523.0 3,074.7 2,697.1 14 Humalog 1,208.4 750.6 1,959.0 1,735.8 13 Alimta 815.6 890.4 1,706.0 1,154.7 48 Cialis 623.3 935.8 1,559.1 1,444.5 8 Gemzar 747.4 615.8 1,363.2 1,719.8 (21 ) Animal health products 672.2 535.0 1,207.2 1,093.3 10 Evista 682.2 348.1 1,030.4 1,075.6 (4 ) Humulin 402.4 619.6 1,022.0 1,063.2 (4 ) Forteo 518.3 298.4 816.7 778.7 5 Strattera 445.6 163.7 609.4 579.5 5 Other pharmaceutical products 739.9 1,168.4 1,908.1 1,887.5 1 Total net product sales 11,738.8 9,432.7 21,171.5 19,925.8 6 Collaboration and other revenue2 555.6 108.9 664.5 446.1 49 Total revenue $ 12,294.4 $ 9,541.6 $ 21,836.0 $ 20,371.9 7 1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico. 2 Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of Erbitux royalties and 50 percent of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S. 3 Numbers may not add due to rounding. 21 Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2009, due to higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the U.S. was favorably impacted by the withdrawal of generic competition in Germany in early 2009. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, increased 13 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 18 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices. Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 20 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, increased demand, and wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 45 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the U.S. benefited from the addition of the non-small cell lung cancer indication in Japan. Our sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction, increased 16 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, increased demand, and wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent, higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to treat various cancers, increased 2 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 37 percent, driven by reduced demand and lower prices as a result of the entry of generic competition in most major markets, and to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, decreased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by reduced demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 7 percent, driven by the outlicensing of Evista in most European markets and, to a lesser extent, lower prices. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 6 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 9 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by increased demand. Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture, increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by increased demand and prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, increased 2 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 15 percent, driven by increased demand and higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Worldwide sales of Byetta, an injectable product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, increased 6 percent to $796.5 million during 2009. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S., 100 percent of Byetta sales outside the U.S., and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Our revenues increased 13 percent to $448.5 million in 2009. We report as revenue for Erbitux, a product approved to treat various cancers, the net royalties received from our collaboration partners and our product sales. Our revenues were $390.8 million in 2009, compared with $29.4 million in 2008. We acquired Erbitux as part of our acquisition of ImClone in November 2008. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 25 percent, primarily driven by the inclusion of Posilac sales following the acquisition completed October 2008. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 4 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2009 gross margin increased to 80.6 percent of total revenue compared with 78.5 percent for 2008. This increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on 22 international inventories sold during the year, which decreased cost of sales as in 2009, but increased cost of sales in 2008. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 4 percent in 2009 to $6.89 billion. The increase was driven by the increased marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S., higher incentive compensation, and the impact of the ImClone acquisition, partially offset by the movement of foreign exchange rates. Investment in research and development increased 13 percent, to $4.33 billion, due primarily to the ImClone acquisition and increased late-stage clinical trial costs. We incurred an IPR&D charge of $90.0 million in 2009, associated with the in-licensing agreement with Incyte, compared with $4.84 billion in 2008. The 2008 IPR&D charge included $4.69 billion resulting from the acquisition of ImClone. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $692.7 million in 2009, primarily related to asset impairment charges related to the sale of our Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site and special charges related to Zyprexa litigation with multiple state attorneys general, compared with $1.97 billion in 2008. The 2008 charges were primarily associated with the resolution of Zyprexa investigations with the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA and multiple states. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other—net, expense, (income) was a net expense in both years, increasing by $203.4 million, to $229.5 million in 2009, primarily due to lower interest income and higher interest expense resulting from the ImClone acquisition. We incurred income tax expense of $1.03 billion in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.2 percent. The effective tax rate for 2009 was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the Tippecanoe site. We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net loss was driven by the $4.69 billion IPR&D charge for ImClone and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa investigation settlements. The IPR&D charge was not tax deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of a substantial portion of the 2001-2004 IRS audit. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. OPERATING RESULTS—2008 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 9 percent, which was primarily driven by volume increases in several key products. The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales contributed to an improvement in gross margin. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew at the same rate as sales, driven by pre-launch activities associated with Effient, marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista, the impact of foreign exchange rates, and increased litigation-related expenses, while our investment in research and development grew 10 percent. We completed our acquisition of ImClone, resulting in a significant charge of $4.69 billion for IPR&D and reached resolution on government investigations related to our past U.S. marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa, resulting in an additional charge of $1.48 billion. We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million, despite a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion, primarily caused by the non-deductibility of the ImClone IPR&D charge and the partial deductibility of the Zyprexa investigation settlements. Accordingly, earnings decreased to a net loss of $2.07 billion, and earnings per share decreased to a loss of $1.89 per share, in 2008 as compared with net income of $2.95 billion, and earnings per share of $2.71, in 2007. Net income comparisons between 2008 and 2007 are affected by the impact of several significant items. The significant items for 2008 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2007 items are summarized as follows: Acquisitions (Note 3) • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with the acquisitions of ICOS Corporation (ICOS), Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), and Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), totaling $631.6 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.57. • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with our licensing arrangements with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India, MacroGenics, Inc., and OSI Pharmaceuticals, totaling $114.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.06. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 14) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $190.6 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.12. These charges were primarily associated with previously announced strategic decisions affecting manufacturing and research facilities. • We incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of our insurance carriers over Zyprexa product liability claims, which led to a reduction of our expected product liability insurance recoveries, and other product liability charges. This resulted in a charge totaling $111.9 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.09. 23 Revenue Our worldwide revenue for 2008 increased 9 percent, to $20.37 billion, driven primarily by growth of Cymbalta, Cialis, Alimta, Humalog, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales volume increased 5 percent, while foreign exchange rates contributed 3 percent, and selling prices contributed 2 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Revenue in the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $10.93 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, and Alimta. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $9.44 billion, driven primarily by revenue growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, and Humalog. The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2008 compared with 2007: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2007 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,202.5 $ 2,493.6 $ 4,696.1 $ 4,761.0 (1 ) Cymbalta 2,253.8 443.3 2,697.1 2,102.9 28 Humalog 1,008.4 727.4 1,735.8 1,474.6 18 Gemzar 734.8 985.0 1,719.8 1,592.4 8 Cialis2 539.0 905.5 1,444.5 1,143.8 26 Alimta 561.9 592.8 1,154.7 854.0 35 Animal health products 537.3 556.0 1,093.3 995.8 10 Evista 700.5 375.1 1,075.6 1,090.7 (1 ) Humulin 380.9 682.3 1,063.2 985.2 8 Forteo 489.9 288.8 778.7 709.3 10 Strattera 437.8 141.7 579.5 569.4 2 Other pharmaceutical products 664.8 1,222.7 1,887.5 1,895.6 — Total net product sales 10,511.6 9,414.2 19,925.8 18,174.7 10 Collaboration and other revenue3 418.5 27.6 446.1 458.8 (3 ) Total revenue $ 10,930.1 $ 9,441.8 $ 20,371.9 $ 18,633.5 9 1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico. 2 Prior to the acquisition of ICOS in late January 2007, the Cialis revenue shown does not include net product sales in the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory net product sales for January 2007, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other—net, expense (income) in our consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the acquisition, all Cialis net product sales are reported in our net revenue. Worldwide 2008 revenue for Cialis grew 19 percent from 2007 revenue of $1.22 billion. 3 Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of 50 percent of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 1 percent in 2008, driven by reduced demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by decreased demand and, to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic competition in Germany and Canada. Sales of Cymbalta increased 23 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 66 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices. Higher demand outside the U.S. reflects increased demand in established markets as well as recent launches in new markets. Sales of Humalog increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 24 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Gemzar increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Cialis increased 27 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 26 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices. Total worldwide sales of Cialis increased 19 percent 24 to $1.44 billion in 2008 as compared to $1.22 billion in 2007. This includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly ICOS joint-venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the acquisition of ICOS. Sales of Alimta increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 46 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by reduced demand and lower prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Humulin increased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Sales of Forteo decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 34 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Strattera decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 35 percent, driven primarily by increased demand. Worldwide sales of Byetta increased 16 percent to $751.4 million during 2008. Our revenues increased 20 percent to $396.1 million in 2008. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by the inclusion of U.S. Posilac sales since the date of acquisition. Sales outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2008 gross margin increased to 78.5 percent of total revenue compared with 77.2 percent for 2007. This increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2008, to $6.63 billion. This increase was due to increased marketing and selling expenses, including prelaunch expenses for Effient and marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista; the impact of foreign exchange rates; and increased litigation-related expenses. Investment in research and development increased 10 percent, to $3.84 billion, due to increased late-stage clinical trial and discovery research costs. Acquired IPR&D charges related to the acquisitions of ImClone and SGX, as well as our in-licensing arrangements with BioMS and TransPharma, were $4.84 billion in 2008 as compared to $745.6 million in 2007. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $1.97 billion in 2008, as compared to $302.5 million in 2007. The 2008 charges were primarily associated with the resolution of Zyprexa investigations with the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA and multiple states. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other—net, expense (income) changed from net income of $122.0 million in 2007 to net expense of $26.1 million in 2008, primarily as a result of lower outlicensing income and increased net losses on investment securities in 2008 (the majority of which consisted of unrealized losses). We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net loss was driven by the $4.69 billion acquired IPR&D charge for ImClone and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa investigation settlements. The IPR&D charge was not tax deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of a substantial portion of the 2001-2004 IRS audit. The effective tax rate was 23.8 percent in 2007. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $4.50 billion compared with $5.93 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease in cash was driven by a reduction in short-term borrowings of $5.82 billion and dividends paid of $2.15 billion, partially offset by cash from operations of $4.34 billion (which included payments related to the Zyprexa EDPA settlement of $1.39 billion) and proceeds of long-term debt issuances of $2.40 billion. Capital expenditures of $765.0 million during 2009 were $182.2 million less than in 2008. We expect 2010 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.0 billion as we invest in our biotechnology capabilities, continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems, and invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes care products. Total debt at December 31, 2009, was $6.66 billion, a decrease of $3.80 billion from December 31, 2008 reflecting the pay-down of our commercial paper that was issued to finance our acquisition of ImClone, partially offset by $2.40 billion of long-term debt we issued in March 2009. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s remain at AA and A1, respectively. 25 Dividends of $1.96 per share were paid in 2009, an increase of 4 percent from 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2009, effective for the first-quarter dividend in 2010, the quarterly dividend was maintained at $.49 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2010 of $1.96 per share. The year 2009 was the 125th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments. Despite increasing unemployment and declines in real consumer spending, consumer confidence has grown and job losses have slowed during the second half of 2009. Many financial institutions continue to have tightened lines of credit, thus reducing funding available to stimulate near-term economic growth. While there are some positive signs, the prospects for recovery are uncertain. Pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally been relatively unaffected by economic downturns; however, an extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall prescriptions corresponding to the growth of the uninsured and underinsured population in the U.S. In addition, both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care, including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs. We continue to monitor the potential near-term impact of prescription trends, the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers, the evolving health care debate, the federal government’s involvement in the economic crisis, and various international government funding levels. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, costs associated with litigation and government investigations, and dividends in 2010. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowings. Our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the illiquidity in the markets because of the high credit quality of our short- and long-term debt. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program and matures in May 2011. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. In the next three years we will lose effective exclusivity for Zyprexa in major European countries (September 2011) and the U.S. (October 2011); and for Humalog in major European countries (November 2010). Gemzar has already lost effective exclusivity in major European countries. In addition, we face U.S. patent litigation over several key patent-protected products whose exclusivity extends beyond 2012, including Alimta, Cymbalta, Evista, Gemzar, and Strattera and it is possible we could face an unexpected loss of our effective exclusivity for one or more of these products prior to the end of 2012. Revenue from each of these products contributes materially to our results of operations, liquidity, and financial position, and the loss of exclusivity could result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product. However, we plan to mitigate the effect on our operations, liquidity and financial position through growth in our remaining business and the previously announced plan to reduce our expected cost structure by $1 billion by the end of 2011. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2009 and 2008, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, 26 respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt, including interest payments1 $ 10,519.8 $ 243.4 $ 2,093.4 $ 1,563.7 $ 6,619.3 Capital lease obligations 39.2 13.5 13.3 9.0 3.4 Operating leases 403.4 109.1 156.1 78.3 59.9 Purchase obligations2 11,367.1 7,259.9 1,599.6 1,471.5 1,036.1 Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 1,136.9 — 298.6 195.0 643.3 Other4 198.8 198.8 — — — Total $ 23,665.2 $ 7,824.7 $ 4,161.0 $ 3,317.5 $ 8,362.0 1 Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2009 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: • Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2009. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. • Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $1,088.4 million, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities. 4 This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. 27 The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2009. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than 85 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales, which are outside the U.S., are recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns. We establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Consistent with Revenue Recognition accounting guidance, we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. Actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term-care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these 28 rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. U.S. sales returns, federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid) and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $1.20 billion, $1.03 billion, and $738.8 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. A 5 percent change in the sales return, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2009 would lead to an approximate $60 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2009, our sales returns, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate liability was $692.3 million. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Approximately 84 percent and 80 percent of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. returns, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2009 2008 Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $ 806.5 $ 693.5 Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates1 2,233.8 1,864.9 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (2,076.7 ) (1,751.9 ) Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $ 963.6 $ 806.5 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 0.1 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. In the past few years, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend 29 rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 88 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company-specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2009 annual expense would increase by $18.9 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2009 service cost and interest cost by $15.8 million. If the 2009 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $23.6 million. If the 2009 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $16.8 million. If our assumption regarding the 2009 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $27.7 million. The U.S. plans represent approximately 82 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 83 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2009. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $41.8 million and $41.8 million, respectively. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2010 For the full year of 2010, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.85, excluding the potential impact of health care reform in the U.S. and restructuring charges resulting from previously announced strategic headcount reductions. We expect volume-driven revenue growth in the high-single digits, driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Effient and the exenatide franchise. We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be flat to declining. Marketing, selling, and 30 administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits while research and development expenses are projected to grow in the low-double digits. Other—net, expense (income) is expected to be a net expense of between $150.0 million and $200.0 million. Cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion, anticipated business development activity, and our dividend. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by us, including those above, are based on management’s belief at the time they are made. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in-process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions; changes in effective tax rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, patent disputes, and government investigations; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, as well as proposed health care reform currently being discussed by the U.S. Congress. We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): • Cymbalta: Sixteen generic drug manufacturers have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic versions of Cymbalta prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (the earliest of which expires in 2013). Of these challengers, all allege non-infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial formulation, and nine allege invalidity of the patent claims directed to the active ingredient duloxetine. Of the nine challengers to the compound patent claims, one further alleges invalidity of the claims directed to the use of Cymbalta for treating fibromyalgia, and one alleges the patent having claims directed to the active ingredient is unenforceable. In November 2008 we filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Actavis Elizabeth LLC; Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.; Cobalt Laboratories, Inc.; Impax Laboratories, Inc.; Lupin Limited; Sandoz Inc.; and Wockhardt Limited, seeking rulings that the patents are valid, infringed, and enforceable. We filed similar lawsuits in the same court against Sun Pharma Global, Inc. in December 2008 and against Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in August 2009. The cases have been consolidated and actions against all but Wockhardt Limited have been stayed pursuant to stipulations by the defendants to be bound by the outcome of the litigation through appeal. • Gemzar: Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc., now Hospira, Inc. (Hospira); Fresenius Kabi Oncology Plc (Fresenius); Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., now Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva); and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and method-of-use patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these patents are invalid. Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) and APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP) have similarly challenged our method-of-use patent. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Teva (February 2006), Hospira (October 2006 and January 2008), Sandoz (October 2009), APP (December 2009), and Fresenius (February 2010), seeking rulings that our patents are valid and are being infringed. Sandoz withdrew its ANDA and the suit against it was dismissed in February 2010. The trial against Teva was held in September 2009 and we are waiting for a ruling. Teva’s ANDAs have been approved by the FDA; however, Teva must provide 90 days notice prior to marketing generic Gemzar to allow time for us to seek a preliminary injunction. Both suits against Hospira have been administratively closed, and the parties have agreed to be bound by the results of the Teva suit. In November 2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking rulings that our method-of-use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by the sale of Sun’s generic product. In August 2009, the District Court granted a motion by Sun for partial summary judgment, invalidating our method-of-use patent. We have appealed this decision. This ruling has no bearing on the compound patent. The trial originally scheduled for December 2009 has been postponed while the court considers Sun’s second summary judgment motion, related to the validity of our compound patent. 31 Sun and APP have received tentative approval for their products from the FDA, but are prohibited from entering the market by 30-month stays, which expire in June 2010 for Sun and May 2012 for APP. • Alimta: Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva), APP, and Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) each submitted ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant U.S. patent (licensed from the Trustees of Princeton University and expiring in 2016), and alleging the patent is invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Teva, APP, and Barr seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed. Trial is scheduled for November 2010 against Teva and APP. • Evista: In 2006, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2012-2017) and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or not infringed. In June 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Teva. The trial against Teva was completed in March 2009. In September 2009, the court upheld our method-of-use patents (the last expires in 2014). Teva has appealed that ruling. In addition, the court held that our particle-size patent (expiring 2017) is invalid. We have appealed that ruling. • Strattera: Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis), Apotex Inc. (Apotex), Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun), and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patent (expiring in 2017), and alleging that this patent is invalid. In 2007, we brought a lawsuit against Actavis, Apotex, Aurobindo, Mylan, Sandoz, Sun, and Teva in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The court has ruled on all pending summary judgment motions, and granted our infringement motion. The remaining invalidity defenses will be decided at trial, which could take place as early as the third quarter of 2010. Several companies have received tentative approval to market generic atomoxetine, but are prohibited from entering the market by a 30-month stay which expires in November 2010. We believe each of these Hatch-Waxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the U.S.: • In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011). In April 2007, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in February 2008. In June 2007, the Canadian Federal Court held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter of 2007. In September 2009, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against us in the Novapharm suit, finding our patent invalid. We have appealed this decision. If the decision is upheld, we could face liability for damages related to delays in the launch of generic olanzapine products; however, we have concluded at this time that the damages are not probable or estimable. • In Germany, the German Federal Supreme Court upheld the validity of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011) in December 2008, reversing an earlier decision of the Federal Patent Court. Following the decision of the Supreme Court, the generic companies who launched generic olanzapine based on the earlier decision either agreed to withdraw from the market or were subject to injunction. We are pursuing these companies for damages arising from infringement. • We have received challenges in a number of other countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and several smaller European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers’ challenges, but additional actions are now pending. In the U.K., the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Limited (Dr. Reddy’s) has challenged the validity of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011). In October 2008, the Patents Court in the High Court, London ruled that our patent was valid. Dr. Reddy’s appealed this decision. The U.K. Court of Appeal affirmed the validity of the patent in December 2009. Dr. Reddy’s did not seek further appeal to the U.K. Supreme Court, therefore the U.K. proceedings are concluded. We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our Zyprexa patents on a country-by-country basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. Xigris and Evista: In June 2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ariad), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows of Harvard 32 College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products. Following jury and bench trials on separate issues, the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts entered final judgment in September 2007 that Ariad’s claims were valid, infringed, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65 million plus a 2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal are exhausted. In April 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the District Court judgment, concluding that Ariad’s asserted patent claims are invalid. In August 2009, the Court of Appeals agreed to review this decision en banc, thereby vacating the Court of Appeals decision. The en banc hearing occurred in December 2009 and we are awaiting a decision. Nevertheless, we believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote. Zyprexa Litigation We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the U.S. and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 32,670 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows: • In 2005, we settled and paid more than 8,000 claims for $690.0 million, plus $10.0 million to cover administration of the settlement. • In 2007, we settled and paid more than 18,000 claims for approximately $500 million. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 170 lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 260 plaintiffs, of which about 140 cases covering about 150 plaintiffs are part of the MDL. The MDL cases have been scheduled for trial in groups, and no specific trial dates for trial groups have been assigned. We also have trials scheduled in Texas state court in May and August 2010 and in Ohio in August 2010. In January 2009, we reached resolution with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA), and the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of 36 states and the District of Columbia, of an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. As part of the resolution, we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the off-label promotion of Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, between September 1999 and March 2001. We recorded a charge of $1.42 billion for this matter in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, we paid substantially all of this amount, as required by the settlement agreements. As part of the settlement, we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years. The agreement also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on the company’s systems, processes, policies, procedures, and practices. In October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws. While there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted, we accrued and paid $62.0 million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years, through consent decrees filed with the settling states. We have been served with lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These suits seek to recover the costs paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs alleged to have been incurred and that will be incurred by the states to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. The Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings in the EDNY. 33 The Alaska case was settled in March 2008 for a payment of $15.0 million, plus terms designed to ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims. We are in advanced discussions with the attorneys general for several of these states, seeking to resolve their Zyprexa-related claims, and we have agreed to settlements with the states of Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia. In the second and third quarters of 2009, we incurred pretax charges of $105.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively, reflecting the currently probable and estimable exposures in connection with these claims. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial in April 2010 in state court. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September 2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinstein’s order denying our motion for summary judgment, in September 2008. While the Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on the appeal in December 2009, no opinions have been rendered. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. In December 2009, the court granted our summary judgment motion, dismissing the case. Plaintiffs have appealed this decision. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes all Canadian residents except for residents of Quebec and British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the product liability litigation pending in the U.S. We are in advanced discussions to resolve all Zyprexa class-action litigation in Canada. We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Other Product Liability Litigation We have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES), thimerosal, and Byetta. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Product Liability Insurance Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past several years, we have been unable to attain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future.

59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Executive Overview This section provides an overview of our financial results, product launches and late-stage product pipeline developments, and legal and governmental matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 6 percent, due in part to the launch in 2004 of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets. In addition, we launched one new product in the U.S. and several new products, new indications, or new formulations in key markets in 2005. We continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities, resulting in cost of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales. Despite product launch expenditures, our cost-containment and productivity measures 18 Table of Contents contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate less than sales. During 2005, we began to expense stock options, which had the effect of increasing our research and development and marketing and administrative expenses. We also benefited from an increase in net other income due primarily to increased profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint venture and a decrease in the tax rate in 2005. Net income was $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005 as compared with $1.81 billion, or $1.66 per share, in 2004, representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 9 percent. Net income comparisons between 2005 and 2004 are also affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results (see Notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): 2005 • We incurred a charge related to product liability litigation matters, primarily related to Zyprexa®, of $1.07 billion (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.90 in the second quarter of 2005 (Notes 4 and 13). • In 2005, we began to expense stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Had we expensed stock options in 2004, our 2004 net income would have been lower by $266.4 million, which would have decreased earnings per share by $.24 per share (Notes 1 and 7). • We recognized asset impairment and other special charges of $171.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.14 (Note 4). • We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $22.0 million (after-tax), which decreased earnings per share by $.02 (Note 2). 19 Table of Contents 2004 • We recognized asset impairment charges, streamlined our infrastructure, and provided for the anticipated resolution of the government investigation of Evista® marketing and promotional practices, resulting in charges of $108.9 million (pretax) in the second quarter and $494.1 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.08 and $.30, respectively (Note 4). • We incurred charges for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $362.3 million (no tax benefit) in the first quarter related to the acquisition of Applied Molecular Evolution, Inc. (AME), and $29.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter related to our acquisition of a Phase I compound currently under development as a potential treatment for insomnia, which decreased earnings per share by $.33 in the first quarter and $.02 in the fourth quarter (Note 3). • As discussed further in Financial Condition, we recognized tax expenses of $465.0 million in the fourth quarter associated with the anticipated repatriation in 2005 of $8.00 billion of our earnings reinvested outside the U.S., as a result of the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). This tax expense decreased earnings per share by $.43 in that quarter (Note 11). Recent Product Launches and Late-Stage Product Pipeline Developments Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We have achieved a number of successes with recent product launches and late-stage pipeline developments, including: • We are in the process of rolling out the global launches of a number of new products, including Alimta®, Byetta®, Cialis®, Cymbalta®, Forteo®, Strattera®, Symbyax®, and Yentreve®. In addition, we recently launched new indications or formulations of Alimta, Cymbalta, Gemzar®, Humatrope®, and Zyprexa. • We launched Cymbalta for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the U.S. in August 2004. In September 2004, Cymbalta received its second U.S. approval and became the first FDA-approved treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). Cymbalta was launched in the United Kingdom and Germany in the first quarter of 2005 for the treatment of major depressive episodes. Other launches in the European Union are expected to occur throughout 2006. The European Commission also granted marketing authorization of Cymbalta for the treatment of DPNP in adults in July 2005. Cymbalta has achieved $728.9 million in U.S. sales since its launch. • In June 2005, Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., launched Byetta (exenatide), the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics, in the U.S. for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we submitted Byetta for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Europe. • We expect to advance our pipeline during 2006 with three significant submissions anticipated, including Arxxanttm for diabetic retinopathy, Cymbalta for generalized anxiety disorder, and Evista for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women. 20 Table of Contents Legal and Governmental Matters Certain generic manufacturers have challenged our U.S. compound patent for Zyprexa and are seeking permission to market generic versions of Zyprexa prior to its patent expiration in 2011. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis ruled in our favor on all counts, upholding our patents. The decision has been appealed. In 2005, we entered into an agreement with plaintiffs’ attorneys involved in certain U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a majority of the claims against us relating to the medication. We established a fund of $690 million for the claimants who agree to settle their claims. Additionally, we paid $10 million to cover administration of the settlement. As a result of our product liability exposures, the substantial majority of which were related to Zyprexa, we recorded a net pretax charge of $1.07 billion in the second quarter of 2005. In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that it has commenced a civil investigation relating to our U.S. sales, marketing, and promotional practices. In the United States, implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which provides a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program, took effect January 1, 2006. While it is difficult to predict the business impact of this legislation, we currently anticipate a modest short-term increase in sales. However, in the long term there is additional risk of increased pricing pressures. While the MMA prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers, we expect continued challenges to that prohibition over the next several years. Also, the MMA retains the authority of the Secretary of HHS to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs, but we expect Congress to consider several measures that could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the U.S. regardless of their safety or cost. If adopted, such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our U.S. sales. We believe there is some chance that the new and expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors under the MMA will alleviate the need for a federal importation scheme. As a result of the passage of the MMA, aged and disabled patients jointly eligible for Medicare and Medicaid began receiving their prescription drug benefits through the Medicare program, instead of Medicaid, on January 1, 2006. This may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures at the state level. A majority of states have begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their Medicaid programs, and these programs are expected to continue in the post-MMA environment. Several states are also attempting to extend discounted Medicaid prices to non-Medicaid patients. Additionally, notwithstanding the federal law prohibiting drug importation, approximately a dozen states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens, usually involving a website that links patients to selected Canadian pharmacies. One state has such a program for its state employees. As a result, we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue. International operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. 21 Table of Contents Operating Results — 2005 Sales Our worldwide sales for 2005 increased 6 percent, to $14.65 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, Forteo, and Gemzar. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac®, and Gemzar) that reduced our sales by approximately $170 million. Sales growth in 2005 was also affected by decreased U.S. demand for Zyprexa, Strattera, and Prozac. Despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand, sales in the U.S. increased 2 percent, to $7.80 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta and Alimta. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $6.85 billion, driven by growth of Zyprexa, Alimta, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of 3 percent, with global selling prices contributing 1 percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing 1 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.)

(2) Cialis had worldwide 2005 sales of $746.6 million, representing an increase of 35 percent compared with 2004. The sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we market Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses, is reported in net other income in our consolidated income statement. 22 Table of Contents Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 16 percent in 2005, resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to continuing competitive pressures. Sales outside the U.S. in 2005 increased 9 percent, driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased by 6 percent. In September 2005, the National Institute of Mental Health released the results of its Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study, which showed that Zyprexa was statistically superior on time to discontinuation in patients with schizophrenia as compared to other medications. Patients taking Zyprexa also experienced significantly fewer hospitalizations for schizophrenia than patients taking other medications. In addition, the study noted that Zyprexa patients experienced greater weight gain and increases in measures of glucose and lipid metabolism than patients using other antipsychotics. Diabetes care products, composed primarily of Humalog®, our insulin analog; Humulin®, a biosynthetic human insulin; Actos®, an oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; and recently-launched Byetta, the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics for type 2 diabetes that we market with Amylin Pharmaceuticals, had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.80 billion in 2005, an increase of 7 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased 7 percent, to $1.59 billion, primarily driven by higher prices, offset partially by a decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins market and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels of insulins. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.20 billion. Humalog sales increased 8 percent in the U.S. and 10 percent outside the U.S. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 3 percent, while Humulin sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent. Actos revenues, the majority of which represent service revenues from a copromotion agreement in the U.S. with Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (Takeda), increased 9 percent in 2005. Actos is manufactured by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., and sold in the U.S. by Takeda. Our U.S. marketing rights with respect to Actos expire in September 2006; however, we will continue receiving royalties from Takeda. As a result, our revenues from Actos will decline each year from 2006 through 2009. Our arrangement in the U.S. ceases after October 2009. Sales of Byetta were $74.6 million following its June 2005 launch. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta’s gross margin and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. This revenue totaled $39.6 million in 2005. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 4 percent in the U.S. Sales growth in the U.S. in 2005 was negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers. Gemzar sales increased 15 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications. 23 Table of Contents Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, decreased 2 percent in the U.S. due to a decline in U.S. underlying demand resulting from continued competitive pressures and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels. This decline was partially offset by price increases. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista increased 11 percent, driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in Japan. Cymbalta was launched in the U.S. in late August 2004 for the treatment of major depressive disorder and in September 2004 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Cymbalta launches began in Europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder during the first quarter of 2005, with additional launches expected through 2006. Cymbalta has been well accepted, generating $679.7 million in sales in 2005. Sales of Strattera, the only nonstimulant medicine approved for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, declined 24 percent in the U.S. in 2005 due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand. Sales outside the U.S. were $53.4 million in 2005, compared with $10.3 million in 2004, primarily reflecting recent launches in Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Spain. In the third quarter of 2005, we announced an important update to the Strattera label, communicating new information regarding uncommon reports of suicidal thoughts among children and adolescents. We have added a boxed warning to the label in the U.S. and are working with other regulatory agencies in countries where Strattera is approved to update the label information appropriately. Alimta was launched in the U.S. in February 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and in August for second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alimta was launched in several European countries in the second half of 2004 and throughout 2005. Alimta generated sales of $463.2 million in 2005. 24 Table of Contents Forteo, a treatment for both men and postmenopausal women suffering from severe osteoporosis, increased 34 percent in the U.S. in 2005, driven by strong growth in underlying demand. Sales growth was offset, in part, by wholesaler destocking in the first half of 2005 related to our new arrangements with U.S. wholesalers. Cialis, an erectile dysfunction treatment, is promoted in North America and Europe jointly by Lilly and ICOS Corporation, and by Lilly exclusively in the rest of the world. The $746.6 million of worldwide Cialis sales in 2005, an increase of 35 percent compared to 2004, comprises $169.9 million of sales in our territories, which are reported in our net sales, and $576.7 million of sales in the joint-venture territories. Within the joint-venture territories, U.S. sales of Cialis were $272.9 million for 2005, an increase of 32 percent, despite wholesaler destocking in the first half of the year as a result of our restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers. Cialis continues to increase its market share in most major markets in this extremely competitive category. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 9 percent, while sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, led by Rumensin and Paylean. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2005 gross margin decreased to 76.3 percent of sales compared with 76.7 percent for 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses. Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development and marketing and administrative expenses) increased 8 percent in 2005. Investment in research and development increased 12 percent, to $3.03 billion, in 2005, due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005, decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing 25 Table of Contents approximately 21 percent of our sales into research and development during 2005. Marketing and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2005, to $4.50 billion, due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. This comparison also benefited from a charitable contribution to the Lilly Foundation during the fourth quarter of 2004. Research and development expenses would have increased by 8 percent, and marketing and administrative expenses would have been flat for 2005, if 2004 had been restated as if stock options had been expensed. Net other income for 2005 increased $89.4 million, to $419.4 million, primarily due to the Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture becoming profitable during 2005 and increased interest income, partially offset by less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and partnered products in development. We report our 50 percent share of the operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture in our net other income. For 2005, our net income from the joint venture was $11.1 million, compared with a net loss of $79.0 million in 2004. The joint venture became profitable for the first time in the third quarter of 2005. Interest expense for 2005 increased $53.6 million, to $105.2 million, primarily due to an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for 2005 was 26.3 percent, compared with 38.5 percent for 2004. The effective tax rate for 2005 was affected by the product liability charge of $1.07 billion. The tax benefit of this charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. The effective tax rate for 2004 was affected by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation of $8.00 billion of earnings reinvested outside the U.S. pursuant to the AJCA and the charge for acquired IPR&D related to the AME acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 26 Table of Contents Operating Results — 2004 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 10 percent, due in part to the launch during the year of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets. We continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities, resulting in costs of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales. Despite significant product launch expenditures, our cost-containment and productivity measures resulted in marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate significantly less than sales. We also benefited from an increase in net other income in 2004. Net income was $1.81 billion, or $1.66 per share, in 2004, as compared with $2.56 billion, or $2.37 per share, in 2003, decreases of 29 and 30 percent, respectively. Certain items, reflected in our operating results for 2004 and 2003, should be considered in comparing the two years. The significant items for 2004 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2003 items are summarized as follows (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). • We recognized asset impairments, primarily relating to manufacturing assets in the U.S., and streamlined our infrastructure, resulting in severance-related and other charges totaling $167.1 million (pretax) in the first quarter and $28.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by approximately $.10 and $.02 in the first and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively (Note 4). • Separately, we recognized asset impairments and other charges of $186.8 million (pretax) in the first quarter of 2003 related primarily to our common stock ownership and loan agreements with Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Isis), which decreased earnings per share by $.13 in that quarter (Note 4). • In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a gain of $65.0 million (pretax) related to the sale of patent rights to dapoxetine for development in the field of genitourinary disorders to PPD, Inc., which increased earnings per share by $.04 in that quarter. Sales Our worldwide sales for 2004 increased 10 percent, to $13.86 billion, due primarily to the increased global sales of Strattera, Gemzar, Forteo, Zyprexa, Evista, Humatrope, and Cialis, and sales related to the launches of Alimta and Cymbalta. Sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent, to $7.67 billion. Sales outside the U.S. increased 15 percent, to $6.19 billion. Worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of 5 percent, with global selling prices contributing 2 percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing 3 percent. 27 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2004 compared with 2003: Year Ended December 31, 2004 Year Ended Percent December 31, 2003 Change Product U.S.(1) Outside U.S. Total Total from 2003 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,422.2 $ 1,997.6 $ 4,419.8 $ 4,276.9 3 Gemzar 565.1 649.3 1,214.4 1,021.7 19 Humalog 685.4 416.2 1,101.6 1,021.3 8 Evista 667.9 344.8 1,012.7 922.1 10 Humulin 422.7 575.0 997.7 1,060.4 (6 ) Animal health products 338.9 459.8 798.7 726.6 10 Strattera 656.4 10.3 666.7 370.3 80 Fluoxetine products 327.3 231.7 559.0 645.1 (13 ) Anti-infectives 110.2 367.8 478.0 489.9 (2 ) Actos 340.4 112.5 452.9 431.2 5 Humatrope 204.8 225.5 430.3 370.9 16 ReoPro 175.4 187.4 362.8 364.4 0 Forteo 198.0 40.6 238.6 65.3 NM Xigris 123.3 78.5 201.8 160.4 26 Alimta 121.8 20.8 142.6 — NM Cialis(2) 1.4 129.2 130.6 73.5 78 Cymbalta 92.7 1.2 93.9 — NM Symbyax 70.1 0.1 70.2 — NM Other pharmaceutical products 144.5 341.1 485.6 582.5 (17 ) Total net sales $ 7,668.5 $ 6,189.4 $ 13,857.9 $ 12,582.5 10 NM — Not meaningful (1) U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. (2) Cialis had worldwide 2004 sales of $552.3 million, an increase of 172 percent compared with 2003. The sales shown in the tables above represent results in the territories in which we market Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses, is reported in net other income in our consolidated income statement. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 8 percent in 2004 due to a decline in underlying demand from continued competitive pressures. Zyprexa sales outside the U.S. increased 22 percent, driven by volume growth in a number of major markets outside the U.S. International Zyprexa sales growth also benefited from the impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased 13 percent in 2004. Diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.61 billion in 2004, an increase of 2 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. decreased 6 percent, to $1.49 billion. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 14 percent, to $1.12 billion. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 19 percent, driven primarily by volume declines due to competitive pressures. Humulin sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent. Humalog sales in the U.S. increased 3 percent as increased prices offset slight volume declines. Humalog sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, to $416.2 million. Actos revenues increased 5 percent in 2004. Sales of Gemzar increased 8 percent in the U.S. largely due to the May 2004 approval for the treatment of late-stage metastatic breast cancer. Gemzar sales increased 31 percent outside the U.S., 28 Table of Contents driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista increased 1 percent in the U.S. due to continued competitive pressures. Outside the U.S., Evista maintained a strong growth rate of 32 percent, driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in Japan. In 2004, Strattera generated an 80 percent increase over 2003 sales despite a very competitive landscape. In December 2004, we added a bolded warning to the product label, which indicates that the medication should be discontinued in patients with jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes) or in the event of laboratory evidence of liver injury. Forteo generated $238.6 million in sales in 2004, continuing the product’s strong growth trajectory following its U.S. launch in December 2002 and European launches in late 2003 and during 2004. The $552.3 million of worldwide Cialis sales in 2004, an increase of 172 percent compared to 2003, comprises $130.6 million of sales in our territories, which are reported in our net sales, and $421.7 million of sales in the joint-venture territories. Within the joint-venture territories, U.S. sales of Cialis were $206.6 million for 2004. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 9 percent, while sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, led by Tylan®, Rumensin, and Paylean. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2004 gross margin decreased to 76.7 percent of sales compared with 78.7 percent for 2003. The decrease was due primarily to continued investment in our manufacturing technical capabilities and capacity and the impact of foreign exchange rates, offset partially by favorable changes in product mix due to growth in sales of higher margin products. Operating expenses increased 9 percent in 2004. Investment in research and development increased 15 percent, to $2.69 billion, due to increased clinical trial and development expenses and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by reimbursements for research activities from our collaboration partners. We reinvested more than 19 percent of our sales into research and development. Marketing and administrative expenses increased 6 percent in 2004, to $4.28 billion, attributable primarily to increased selling expenses in support of the new and anticipated product launches, the impact of foreign exchange rates, increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses, increased charitable contributions to the Lilly Foundation, and increased product liability expenses, offset partially by ongoing marketing cost-containment measures and marketing expense reimbursement from collaboration partners. A majority of the reimbursements are ongoing. Net other income for 2004 increased $126.9 million to $330.0 million. The increase for 2004 was primarily due to income related to the outlicensing of legacy products outside the United States, milestone payments from collaborations on the duloxetine molecule, income related to a previously assigned patent arrangement of $30.0 million, and other miscellaneous income. This was offset partially by an increase in the net loss of the Lilly ICOS LLC joint venture, due primarily to increased marketing costs of Cialis in joint-venture territories, and the 2003 sale of dapoxetine patent rights. For 2004, our net loss from the joint venture was $79.0 million, compared with $52.4 million in 2003. The effective tax rate for 2004 was 38.5 percent, compared with 21.5 percent for 2003. The increase in the effective tax rate was caused by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation 29 Table of Contents of $8.00 billion of earnings reinvested outside the U.S. pursuant to the AJCA and the charge for acquired IPR&D related to the AME acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $5.04 billion compared with $7.46 billion at December 31, 2004. Cash flow from operations of $1.91 billion and net issuances of long-term debt of $2.00 billion were more than offset by net repayments of short-term debt of $1.99 billion, dividends paid of $1.65 billion, capital expenditures of $1.30 billion, net purchases of noncurrent investments of $638.0 million, and repurchases of common stock of $377.9 million. Capital expenditures of $1.30 billion during 2005 were $600.0 million less than in 2004, due primarily to the management of capital spending and completion of key projects. We expect near-term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2005 levels while we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes care and other products, as well as research and development activities. Total debt at December 31, 2005, was $6.50 billion, essentially unchanged compared to December 31, 2004. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s remain at AA and Aa3, respectively. Dividends of $1.52 per share were paid in 2005, an increase of 7 percent from 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, effective for the first-quarter dividend in 2006, the quarterly dividend was increased to $.40 per share (a 5 percent increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2006 of $1.60 per share. The year 2005 was the 121st consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 38th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. 30 Table of Contents On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), which created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. We planned to repatriate $8.00 billion in incentive dividends, as defined in the AJCA, during 2005 and accordingly, we recorded a related tax liability of $465.0 million as of December 31, 2004. During 2005, we repatriated all $8.00 billion of eligible incentive dividends. The proceeds from the incentive dividends have been or will be used for research and development activities, capital asset expenditures, and other permitted activities. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, dividends, and taxes in 2006. We believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be adequate to fund maturities of short-term borrowings, if necessary. Our commercial paper program is also currently backed by $1.23 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities. We currently expect to repay approximately $1.5 billion of debt by the end of 2006, using available cash. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2006 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between 31 Table of Contents fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2005 and 2004, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. These arrangements are not material individually. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same year, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. The inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur, as the failure rate for products in development is very high. In addition, these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. 32 Table of Contents Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less More Than 1-3 3-5 Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt, including interest payments(1) $ 12,024.1 $ 983.3 $ 3,893.8 $ 187.6 $ 6,959.4 Capital lease obligations 177.1 21.0 36.5 31.4 88.2 Operating leases 335.5 86.5 130.2 84.5 34.3 Purchase obligations(2) 2,388.5 2,299.5 58.1 28.5 2.4 Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet(3) 599.7 — 90.6 90.6 418.5 Other(4) 73.1 73.1 — — — Total $ 15,598.0 $ 3,463.4 $ 4,209.2 $ 422.6 $ 7,502.8 (1) Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2005 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. (2) We have included the following: • Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2005. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. • Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. (3) We have included our long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. (4) This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2005. The amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. Application of Critical Accounting Policies In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. This is generally at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. 33 Table of Contents We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. We are generally able to determine when significant wholesaler stocking or destocking has occurred during a particular period, but we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Causes of unusual buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. An unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the U.S. could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our sales by approximately $170 million. The new structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying we have seen in the past and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our U.S. wholesalers. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns, which have been approximately 1 percent or less of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate/discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales rebates/discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, chargebacks, long-term-care, hospital, discount card programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate/discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate/discount contracts. We calculate these rebates/discounts based upon a percentage of our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory rates and the contracts with our various customer groups. The largest of our sales rebate/discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically billed up to six months later. Due to the time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate/discount contracts. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. 34 Table of Contents We believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs reduced sales by $626.6 million, $641.0 million, and $567.6 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. A 5 percent change in the Medicaid rebate expense we recognized in 2005 would lead to an approximate $31 million effect on our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. As of December 31, 2005, our Medicaid rebate liability was $272.5 million. Approximately 90 percent and 86 percent of our global rebate and discount liability results from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. rebate and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2005 2004 Rebate and discount liability, beginning of year $ 367.9 $ 398.0 Reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates(1) 1,289.6 1,157.0 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (1,288.6 ) (1,187.1 ) Rebate and discount liability, end of year $ 368.9 $ 367.9 (1) Adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we have accrued for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial position of the insurers, and the possibility of and the length of time for collection. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. 35 Table of Contents Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets and the health-care-cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve for purposes of determination of the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2005 annual expense would increase by approximately $26 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2005 service cost and interest cost by approximately $22 million. If the discount rate for 2005 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would change by approximately $27 million. If the expected return on plan assets for 2005 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would change by approximately $13 million. If our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for 2005 were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would be affected by approximately $22 million. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We record a liability for tax contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. The tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances, and additional uncertainties. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances reserved against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately $23 million. 36 Table of Contents Financial Expectations for 2006 For the full year of 2006, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20. We expect sales to grow 7 to 9 percent and gross margins as a percent of sales to improve modestly compared with 2005. In addition, we expect operating expenses to grow in the mid-single digits in the aggregate, with marketing and administrative expenses accelerating while research and development expense growth moderates somewhat. However, we will continue to be among the industry leaders in terms of research and development investment as a percent of sales. We also expect other income, net of interest expense, to contribute approximately $175 million to $275 million; this ongoing net contribution is expected to be driven primarily by net interest income, Lilly ICOS joint venture after-tax profit, and partnering and out-licensing of molecules. We also anticipate the effective tax rate to be approximately 21 percent. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in-process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, and government investigations; the outcome of the Zyprexa patent appeal; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements. Legal and Regulatory Matters Three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Zenith), Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (Reddy), and Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva), submitted abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic versions of Zyprexa in various dosage forms several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents for the product. The generic companies alleged that our patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. We filed suit against the three companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that the challenges to our compound patent (expiring in 2011) are without merit. The cases were consolidated, and on April 14, 2005, the district court upheld our 2011 U.S. patent on Zyprexa. In the case of Eli Lilly and Company v. Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals et al., the court ruled in our favor on all counts, including the patent doctrines of obviousness, double patenting, inequitable conduct, novelty, and public use. The decision has been appealed. We are confident, and the trial court confirmed, that the generic manufacturers’ claims are without merit, and we expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation and, accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail on appeal. An unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In 2002, Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr), submitted an ANDA with the FDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista (raloxifene) several years prior to the expiration of our U.S. patents covering the product, alleging that the patents are invalid or not infringed. In November 2002, we filed suit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that Barr’s challenges to our patents claiming the methods of use and pharmaceutical form (expiring from 2012 to 2017) are without merit. Barr has also asserted that the method of use patents are unenforceable. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued to us two new patents (expiring in 2017) directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing raloxifene and a 37 Table of Contents method for preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis and a third (expiring in 2012) directed to methods of inhibiting postmenopausal bone loss by administering a single daily oral dose of raloxifene. These patents have been listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. Barr has challenged these patents, alleging that each is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed. These patents have been added to the pending suit. The suit is in discovery. No trial date has been set at this time. While we believe that Barr’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation. Therefore, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In January 2006, we were notified that Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), a subsidiary of Teva, submitted an ANDA with the FDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Gemzar several years prior to the expiration of two U.S. patents covering the product. Sicor alleged that both U.S. patents are invalid. In February, we filed suit against Sicor in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that Sicor’s challenges to our patents claiming the compound (expiring in 2010) and the methods of use (expiring in 2012) are without merit. While we believe that Sicor’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the litigation. Therefore, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. In July 2002, we received the first of several grand jury subpoenas for documents from the Office of Consumer Litigation, U.S. Department of Justice, related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications with respect to Evista. We reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in the fourth quarter of 2005, which was subsequently approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana in February 2006. As part of the settlement, Lilly pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The plea is for the off-label promotion of Evista during 1998. The government did not, however, charge the company with any unlawful intent, nor do we acknowledge any such intent. In connection with the overall settlement, we agreed to pay a total of $36 million. As previously reported, Lilly took a charge in the fourth quarter of 2004 in connection with this investigation. The 2004 charge was sufficient to cover this settlement payment; consequently, no further charge will be necessary. In March 2004, the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised us that it has commenced a civil investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weeklytm. In October 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering Axid, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of Lilly’s Medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements. We are cooperating with the U.S. Attorney in these investigations, including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. It is possible that other Lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on 38 Table of Contents our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance-related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices, physician communications, remuneration of health care professionals, managed care arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations. We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the United States and have been notified of several thousand claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). The MDL includes three lawsuits requesting certification of class actions on behalf of those who allegedly suffered injuries from the administration of Zyprexa. We have entered into agreements with various plaintiffs’ counsel halting the running of the statutes of limitation (tolling agreements) with respect to a large number of claimants who do not have lawsuits on file. In June 2005, we entered into an agreement in principle (followed by a definitive master settlement agreement in September 2005) with a group of plaintiffs’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a majority of the claims. The agreement covers more than 8,000 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits (including the three purported class actions), tolled claims, and other informally asserted claims. We established a fund of $690 million for the claimants to settle their claims, and $10 million to cover administration of the settlement. The settlement fund is being overseen and distributed by claims administrators appointed by the court. The agreement and the distribution of funds to participating claimants are conditioned upon, among other things, our obtaining full releases from no fewer than 7,193 claimants. Following this settlement, the remaining U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims include approximately 150 lawsuits in the U.S. covering 465 claimants, and approximately 825 tolled claims. In addition, we have been informally advised of a number of additional potential U.S. claims, but to date have received no substantiation of the claims. Also, in early 2005, we were served with five lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the United States. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining cases. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments on account of their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. In addition, in 2006 a similar lawsuit was filed in the Eastern District of New York on similar grounds. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed 39 Table of Contents to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York. In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. In connection with the Zyprexa product liability claims, certain of our insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and to date have failed to reimburse us for claim-related costs despite demand from the first-layer carriers for payment. However, in our opinion, the defenses identified to date appear to lack substance. In March 2005, we filed suit against several of the carriers in state court in Indiana to obtain reimbursement of costs related to the Zyprexa product liability litigation. The matter has been removed to the federal court in Indianapolis. Several carriers have asserted defenses to their liability, and some carriers are seeking rescission of the coverage. While we believe our position is meritorious, there can be no assurance that we will prevail. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. With respect to the product liability claims currently asserted against us, we have accrued for our estimated exposures to the extent they are both probable and estimable based on the information available to us. In addition, we have accrued for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability loss contingencies are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. A portion of the costs associated with defending and disposing of these suits is covered by insurance. We record receivables for insurance-related recoveries when it is probable they will be realized. These receivables are classified as a reduction of the litigation charges on the statement of income. We estimate insurance recoverables based on existing deductibles, coverage limits, our assessment of any defenses to coverage that might be raised by the carriers, and the existing and projected future level of insolvencies among the insurance carriers. In the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a net pre-tax charge of $1.07 billion for product liability matters, which includes the following: • The $700 million Zyprexa settlement and administration fee; • Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding currently known and expected claims to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. A substantial majority of these exposures and costs relate to current and expected Zyprexa claims not included in the settlement. We have estimated these charges based primarily on historical claims experience, data regarding product usage, and our historical product liability defense cost experience. The $1.07 billion net charge took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance coverage related to these matters. The after-tax impact of this net charge was $.90 per share. The $700 million for the Zyprexa settlement was paid during 2005, while the cash related to the other reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs is expected to be paid out over the next several years. The timing of our insurance recoveries is uncertain. We cannot predict with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. In addition, although we believe it is probable, there can be no assurance that the Zyprexa 40 Table of Contents settlement described above will be concluded. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims, and because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for other products in the future. We have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market, and therefore will be largely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the patent, product liability, or other legal actions brought against us, we believe that, except as noted above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to the consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.

59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, significant business development, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and legal and governmental matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 7 percent, primarily as a result of strong growth of our newer products. We increased our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta® and diabetes care products, and continued our commitment to research and development, investing approximately 20 percent of our sales during 2006. Our results also benefited from continued growth in profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint venture as well as cost-containment and productivity initiatives. Net income was $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006 as compared with $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005, representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 35 percent. Net income comparisons between 2006 and 2005 are affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results (see Notes 2, 4, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): 2006 • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges of $450.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.31 (Note 4). • In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge related to Zyprexa® product liability litigation matters of $494.9 million (pretax), or $.42 per share (Notes 4 and 13). 2005 • We incurred a charge related to product liability litigation matters, primarily related to Zyprexa, of $1.07 billion (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.90 in the second quarter of 2005 (Notes 4 and 13). • We recognized asset impairments and other special charges of $171.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.14 (Note 4). • We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $22.0 million (after-tax), which decreased earnings per share by $.02 (Note 2). -16- Business Development, and Recent Product and Late-Stage Pipeline Developments Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We have achieved a number of successes with recent product launches and late-stage pipeline developments, including: • On January 29, 2007, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Corporation for approximately $2.3 billion in cash. The acquisition brings the full value of Cialis® to us and enables us to realize operational efficiencies in the further development, marketing and selling of this product. The allocation of the purchase price has not yet been completed; however, we anticipate that the one-time charge to earnings for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) will approximate $300 million (no tax benefit) (Note 3). • In November 2006, we received European Commission authorization to market Byetta® as a treatment for type 2 diabetes with our partner, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin). In addition, in December 2006, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Byetta as an add-on therapy to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved adequate control on a thiazolidinedione (TZD). • We submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for Evista® for the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer. • We initiated a Phase III clinical trial to study enzastaurin as a maintenance therapy to prevent relapse in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Additionally, we closed the enrollment of a Phase III study of enzastaurin for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma after an external data monitoring committee determined the study would likely not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. -17- • In July 2006, we received FDA approval for Gemzar®for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with carboplatin. Additionally, the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recommended Gemzar coverage under the UK’s National Health Service for the use of Gemzar, in combination with paclitaxel, within a limited population of breast cancer patients. • In September 2006, we received an approvable letter from the FDA for Arxxanttm for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. The FDA has indicated that it will require efficacy data from an additional Phase III study before it will consider approving the molecule. We decided to appeal the FDA’s decision and began discussions with the agency. There can be no assurance that our appeal will be successful. • We submitted a supplemental NDA to the FDA for Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. We are also conducting Phase III studies on Cymbalta for the treatment of fibromyalgia, a chronic, often debilitating pain disorder. • In January 2007, we licensed from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OSI), its glucokinase activator (GKA) program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, including the lead compound PSN010. We received an exclusive license to develop and market any compounds derived from the GKA program. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $25.0 million (pretax) (Note 3). • In January 2007, along with our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, we announced that we completed enrollment in the TRITON study, a Phase III head-to-head study comparing prasugrel to clopidogrel (Plavix®) in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Legal and Governmental Matters In December 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a district court ruling upholding the validity of our Zyprexa patent. We are very confident we will maintain our U.S. patent protection on Zyprexa until 2011. We have reached agreements with claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately 28,500 claims against us relating to the medication. Approximately 1,300 claims remain. As a result of our product liability exposures, the substantial majority of which were related to -18- Zyprexa, we recorded net pretax charges of $1.07 billion in the second quarter of 2005 and $494.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that it had commenced a civil investigation relating to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices. In the United States, implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which provides a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program, took effect January 1, 2006. In 2006, we experienced a one-time sales benefit as a result of MMA; however, in the long term there is additional risk of increased pricing pressures. While the MMA prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers, legislation was passed in early 2007 by the U.S. House of Representatives that would require HHS to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This legislation will be considered by the U.S. Senate. MMA retains the authority of the Secretary of HHS to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs. Legislation to allow for broad-scale importation has been presented to both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The proposed legislation could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the U.S. If adopted, such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our U.S. sales. Current importation language allows for medication to be carried in person from Canada to the U.S. and does not authorize mail or Internet importation. Further, the language disallows certain medications including injectibles. We believe the expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors under the MMA has further alleviated the perceived need for a federal importation scheme. However, notwithstanding the federal law that continues to prohibit all but the very narrow drug importation detailed above, several states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens, usually involving a website that links patients to selected Canadian pharmacies. The successful implementation of the MMA may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures at the state level. A majority of states have implemented supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their Medicaid programs, and these programs are expected to continue in the post-MMA environment. Moreover, under the 2005 federal Deficit Reduction Act, states will have greater flexibility to impose new cost-sharing requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries for non-preferred prescription drugs that will result in certain beneficiaries bearing more of the cost. Several states also are attempting to extend discounted Medicaid prices to non-Medicaid patients. As a result, we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue. As it relates to the Medicare program, Lilly has implemented the LillyMedicareAnswers program. Lilly- MedicareAnswers is a new patient assistance program that provides certain eligible Medicare Part D enrolled patients access to a one month’s-supply of select medications for a $25 administrative fee per prescription. Medications available via the program include Zyprexa, Forteo®, and Humatrope®. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. OPERATING RESULTS — 2006 Sales Our worldwide sales for 2006 increased 7 percent, to $15.69 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of Cymbalta, Forteo, Byetta, Zyprexa, and Alimta®. Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent and selling prices increased sales by 4 percent. Foreign exchange rates did not impact our overall sales growth. Sales in the U.S. increased 10 percent, to $8.60 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, diabetes care products, Forteo, and Zyprexa. U.S. growth comparisons benefited from an estimated $170 million of wholesaler destocking that had occurred in 2005 as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in the first quarter of 2005. Additionally, we experienced a one-time sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain low-income patients from Medicaid to Medicare and increased access to medical coverage by certain patients previously covered under our LillyAnswers program following the implementation -19- of MMA in 2006. This contributed part of the increases in U.S. net effective sales prices of 9 percent. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, to $7.09 billion, driven by growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, and Zyprexa. Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 4 percent in 2006, driven by higher prices, offset in part by lower demand. The increase in net effective selling prices was partially due to the transition of certain low-income patients from Medicaid to Medicare. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven primarily by increased demand, offset in part by declining prices.

The sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we market Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other income — net in our consolidated statements of income. -20- Diabetes care products, composed primarily of Humalog, our insulin analog; Humulin, a biosynthetic human insulin; Actos, an oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; and Byetta, the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics for type 2 diabetes that we market with Amylin, had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.96 billion in 2006, an increase of 6 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.73 billion. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 2 percent, to $1.23 billion. Results from our primary diabetes care products are as follows: • Humalog sales increased 10 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices and increased 7 percent outside the U.S., due primarily to increased volume, offset partially by lower prices. • Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 10 percent due primarily to decreased volume, offset partially by increased selling prices. Outside the U.S., Humulin sales decreased 6 percent due to decreases in demand and selling prices. • Actos revenues in the U.S., the majority of which represent service revenues from a copromotion agreement in the U.S. with Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (Takeda), decreased 22 percent in 2006. Actos is manufactured by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., and sold in the U.S. by Takeda. Our U.S. marketing rights with respect to Actos expired in September 2006; however, we will continue receiving royalties from Takeda. As a result, our revenues from Actos will decline each year through September 2009. Our arrangement outside the U.S. continues. Sales outside the U.S. increased 23 percent, due primarily to increased volume in addition to a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset in part by lower prices. • Sales of Byetta, launched in the U.S. in June 2005, were $430.2 million for 2006. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta’s gross margin and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 4 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels in 2005. Gemzar sales increased 7 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, increased 82 percent in the U.S., due to strong demand. Sales of Cymbalta outside the U.S. reflect international launches. Worldwide sales exceeded $1 billion in 2006, the product’s second full year on the market. -21- Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices, offset partially by a decline in demand. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista decreased 1 percent, driven by lower prices, offset by an increase in demand. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma and second-line treatment for non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC), increased 18 percent and 57 percent in the U.S. and outside the U.S., respectively, due primarily to increased demand. Sales of Forteo, a treatment for severe osteoporosis, increased 57 percent in the U.S. In addition to increased demand, U.S. sales significantly benefited from patients’ access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D program and from decreased utilization of our U.S. patient assistance program, LillyAnswers. Sales outside the U.S. increased 43 percent, reflecting a strong demand. Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels in 2005, offset by a decline in demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 31 percent due primarily to increased demand in addition to a modest favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset partially by lower prices. Total product sales of Cialis, an erectile dysfunction treatment, increased 38 percent in the U.S. and 24 percent outside the U.S. Worldwide Cialis sales growth reflects the impact of market share gains, market growth, and price increases during 2006. Cialis sales in our territories are reported in net sales, while our 50 percent share of the joint-venture net income is reported in other income — net. All sales of Cialis subsequent to the ICOS acquisition in 2007 will be included in our revenue. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 10 percent, due primarily to increased demand led by Rumensin® and Tylan®. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, driven primarily by the decrease in the sales of Surmax® as a result of the European Union’s growth promotion use ban on the product, effective January 1, 2006. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2006 gross margin increased to 77.4 percent of sales compared with 76.3 percent for 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased product prices and increased production volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses. -22- Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development and marketing and administrative expenses) increased 7 percent in 2006. Investment in research and development increased 3 percent, to $3.13 billion, primarily due to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 20 percent of our sales into research and development during 2006. Marketing and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2006, to $4.89 billion. This increase was largely attributable to increased marketing expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care franchise, and an increase in litigation-related costs. Other income — net decreased $76.4 million, to $237.8 million, and consists of interest expense, interest income, the after-tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items. • Interest expense for 2006 increased $132.9 million, to $238.1 million. This increase is a result of higher interest rates and less capitalized interest due to the completion in late 2005 of certain manufacturing facilities. • Interest income for 2006 increased $49.8 million, to $261.9 million, due to higher short-term interest rates. • The Lilly ICOS joint-venture income was $96.3 million in 2006 as compared to $11.1 million in 2005. The increase was due to increased Cialis sales and decreased selling and marketing expenses. • Net other miscellaneous income items decreased $78.5 million to $117.7 million, primarily as a result of less income related to the outlicensing of legacy products and partnered compounds in development. We incurred tax expense of $755.3 million in 2006, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.1 percent, compared with 26.3 percent for 2005. The effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were affected primarily by the product liability charges of $494.9 million and $1.07 billion, respectively. The tax expense of these charges was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax expense was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. -23- OPERATING RESULTS — 2005 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 6 percent, due in part to the launch in 2004 of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets. In addition, we launched one new product in the U.S. and several new products, new indications, or new formulations in key markets in 2005. We continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities, resulting in cost of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales. Despite product launch expenditures, our cost-containment and productivity measures contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate less than sales. During 2005, we began to expense stock options, which had the effect of increasing our research and development and marketing and administrative expenses. We also benefited from an increase in other income — net, due primarily to increased profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and a decrease in the tax rate in 2005. Net income was $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005 as compared with $1.81 billion, or $1.66 per share, in 2004, representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 9 percent. Certain items, reflected in our operating results for 2005 and 2004, should be considered in comparing the two years. The significant items for 2005 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2004 items are summarized as follows (see Notes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): • In 2005, we began to expense stock options in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Had we expensed stock options in 2004, our 2004 net income would have been lower by $266.4 million, which would have decreased earnings per share by $.24 per share (Notes 1 and 7). • We recognized asset impairment charges, streamlined our infrastructure, and provided for the anticipated resolution of the government investigation of Evista marketing and promotional practices, resulting in charges of $108.9 million (pretax) in the second quarter of 2004 and $494.1 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter of 2004, which decreased earnings per share by $.08 and $.30, respectively (Note 4). • We incurred charges for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $362.3 million (no tax benefit) in the first quarter of 2004 related to the acquisition of Applied Molecular Evolution, Inc. (AME), and $29.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to our acquisition of a Phase I compound under development as a potential treatment for insomnia, which decreased earnings per share by $.33 in the first quarter of 2004 and $.02 in the fourth quarter of 2004 (Note 3). • We recognized tax expenses of $465.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 associated with the anticipated repatriation in 2005 of $8.00 billion of our earnings reinvested outside the U.S., as a result of the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). This tax expense decreased earnings per share by $.43 in that quarter (Note 10). Sales Our worldwide sales for 2005 increased 6 percent, to $14.65 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, Forteo, and Gemzar. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac®, and Gemzar) that reduced our sales by approximately $170 million. Sales growth in 2005 was also affected by decreased U.S. demand for Zyprexa, Strattera, and Prozac. Despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand, sales in the U.S. increased 2 percent, to $7.80 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta and Alimta. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $6.85 billion, driven by growth of Zyprexa, Alimta, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of 3 percent, with global selling prices contributing 1 percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing 1 percent.

The sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we market Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other income — net in our consolidated statements of income. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 16 percent in 2005, resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to continuing competitive pressures. Sales outside the U.S. in 2005 increased 9 percent, driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, sales of Zyprexa outside the U.S. increased by 6 percent. Diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.80 billion in 2005, an increase of 7 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased 7 percent, to $1.59 billion, primarily driven by higher prices, offset partially by a decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins market and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels of insulins. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.20 billion. Humalog sales increased 8 percent in the U.S. and 10 percent outside the U.S. Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 3 percent, while Humulin sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent. Actos revenues increased 9 percent in 2005. Sales of Byetta were $74.6 million following its June 2005 launch. Our reported net sales of Byetta totaled $39.6 million in 2005. Sales of Gemzar increased 4 percent in the U.S. in 2005 and were negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers. Gemzar sales increased 15 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications. Sales of Evista decreased 2 percent in the U.S. due to declines in U.S. underlying demand resulting from continued competitive pressures and to reductions in wholesaler inventory levels. This decline was partially -25- offset by price increases. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista increased 11 percent, driven by volume growth in several markets and the early 2004 launch of the product in Japan. Cymbalta was launched in the U.S. in late August 2004 for the treatment of major depressive disorder and in September 2004 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Cymbalta launches began in Europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder during the first quarter of 2005. Cymbalta generated $679.7 million in sales in 2005. Sales of Strattera declined 24 percent in the U.S. in 2005 due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand. Sales outside the U.S. were $53.4 million in 2005, compared with $10.3 million in 2004, primarily reflecting launches in Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Spain. Alimta was launched in the U.S. in February 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and in August for second-line treatment of non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alimta was launched in several European countries in the second half of 2004 and throughout 2005. Alimta generated sales of $463.2 million in 2005. Forteo increased 34 percent in the U.S. in 2005, driven by strong growth in underlying demand. Sales growth was offset, in part, by wholesaler destocking in the first half of 2005 related to our revised arrangements with U.S. wholesalers. Cialis worldwide sales of $746.6 million in 2005 reflected an increase of 35 percent compared to 2004, and comprises $169.9 million of sales in our territories, and $576.7 million of sales in the joint-venture territories. Within the joint-venture territories, U.S. sales of Cialis were $272.9 million for 2005, an increase of 32 percent, despite wholesaler destocking in the first half of the year as a result of our restructured arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 9 percent, while sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, led by Rumensin and Paylean®. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2005 gross margin decreased to 76.3 percent of sales compared with 76.7 percent for 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses. Operating expenses increased 8 percent in 2005. Investment in research and development increased 12 percent, to $3.03 billion, in 2005, due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005, decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 21 percent of our sales into research and development during 2005. Marketing and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2005, to $4.50 billion, due to the adoption of stock option expensing in 2005, and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses. This comparison also benefited from a charitable contribution to the Lilly Foundation during the fourth quarter of 2004. Research and development expenses would have increased by 8 percent, and marketing and administrative expenses would have been flat for 2005, if 2004 had been restated as if stock options had been expensed. Other income — net increased $35.8 million in 2005, to $314.2 million, due to the following: • Interest expense for 2005 increased $53.6 million, to $105.2 million, primarily due to increased interest rates. • Interest income for 2005 increased $55.4 million, to $212.1 million, due to increased investment balances and interest rates. -26- • Our net income from the Lilly ICOS joint venture was $11.1 million for 2005, compared with a net loss of $79.0 million in 2004. The joint venture became profitable for the first time in the third quarter of 2005. • Net other miscellaneous income items decreased $56.1 million to $196.2 million, primarily as a result of less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and partnered products in development. The effective tax rate for 2005 was 26.3 percent, compared with 38.5 percent for 2004. The effective tax rate for 2005 was affected by the product liability charge of $1.07 billion. The tax benefit of this charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. The effective tax rate for 2004 was affected by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation of $8.00 billion of earnings reinvested outside the U.S. pursuant to the AJCA and the charge for acquired IPR&D related to the AME acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $3.89 billion compared with $5.04 billion at December 31, 2005. Strong cash flow from operations in 2006 of $3.98 billion was more than offset by repayments of long-term debt of $2.78 billion, dividends paid of $1.74 billion, and capital expenditures of $1.08 billion. Capital expenditures of $1.08 billion during 2006 were $220.3 million less than in 2005, due primarily to the management of capital spending and completion of key projects. We expect near-term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2006 levels while we invest in our biotech and research and development initiatives, continue to upgrade our manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems, and invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes care products. Total debt as of December 31, 2006 was $3.71 billion, reflecting a net repayment of $2.78 billion during 2006. In early 2007, we issued approximately $2.5 billion of debt to finance our acquisition of ICOS, including the acquisition of ICOS stock and refinancing of ICOS debt. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s remain at AA and Aa3, respectively. Dividends of $1.60 per share were paid in 2006, an increase of 5 percent from 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, effective for the first-quarter dividend in 2007, the quarterly dividend was increased to $.425 per share (a 6 percent increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2007 of $1.70 per share. The year 2006 was the 122nd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 39th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. -27- We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, costs associated with product liability litigation, dividends, and taxes in 2007. We believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be adequate to fund maturities of short-term borrowings, if necessary. We currently have $1.21 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Excluding the longterm debt issued for the ICOS acquisition, we plan to use available cash to repay approximately $1 billion of debt outside the U.S. by the end of 2007. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2007 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. -28- In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2006 and 2005, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, -29- results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt, including interest payments1 $ 5,638.1 $ 374.0 $ 1,703.5 $ 265.4 $ 3,295.2 Capital lease obligations 152.6 19.8 36.1 24.2 72.5 Operating leases 412.2 92.2 136.0 76.8 107.2 Purchase obligations2 2,105.0 1,879.4 140.9 68.3 16.4 Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 836.8 78.6 135.9 138.2 484.1 Other4 67.1 67.1 — — — Total $ 9,211.8 $ 2,511.1 $ 2,152.4 $ 572.9 $ 3,975.4 1 Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2006 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: • Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2006. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. • Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included our long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. 4 This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. The inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur, as the failure rate for products in development is very high. In addition, these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2006. The amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, -30- expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than 90 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. An unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the U.S. could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our 2005 sales by approximately $170 million. The modified structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our U.S. wholesalers. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns, which have been approximately 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate/discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales rebates/discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, discount card programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate/discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate/discount contracts. We calculate these rebates/discounts based upon a percentage of our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory rates and the contracts with our various customer groups. The largest of our sales rebate/discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically billed up to six months later. Due to the time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate/discount contracts. -31- Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid) and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $571.7 million, $637.1 million, and $641.0 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. A 5 percent change in the Medicaid and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2006 would lead to an approximate $29 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2006, our Medicaid and Medicare rebate liability was $259.0 million. Approximately 85 percent and 90 percent of our global rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. rebate and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2006 2005 Rebate and discount liability, beginning of year $ 379.4 $ 367.9 Reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates1 1,246.1 1,300.1 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (1,242.2 ) (1,288.6 ) Rebate and discount liability, end of year $ 383.3 $ 379.4 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial position of the insurers, and the possibility of and the length of time for collection. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts -32- reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets and the health-care-cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2006 annual expense would increase by approximately $28 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2006 service cost and interest cost by approximately $24 million. If the discount rate for 2006 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $28 million. If the expected return on plan assets for 2006 were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $14 million. If our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for 2006 were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately $29 million. Impairment of Long-lived Assets We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We record a liability for tax contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. The tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances and additional uncertainties. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carry forwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future -33- income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately $25 million. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2007 For the full year of 2007, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.99. This guidance includes the estimated $.10 per share dilutive impact of the ICOS acquisition related to the incremental interest expense on debt used to finance the acquisition, the amortization of ICOS intangibles and other integration costs. A disproportionate amount of this dilution is expected to be incurred in the first half of the year. This guidance also includes the IPR&D charges related to the ICOS acquisition and the in-licensing of a diabetes compound from OSI, together estimated to be a total of $.29 per share as discussed in Note 3, as well as additional restructuring and other special charges as discussed in Note 4, estimated to be $.07 per share. We expect sales to grow in the high single or low double digits, impacted favorably by the inclusion of all Cialis revenue subsequent to the acquisition. Gross margins as a percent of sales are expected to improve slightly compared with 2006. In addition, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low double digits, driven primarily by the inclusion of all Cialis operating expenses subsequent to the acquisition and increased marketing and selling expenses in support of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, and the diabetes care franchise, as well as ongoing investment in research and development that will continue to place Lilly among the industry leaders in terms of research and development as a percent of sales. We also expect other income — net to contribute less than $100 million, a reduction from 2006 due to the removal of the Lilly ICOS joint venture after-tax profit. Other income will primarily include net interest income and income from the partnering and out-licensing of molecules. In terms of cash flow, we expect a continuation of strong cash flow trends in 2007, with capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in-process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation and government investigations; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): • Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (Reddy), Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals (together, Teva), each submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic versions of Zyprexa prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patent (expiring in 2011) and alleging that this patent was invalid or not enforceable. We filed lawsuits against these companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that the patent is valid, enforceable and being infringed. The district court ruled in our favor on all counts on April 14, 2005, and on December 26, 2006, that ruling was upheld by the Court -34- of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Reddy and Teva are seeking a review of that decision. We are confident Reddy’s and Teva’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail. An unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. • Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr), submitted an ANDA in 2002 seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2012-2017) and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that our relevant U.S. patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Teva. No trial date has been set in either case. We believe Barr’s and Teva’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. • Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), a subsidiary of Teva, submitted ANDAs in November 2005 seeking permission to market generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2010 and 2013), and alleging that these patents are invalid. In February 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Sicor in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid and are being infringed by Sicor. In response to our lawsuit, Sicor filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Sicor also moved to dismiss our lawsuit in Indiana, asserting the Indiana court lacks jurisdiction. The California action has been dismissed. In September 2006, we received notice that Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (Mayne) filed a similar ANDA for Gemzar. In October 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Mayne in the Southern District of Indiana in response to the ANDA filing. In response to our lawsuit, Mayne filed a motion to our lawsuit, asserting the Indiana court lacks jurisdiction. In October 2006, we received notice that Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) filed an ANDA for Gemzar, alleging that the 2013 patent is invalid. In December 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Sun in the Southern District of Indiana in response to Sun’s ANDA filing. We expect to prevail in litigation involving our Gemzar patents and believe that claims made by these generic companies that our patents are not valid are without merit. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In June 2002, we were sued by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the President and Fellows of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products. In June 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office commenced a re-examination of the patent in order to consider certain issues raised by us relating to the validity of the patent. On May 4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $65 million in damages, calculated by applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial. We are seeking to have the jury verdict overturned by the trial court judge, and if unsuccessful, will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held the week of August 7, 2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes. No decision has been rendered. We believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote. -35- Government Investigations In March 2004, the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania advised us that it had commenced a civil investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weeklytm. In October 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s Office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering Axid®, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of Lilly’s Medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements. We are cooperating with the U.S. Attorney in these investigations, including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. In September 2006, we received a subpoena from the California Attorney General’s office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexa’s status on California’s formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and remuneration of health care providers. Beginning in August 2006, we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states. Most of these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. We are aware that 26 states are participating in this joint effort, and we anticipate that additional states will join the investigation. These attorneys general are seeking a broad range of Zyprexa documents, including documents relating to sales, marketing and promotional practices, and remuneration of health care providers. It is possible that other Lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance-related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices, physician communications, remuneration of health care professionals, managed care arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations. Product Liability and Related Litigation We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the United States and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 28,500 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows: • In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000 claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover administration of the settlement. That settlement is being administered by special settlement masters appointed by Judge Weinstein. • In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs’ attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for approximately $500 million. -36- The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during 2005. The January 2007 settlements were recorded in other current liabilities in our December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet and will be paid in the first quarter of 2007. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 340 lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 900 claimants and an additional 400 claims of which we are aware. In addition, we have been served with a lawsuit seeking class certification in which the members of the purported class are seeking refunds and medical monitoring. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of Quebec. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining cases. We currently anticipate that trials in seven cases in the Eastern District of New York will begin in the second quarter of 2007. We have insurance coverage for a portion of our Zyprexa product liability claims exposure. The third party insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and are seeking to rescind the policies. The dispute is now the subject of litigation in the federal court in Indianapolis against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in Bermuda against other carriers. While we believe our position has merit, there can be no assurance that we will prevail. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. In the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a net pretax charge of $1.07 billion for product liability matters. The charge took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance coverage related to these matters. The charge covered the following: • The cost of the June 2005 Zyprexa settlements described above; and • Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the then-known and expected product liability claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. A substantial majority of those exposures and costs were related to then-known and expected Zyprexa claims. As a result of the January 2007 settlements discussed above, we incurred a pretax charge of $494.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The charge covered the following: • The cost of the January 2007 Zyprexa settlements; and • Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the then-known and expected Zyprexa product liability claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York. In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. In 2006, we were served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, West Virginia, New Mexico, and Mississippi in the courts of the respective states. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, -37- punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York in 2006 on similar grounds. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. We cannot predict with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. In addition, although we believe it is probable, there can be no assurance that the January 2007 Zyprexa product liability settlements described above will be concluded. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be largely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, as noted above, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims.

59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Review of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, significant business development, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 19 percent. This growth was primarily driven by volume increases in a number of key products, with a significant portion of this increase in volume resulting from the acquisition of ICOS. Our additional investments in marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta® and the diabetes care products, contributed to this sales growth and enabled us to increase our investment in research and development 11 percent in 2007. While cost of sales and operating expenses in the aggregate grew at approximately the same rate as sales, other income — net decreased and the effective tax rate increased. As a result, net income and earnings per share increased 11 percent, to $2.95 billion, or $2.71 per share, in 2007 as compared with $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006. Net income comparisons between 2007 and 2006 are affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results (see Notes 3, 4, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): 2007 • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $98.2 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.07. In the first quarter, we recognized similar charges associated with previously announced strategic decisions affecting manufacturing and research facilities of $123.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.08 (Note 4). • We incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of our insurance carriers over Zyprexa® product liability claims, which led to a reduction of our expected product liability insurance recoveries. This resulted in a charge of $81.3 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.06 in the third quarter (Notes 4 and 13). • We incurred in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges associated with our licensing arrangement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India of $45.0 million (pretax) and our licensing arrangement with MacroGenics, Inc., of $44.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.05 in the fourth quarter (Note 3). • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with the acquisition of Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), of $291.1 million (no tax benefit) and the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), of $37.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.29 in the second quarter (Note 3). • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with the acquisition of ICOS of $303.5 million (no tax benefit) and a licensing arrangement with OSI Pharmaceuticals of $25.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.29 in the first quarter (Note 3). 2006 • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $450.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.31 (Note 4). • In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge related to Zyprexa product liability litigation matters of $494.9 million (pretax), or $.42 per share (Notes 4 and 13). -17- Late-Stage Pipeline Developments and Business Development Activity Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We have achieved a number of successes with late-stage pipeline developments and recent business development transactions within the past year, including: Pipeline • On December 26, 2007, together with our collaboration partner Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, we submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for prasugrel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The proposed trademark for prasugrel is Effienttm. The submission follows the release of results of the TRITON TIMI-38 Phase III head-to-head study of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in November. • In January 2008, the FDA approved Cialis® for once-daily use to treat erectile dysfunction. Cialis was approved by the European Commission for once-daily use in June 2007. • In November, the FDA approved Cymbalta for the maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. In February, the FDA approved Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. During 2007, we submitted a Supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for Cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia. • In October, with our collaboration partners Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Alkermes, Inc., we announced positive results from a 30-week comparator study of once-weekly exenatide long-acting release injection and Byetta® (exenatide) injection taken twice daily in patients with type 2 diabetes. • In the second quarter, we submitted NDAs to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for approval of olanzapine (Zyprexa) long-acting injection. In late February 2008, the FDA issued a “not approvable” letter, stating it needs more information to better understand the risk and underlying cause of excessive sedation events that have been observed in about one percent of patients in clinical trials. -18- • In September, the FDA approved Evista® for a new use to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in two populations: postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer. • We submitted an application to the EMEA for centralized review of Alimta®, in combination with cisplatin, for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Business Development • In December, we entered into a licensing and development agreement with BioMS Medical Corp. whereby we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a multiple sclerosis (MS) compound. The compound is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase III clinical trials in secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and one Phase II clinical trial in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In connection with this agreement, we will incur a charge to earnings for acquired IPR&D of $87.0 million (pretax), which will be included as expense in the first quarter of 2008. • In October, we entered into an agreement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India whereby we acquired the rights to a portfolio of transient receptor potential vanilloid sub-family 1 (TRPV1) antagonist molecules, including a clinical-phase compound. The compound is currently in Phase II development as a potential next-generation treatment for various pain conditions, including osteoarthritic pain. • In October, we entered into a global strategic alliance with MacroGenics, Inc., to develop and commercialize teplizumab, a humanized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, as well as other potential next-generation anti-CD3 molecules for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. As part of the arrangement, we acquired the exclusive rights to the molecule. Teplizumab is currently being studied in the PROTÉGÉ trial, a global pivotal Phase II/III clinical trial for individuals with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. • In June, we completed the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, Inc., a privately held applied research and pharmaceutical product development company focused on the animal health industry. The acquisition provides us with product lines that complement those of our animal health business. • In April, we completed the acquisition of Hypnion, Inc., a privately held neuroscience drug discovery company focused on sleep disorders. The deal expands our presence in the area of sleep disorder research and provides ownership of a novel Phase II insomnia compound with a dual mechanism of action aimed at promoting better sleep onset and sleep maintenance. • In January, we completed the acquisition of ICOS at a cost of approximately $2.3 billion. The acquisition brings the full value of Cialis to us and enables us to realize operational efficiencies in the further development, marketing, and selling of this product. • In January, we licensed from OSI Pharmaceuticals its glucokinase activator (GKA) program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, including the lead compound. Lilly received an exclusive license to develop and market any compounds derived from the GKA program. Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters In October, the United States Supreme Court denied the petitions for certiorari that were filed by Teva Pharmaceuticals and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, bringing to an end the two companies’ challenges to the validity of Lilly’s U.S. Zyprexa patent. In June, we received notice of two court rulings by the Canadian Federal Court and the German Patent Court that permit the entry of generic olanzapine (Zyprexa) by competitors into the Canadian and German markets. Generic olanzapine is now available for sale by competitors in Canada and Germany. We have reached agreements with claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately 31,200 claims against us relating to the medication. Approximately 1,235 claims remain. As a result of our product liability exposures, since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of $1.61 billion for Zyprexa product liability matters. -19- In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA) that it had commenced an investigation relating to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa, Prozac®, and Prozac Weeklytm. In November 2007, we received a grand jury subpoena from the EDPA requesting documents related to Zyprexa. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) continues to effectively provide a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program (known as Medicare Part D). Various measures have been discussed and/or passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products, including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow, or require, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices within Medicare Part D directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to Medicaid patients. We expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to continue. In 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a final rule seeking to implement sections of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. This rule relates to the Medicaid program and among other things, sets out a methodology for the calculation and use of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price for pharmaceuticals. We have implemented the final rule, which has the effect of reducing net selling prices for Medicaid sales; however, we do not expect the impact to be material to our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. OPERATING RESULTS — 2007 Sales Our worldwide sales for 2007 increased 19 percent, to $18.63 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis since our January 29, 2007 acquisition of ICOS and sales growth of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar®, and Humalog®. Worldwide sales volume increased 12 percent, while selling prices and foreign exchange rates each increased sales by 3 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Sales in the U.S. increased 18 percent, to $10.15 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, and Byetta, and the inclusion of Cialis. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, to $8.49 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis, and sales growth of Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar, and Cymbalta. Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2007, driven by higher net selling prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder, increased 58 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by strong demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 70 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declining prices. -20- The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2007 compared with 2006: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2006 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,236.0 $ 2,525.0 $ 4,761.0 $ 4,363.6 9 Cymbalta 1,835.6 267.3 2,102.9 1,316.4 60 Gemzar 670.0 922.4 1,592.4 1,408.1 13 Humalog 888.0 586.6 1,474.6 1,299.5 13 Cialis2 423.8 720.0 1,143.8 215.8 NM Evista 706.1 384.6 1,090.7 1,045.3 4 Animal health products 480.9 514.9 995.8 875.5 14 Humulin® 365.2 620.0 985.2 925.3 6 Alimta 448.0 406.0 854.0 611.8 40 Forteo® 494.1 215.2 709.3 594.3 19 Strattera® 464.6 104.8 569.4 579.0 (2 ) Humatrope® 213.6 227.2 440.8 415.6 6 Actos® 150.8 219.8 370.6 448.5 (17 ) Byetta 316.5 14.2 330.7 219.0 51 Other pharmaceutical products 452.3 760.0 1,212.3 1,373.3 (12 ) Total net sales $ 10,145.5 $ 8,488.0 $ 18,633.5 $ 15,691.0 19 NM — Not meaningful 1 U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 2 Prior to the acquisition of ICOS, the Cialis sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we marketed Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other income — net in our consolidated income statement. Subsequent to the acquisition, all Cialis product sales are reported in our net sales. -21- Total worldwide sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction, were $1.22 billion and $971.0 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly ICOS joint-venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the acquisition of ICOS. Worldwide sales grew 25 percent in 2007. U.S. sales increased 20 percent in 2007, driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 28 percent in 2007, driven by increased demand, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher prices. Prior to the ICOS acquisition, Cialis sales in our territories were reported in net sales, while our 50 percent share of the joint-venture net income was reported in other income — net. All sales of Cialis subsequent to the ICOS acquisition are reported in our net sales. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices and lower demand. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Alimta, a second-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer and in combination with another agent, for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma, increased 28 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 55 percent, driven by increased demand and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture, increased 19 percent in the U.S., driven by higher net selling prices. U.S. sales growth benefited from access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D program and decreased utilization of our U.S. patient assistance program and to a lesser extent, increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 21 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. -22- Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, decreased 9 percent in the U.S., as a result of decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Our revenues from Actos, an oral agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, a portion of which represent revenues from a copromotion agreement in the U.S. with Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (Takeda), decreased 46 percent in the U.S. Actos is manufactured by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., and sold in the U.S. by Takeda. Our U.S. marketing rights with respect to Actos expired in September 2006; however, we continue to receive royalties from Takeda through September 2009 at rates that decline each year. Our arrangement outside the U.S. continues. Sales outside the U.S. increased 30 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Worldwide sales of Byetta, an injectable product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which we market with Amylin Pharmaceuticals (Amylin), increased 51 percent to $650.2 million during 2007. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S., 100 percent of Byetta sales outside the U.S., and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Our revenues increased 51 percent to $330.7 million in 2007. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 18 percent, driven by increased demand, the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, and new companion-animal product launches. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2007 gross margin decreased to 77.2 percent of sales compared with 77.4 percent for 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the ICOS acquisition, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and production volumes growing at a slower rate than sales, offset partially by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses) increased 19 percent in 2007. Investment in research and development increased 11 percent, to $3.49 billion. In addition to the acquisition of ICOS, this increase was due to increases in discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing -23- approximately 19 percent of our sales into research and development during 2007. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 25 percent in 2007, to $6.10 billion. This increase was largely due to the impact of the ICOS acquisition, as well as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Acquired IPR&D charges were $745.6 million in 2007 and related to the acquisitions of ICOS, Hypnion, and Ivy, as well as our licensing arrangements with OSI, MacroGenics, and Glenmark. We incurred asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $302.5 million in 2007 as compared to $945.2 million in 2006. See Notes 3, 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other income — net decreased $115.8 million, to $122.0 million. This line item consists of interest expense, interest income, the after-tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items. • Interest expense for 2007 decreased $9.8 million, to $228.3 million. This decrease is a result of lower average debt balances in 2007 compared to 2006. • Interest income for 2007 decreased $46.6 million, to $215.3 million, due to lower cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006. • The Lilly ICOS joint-venture income was $11.0 million in 2007 as compared to $96.3 million in 2006, due to the acquisition of ICOS on January 29, 2007. • Net other miscellaneous income items increased $6.3 million to $124.0 million. We incurred tax expense of $923.8 million in 2007, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.8 percent, compared with 22.1 percent for 2006. The effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were affected primarily by the nondeductible ICOS and Hypnion IPR&D charges of $594.6 million in 2007, and the product liability charges of $494.9 million in 2006. The tax effect of the product liability charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. -24- OPERATING RESULTS — 2006 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 7 percent, primarily as a result of strong growth of our newer products. We increased our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and continued our commitment to research and development, investing approximately 20 percent of our sales during 2006. Our results also benefited from continued growth in profitability of the Lilly ICOS joint venture as well as cost-containment and productivity initiatives. Net income was $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006 as compared with $1.98 billion, or $1.81 per share, in 2005, representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of 35 percent. Certain items, reflected in our operating results for 2006 and 2005, should be considered in comparing the two years. The significant items for 2006 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2005 items are summarized as follows (see Notes 2, 4, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): • We incurred a charge related to product liability litigation matters, primarily related to Zyprexa, of $1.07 billion (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.90 in the second quarter (Notes 4 and 13). • We recognized asset impairments and other special charges of $171.9 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.14 (Note 4). • We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, in the fourth quarter. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $22.0 million (after-tax), which decreased earnings per share by $.02 (Note 2). Sales Our worldwide sales for 2006 increased 7 percent, to $15.69 billion, driven primarily by sales growth of Cymbalta, Forteo, Byetta, Zyprexa, and Alimta. Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent, and selling prices increased sales by 4 percent. Foreign exchange rates did not impact our overall sales growth. Sales in the U.S. increased 10 percent, to $8.60 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, diabetes care products, Forteo, and Zyprexa. U.S. growth comparisons benefited from an estimated $170 million of wholesaler destocking that had occurred in 2005 as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in the first quarter of 2005. Additionally, we experienced a sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain low-income patients from Medicaid to Medicare and increased access to medical coverage by certain patients previously covered under our LillyAnswers® program following the implementation of MMA in 2006. This contributed part of the increases in U.S. net effective sales prices of 9 percent. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, to $7.09 billion, driven by growth of Cymbalta, Alimta, and Zyprexa. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 4 percent in 2006, driven by higher prices, offset in part by lower demand. The increase in net selling prices was partially due to the transition of certain low-income patients from Medicaid to Medicare. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent, driven primarily by increased demand, offset in part by declining prices. Diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of $2.96 billion in 2006, an increase of 6 percent. Diabetes care revenues in the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $1.73 billion. Diabetes care revenues outside the U.S. increased 2 percent, to $1.23 billion. Results from our primary diabetes care products are as follows: • Humalog sales increased 10 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices, and increased 7 percent outside the U.S., due primarily to increased volume, offset partially by lower prices. • Humulin sales in the U.S. decreased 10 percent due primarily to decreased volume, offset partially by increased selling prices. Outside the U.S., Humulin sales decreased 6 percent due to decreases in demand and selling prices. -25- • Actos revenues in the U.S. decreased 22 percent in 2006, due to the expiration of our U.S. marketing rights in September 2006. Sales outside the U.S. increased 23 percent, due primarily to increased volume in addition to a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset in part by lower prices. • Total sales of Byetta, launched in the U.S. in June 2005, were $430.2 million for 2006. Sales of Gemzar increased 4 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels in 2005. Gemzar sales increased 7 percent outside the U.S., driven by strong volume. Sales of Cymbalta increased 82 percent in the U.S., due to strong demand. Sales of Cymbalta outside the U.S. reflect international launches. Sales of Evista increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices, offset partially by a decline in demand. Outside the U.S., sales of Evista decreased 1 percent, driven by lower prices, offset by an increase in demand. The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2006 compared with 2005: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2005 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,106.2 $ 2,257.4 $ 4,363.6 $ 4,202.3 4 Gemzar 609.8 798.3 1,408.1 1,334.5 6 Cymbalta 1,158.7 157.7 1,316.4 679.7 94 Humalog 811.0 488.5 1,299.5 1,197.7 9 Evista 664.0 381.3 1,045.3 1,036.1 1 Humulin 367.9 557.4 925.3 1,004.7 (8 ) Animal health products 405.9 469.6 875.5 863.7 1 Alimta 350.1 261.7 611.8 463.2 32 Forteo 416.2 178.1 594.3 389.3 53 Strattera 509.2 69.8 579.0 552.1 5 Actos 279.1 169.4 448.5 493.0 (9 ) Humatrope 202.3 213.3 415.6 414.4 0 Byetta 219.0 — 219.0 39.6 NM Cialis2 3.7 212.1 215.8 169.9 27 Other pharmaceutical products 496.1 877.2 1,373.3 1,805.1 (24 ) Total net sales $ 8,599.2 $ 7,091.8 $ 15,691.0 $ 14,645.3 7 NM — Not meaningful 1 U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 2 Cialis had worldwide 2006 sales of $971.0 million, representing an increase of 30 percent compared with 2005. The sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we marketed Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other income — net in our consolidated statements of income. Sales of Alimta increased 18 percent and 57 percent in the U.S. and outside the U.S., respectively, due primarily to increased demand. Sales of Forteo increased 57 percent in the U.S. In addition to increased demand, U.S. sales significantly benefited from patients’ access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D program and from decreased utilization of our U.S. patient assistance program, LillyAnswers. Sales outside the U.S. increased 43 percent, reflecting strong demand. -26- Sales of Strattera increased 2 percent in the U.S. due to higher prices as well as the reductions in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels in 2005, offset by a decline in demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 31 percent due primarily to increased demand in addition to a modest favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset partially by lower prices. Total product sales of Cialis increased 38 percent in the U.S. and 24 percent outside the U.S. Worldwide Cialis sales growth reflects the impact of market share gains, market growth, and price increases during 2006. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 10 percent, due primarily to increased demand led by Rumensin® and Tylan®. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 5 percent, driven primarily by the decrease in the sales of Surmax® as a result of the European Union’s growth promotion use ban on the product, effective January 1, 2006. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2006 gross margin increased to 77.4 percent of sales compared with 76.3 percent for 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased product prices and increased production volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses. Operating expenses increased 7 percent in 2006. Investment in research and development increased 3 percent, to $3.13 billion, primarily due to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs. We continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately 20 percent of our sales into research and development during 2006. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2006, to $4.89 billion. This increase was largely attributable to increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care franchise, and an increase in litigation-related costs. Other income — net decreased $76.4 million, to $237.8 million. • Interest expense for 2006 increased $132.9 million, to $238.1 million. This increase was a result of higher interest rates and less capitalized interest due to the completion in late 2005 of certain manufacturing facilities. • Interest income for 2006 increased $49.8 million, to $261.9 million, due to higher short-term interest rates. • The Lilly ICOS joint-venture income was $96.3 million in 2006 as compared to $11.1 million in 2005. The increase was due to increased Cialis sales and decreased selling and marketing expenses. • Net other miscellaneous income items decreased $78.5 million, to $117.7 million, primarily as a result of less income related to the outlicensing of legacy products and partnered compounds in development. We incurred tax expense of $755.3 million in 2006, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.1 percent, compared with 26.3 percent for 2005. The effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were affected primarily by the product liability charges of $494.9 million and $1.07 billion, respectively. The tax benefit associated with these charges was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $4.83 billion compared with $3.89 billion at December 31, 2006. Cash flow from operations in 2007 of $5.15 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $1.45 billion exceeded the total of the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of $2.67 billion, dividends paid of $1.85 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $1.08 billion. Capital expenditures of $1.08 billion during 2007 were consistent with 2006, due primarily to the management of capital spending. We expect near-term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as 2007 levels while we invest in our biotech and research and development initiatives, continue to upgrade our -27- manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems, and invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes care products. Total debt as of December 31, 2007 increased $1.29 billion, to $5.01 billion, reflecting the $2.50 billion of debt we issued in 2007 to finance our acquisition of ICOS, offset by long-term debt repayment of $1.06 billion. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s remain at AA and Aa3, respectively. Dividends of $1.70 per share were paid in 2007, an increase of 6 percent from 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2007, effective for the first-quarter dividend in 2008, the quarterly dividend was increased to $.47 per share (a 10.6 percent increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2008 of $1.88 per share. The year 2007 was the 123rd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 40th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, costs associated with product liability litigation, dividends, and taxes in 2008. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowings, if necessary. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent illiquidity in the market. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2008 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. -28- In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2007 and 2006, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. -29- Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and partner assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. The inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur, as the failure rate for products in development is very high. In addition, these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt, including interest payments1 $ 9,582.3 $ 645.6 $ 522.4 $ 1,000.7 $ 7,413.6 Capital lease obligations 72.5 15.5 20.3 5.8 30.9 Operating leases 305.4 93.7 129.5 76.2 6.0 Purchase obligations2 5,101.7 4,575.5 330.3 149.7 46.2 Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 829.3 — 154.3 159.7 515.3 Other4 146.3 146.3 — — — Total $ 16,037.5 $ 5,476.6 $ 1,156.8 $ 1,392.1 $ 8,012.0 1 Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2007 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: • Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2007. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. • Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included our long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.57 billion are excluded as reasonable estimates could not be made regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities. 4 This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. -30- The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2007. The amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than 90 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. An unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the U.S. could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. As a result of restructuring our arrangements with our U.S. wholesalers in early 2005, reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products (primarily Strattera, Prozac, and Gemzar) that reduced our 2005 sales by approximately $170 million. The modified structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our U.S. wholesalers. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns, which have been approximately 1 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate/discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales rebates/discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term-care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate/discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate/discount contracts. The largest of our sales rebate/discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid -31- recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate/discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Due to the time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid) and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $642.1 million, $571.7 million, and $637.1 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. A 5 percent change in the Medicaid and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2007 would lead to an approximate $32 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2007, our Medicaid and Medicare rebate liability was $308.8 million. Approximately 75 percent and 85 percent of our global rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. rebate and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2007 2006 Rebate and discount liability, beginning of year $ 383.3 $ 379.4 Reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates1 1,314.1 1,246.1 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (1,228.6 ) (1,242.2 ) Rebate and discount liability, end of year $ 468.8 $ 383.3 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial position of the insurers, and the possibility of and the length of time for collection. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. -32- Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets and the health-care-cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 85 percent to 95 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company-specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2007 annual expense would increase by approximately $28 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2007 service cost and interest cost by approximately $23 million. If the 2007 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $32 million. If the 2007 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $14 million. If our assumption regarding the 2007 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately $31 million. The U.S. plans represent approximately 80 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 83 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2007. Impairment of Long-lived Assets We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of -33- an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately $78 million and $26 million, respectively. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2008 For the full year of 2008, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.80 to $3.95. This guidance includes the anticipated acquired in-process research and development charges of $.05 related to the BioMS in-licensing agreement. We expect sales to grow in the mid-to high-single digits, driven primarily by increased volume and strong sales growth for Cymbalta, Cialis, Byetta, Alimta, and Humalog. We expect modest improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales, driven primarily by manufacturing expenses growing more slowly than sales. In addition, we expect operating expenses to grow more slowly than sales in 2008, with growth in the mid-single digits. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to grow in the low-single digits, driven by investments in prasugrel, Cymbalta, Evista for invasive breast cancer risk reduction, Humalog, and Byetta, offset by decreases in other areas. Research and development expenses are expected to grow in the high-single to low-double digits. Other income — net is expected to contribute less than $100 million. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23 percent. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in-process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates; changes in effective tax rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, and government investigations; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): • Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr), submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in 2002 seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring -34- in 2012-2017) and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a similar lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The lawsuit against Teva is currently scheduled for trial beginning March 9, 2009, while no trial date has been set in the lawsuit against Barr. We believe that Barr’s and Teva’s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. • Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (Mayne), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) each submitted ANDAs seeking permission to market generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and method-of-use patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these patents are invalid. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Sicor (February 2006) and Mayne (October 2006), seeking rulings that these patents are valid and are being infringed. In November 2007, the lawsuit against Mayne was stayed and administratively closed by the court. Also in November 2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking a ruling that our method-of-use patent is invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by the sale of Sun’s generic product. Sun informed us in December 2007 that it is also challenging our compound patent, and that patent has now been added to the declaratory judgment action. In January 2008, we filed a second lawsuit against Mayne in response to a second ANDA filed by Mayne for a new dosage strength. We expect to prevail in this litigation and believe that these claims are without merit. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. • Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis), Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA (Glenmark), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), Apotex Inc. (Apotex), Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Synthon Laboratories, Inc. (Synthon), and Zydus Pharmaceuticals, USA, Inc. (Zydus) each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patent (expiring in 2017), and alleging that this patent is invalid. We filed a lawsuit against Actavis in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in August 2007. Sandoz filed a declaratory judgment action in the same court, but its case has been dismissed. In September 2007, we amended the complaint in the New Jersey lawsuit to add Glenmark, Sun, Sandoz, Mylan, Teva, Apotex, Aurobindo, Synthon, and Zydus as defendants. We filed a second action against Synthon in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Synthon has filed a motion to dismiss our lawsuit in New Jersey. In December 2007, Zydus agreed to entry of a consent judgment in which Zydus conceded the validity and enforceability of the patent and agreed to a permanent injunction. We expect to prevail in this litigation and believe that these claims are without merit. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the U.S.: • In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In April 2007, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and Apotex has appealed that ruling. In June 2007, the Canadian Federal Court held that the invalidity allegations of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), were justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We have appealed that decision and sued Novopharm for patent infringement. The appeal was dismissed. In November 2007, Apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of the invalidity of -35- our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patents (expiring in 2011). The trial court ruled in our favor in February 2007. Apotex will likely appeal. • In Germany, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers Egis-Gyogyszergyar and Neolabs Ltd. challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patents (expiring in 2011). In June 2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that our patent is invalid. We are appealing the decision. Generic olanzapine was launched by competitors in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2007. • We have received challenges in a number of other countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and several smaller European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers’ challenge, but we anticipate further legal challenges from generic manufacturers. In the U.K., a trial date has tentatively been set for July 2008. We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our Zyprexa patents on a country-by-country basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The availability of generic olanzapine in Canada and Germany will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. The availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. In June 2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris® and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products. On May 4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $65 million in damages, calculated by applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held in August 2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes. In June 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) commenced a reexamination of the patent, and in August 2007 took the position that the Ariad claims at issue are unpatentable, a position that Ariad continues to contest. In September 2007, the Court entered a final judgment indicating that Ariad’s claims are patentable, valid, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65 million plus a 2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted. We plan to appeal this judgment. We believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote. Government Investigations and Related Litigation In March 2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA) advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly. In November 2007, we received a grand jury subpoena from the EDPA for a broad range of documents related to Zyprexa. A number of State Medicaid Fraud Control Units are coordinating with the EDPA in its investigation of any Medicaid-related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of Zyprexa. In October 2005, the EDPA advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering Axid®, Evista, Humalog, Humulin, Prozac, and Zyprexa. The inquiry includes a review of our Medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. -36- In September 2006, we received a subpoena from the California Attorney General’s Office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexa’s status on California’s formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and remuneration of health care providers. In February 2007, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois, seeking production of documents and information relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa. Beginning in August 2006, we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws. Most of these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. We are aware that approximately 30 states are participating in this joint effort, and it is possible that additional states will join the investigation. These attorneys general are seeking a broad range of Zyprexa documents, including documents relating to sales, marketing and promotional practices, and remuneration of health care providers. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in a private suit in California State Court, which was removed to federal court, alleging violations of the California False Claims Act with respect to certain Zyprexa marketing and promotional practices. This suit was brought by an individual on behalf of the government, under the qui tam provision of the California False Claims Act. We are cooperating in each of these investigations, including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations. It is possible that other Lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies. We cannot determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome. It is possible, however, that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance-related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices, physician communications, remuneration of health care professionals, managed care arrangements, and Medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations. Product Liability and Related Litigation We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the United States and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 31,200 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows: • In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000 claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover administration of the settlement. • In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs’ attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for approximately $500 million. The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during 2005. The January 2007 settlements were paid during 2007. -37- We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 325 lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 1,235 plaintiffs. Trial dates have been set for June 23, 2008, in the Eastern District of New York, for several of the U.S. plaintiffs. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes all Canadian residents, except for residents of Quebec and British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S. We have insurance coverage for a portion of our Zyprexa product liability claims exposure. The third-party insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and are seeking to rescind the policies. The dispute was the subject of litigation in the federal court in Indianapolis against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in Bermuda against other carriers. In the second half of 2007, we reached settlements resolving the vast majority of the disputed insurance claims, and a portion of the insurance proceeds were paid to us prior to the end of 2007. Since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of $1.61 billion for Zyprexa product liability matters. The net charges, which take into account our actual and expected insurance recoveries, covered the following: • The cost of the Zyprexa product liability settlements to date; and • Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the known Zyprexa product liability claims and expected future claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York. In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. We have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia in the courts of the respective states. The Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York. The Alaska case is scheduled for trial beginning March 3, 2008. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York in 2006 on similar grounds. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. -38- Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be largely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, as noted above, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims.

59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Review of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, significant business development, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 9 percent, which was primarily driven by volume increases in several key products. The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales contributed to an improvement in gross margin. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew at the same rate as sales, driven by pre-launch activities associated with prasugrel, marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista, the impact of foreign exchange rates, and increased litigation-related expenses; while our investment in research and development grew 10 percent. We completed our acquisition of ImClone Systems Inc. (ImClone), resulting in a significant charge of $4.69 billion for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) and reached resolution on government investigations related to our past U.S. marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa, resulting in an additional charge of $1.48 billion. We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million, despite a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion, primarily caused by the non-deductibility of the ImClone IPR&D charge and the partial deductibility of the Zyprexa investigation settlements. Accordingly, earnings decreased $5.02 billion, to a net loss of $2.07 billion, and earnings per share decreased $4.60, to a loss of $1.89 per share, in 2008 as compared with net income of $2.95 billion, or earnings per share of $2.71 in 2007. Net income comparisons between 2008 and 2007 are affected by the impact of the following significant items (see Notes 3, 5, 12, and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): 2008 Acquisitions (Note 3) • We recognized charges totaling $4.73 billion (pretax) associated with the acquisition of ImClone, which decreased earnings per share by $4.46. These amounts include an IPR&D charge of $4.69 billion (pretax). The remaining net expenses are related to ImClone’s operating results subsequent to the acquisition, incremental interest costs, and amortization of the intangible asset associated with Erbitux. We also incurred IPR&D charges of $28.0 million (pretax) associated with the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SGX), which decreased earnings per share by $.03. • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with licensing arrangements with BioMS Medical Corp. (BioMS) and TransPharma Medical Ltd. totaling $122.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.07. -19- Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 14) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges totaling $497.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.30. A similar charge of $57.1 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.04, was included in cost of sales. These charges were primarily associated with the sale of our Greenfield, Indiana site, the termination of the AIR® Insulin program, and strategic exit activities related to manufacturing operations. • We recorded charges of $1.48 billion (pretax) related to the federal and state Zyprexa investigations led by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA), as well as the resolution of a multi-state investigation regarding Zyprexa involving 32 states and the District of Columbia, which decreased earnings per share by $1.20. Other (Note 12) • We recognized a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million as a result of the resolution of a substantial portion of the IRS audit of our federal income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, which increased earnings per share by $.19. 2007 Acquisitions (Note 3) • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with the acquisitions of ICOS Corporation (ICOS), Hypnion, Inc. (Hypnion), and Ivy Animal Health, Inc. (Ivy), totaling $631.6 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.57. • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with our licensing arrangements with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India, MacroGenics, Inc., and OSI Pharmaceuticals, totaling $114.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.06. -20- Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 14) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $190.6 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.12. These charges were primarily associated with previously announced strategic decisions affecting manufacturing and research facilities. • We incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of our insurance carriers over Zyprexa product liability claims, which led to a reduction of our expected product liability insurance recoveries, and other product liability charges. This resulted in a charge totaling $111.9 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.09. Late-Stage Pipeline Developments and Business Development Activity Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotech-nology or pharmaceutical companies. There were a number of late-stage pipeline developments and business development transactions within the past year, including: Pipeline • We, along with our partner Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, are seeking from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for prasugrel as a treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome being managed with percutaneous coronary intervention. The Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA reviewed prasugrel during a hearing and unanimously recommended it for approval. The FDA will consider the recommendation as it continues its review and makes its final decision. • Prasugrel was approved for marketing by the European Commission under the trade name Efient in February 2009 for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. • We received a complete response letter from the FDA for olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI) for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults. We are continuing to work with the agency on the new drug application (NDA). The FDA does not require any additional clinical trials for the continued review of the NDA. Per the agency’s request, we are preparing a proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which will be submitted in the near future. In addition, olanzapine long-acting injection was approved by the European Commission under the trade name Zypadheratm. • We withdrew our supplemental NDA from the FDA for Cymbalta for the management of chronic pain. We plan to resubmit the application in the first half of 2009, adding data from a recently completed study in chronic osteoarthritis pain of the knee. • The FDA approved Alimta, in combination with cisplatin, as a first-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with nonsquamous histology. The European health authorities also approved Alimta, in combination with cisplatin, as a first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients with other than predominantly squamous cell histology. • We submitted tadalafil as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. • The FDA approved Cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder. In addition, the European Commission approved Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). • We, along with our partner Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin), submitted Byetta as a monotherapy treatment for type 2 diabetes to the FDA. • The European Commission approved a new indication for Forsteo® for the treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained, systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and men at increased risk for fracture. We have also received an approvable letter from the FDA for Forteo for the same indication. -21- • We terminated development of our AIR Insulin program, which was being conducted in collaboration with Alkermes, Inc. The program had been in Phase III clinical development as a potential treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This decision was not a result of any observations during AIR Insulin trials relating to the safety of the product, but rather was a result of increasing uncertainties in the regulatory environment and a thorough evaluation of the evolving commercial and clinical potential of the product compared to existing medical therapies. Business Development • We acquired all of the outstanding shares of ImClone for a total purchase price of approximately $6.5 billion. This strategic combination will offer both targeted therapies and oncolytic agents along with an oncology pipeline spanning all phases of clinical development. It also expands our biotechnology capabilities. • We entered into a license and a supply arrangement with United Therapeutics Corporation related to the U.S. commercialization rights for the PAH indication of tadalafil. We received an upfront payment of $150.0 million in exchange for exclusive rights to commercialize tadalafil for PAH in the U.S., as well as for a product manufacturing and supply arrangement. As part of this arrangement, we acquired a $150.0 million equity position in the company. The indication is currently under review by the FDA. • We acquired the worldwide rights to the dairy cow supplement Posilac, as well as the product’s supporting operations, from Monsanto Company (Monsanto) for an upfront payment of $300.0 million, as well as contingent consideration based on future Posilac sales. The acquisition of Posilac provides us with a product that complements those of our animal health product line. • We sold our Greenfield Laboratories site in Greenfield, Indiana, to Covance Inc. We also signed a 10-year service agreement, under which Covance will assume responsibility for our toxicology testing and other R&D support activities at the site. • We acquired SGX for approximately $64 million in cash. The acquisition allows us to integrate SGX’s structure-guided drug discovery platform into our drug discovery efforts. It also gives us access to FASTtm, SGX’s fragment-based, protein structure guided drug discovery technology, and to a portfolio of preclinical oncology compounds focused on a number of kinase targets. • We entered into a licensing and development agreement with TransPharma Medical Ltd. (TransPharma) to acquire rights to its product and related drug delivery system for the treatment of osteoporosis. The product, which is administered transdermally using TransPharma’s proprietary technology, is currently in Phase II clinical testing. • We entered into an agreement with an affiliate of TPG-Axon Capital (TPG) for the Phase III development of our two lead molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. This agreement provides TPG with success-based milestones and royalties in exchange for clinical trial funding. • We entered into a licensing and development agreement with BioMS whereby we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a multiple sclerosis (MS) compound. The compound is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase III clinical trials in secondary progressive MS. Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters In March 2004, we were notified by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the EDPA that it had commenced an investigation relating to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices for Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weeklytm. In October 2008, we announced that we were in advanced discussions to resolve the ongoing investigations led by the EDPA, and we recorded a charge of $1.42 billion. In January 2009, we announced that the discussions had been successfully concluded, and that we settled the Zyprexa-related federal claims, as well as similar Medicaid-related claims of states which decide to participate in the settlement. Beginning in August 2006, we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws seeking documents pertaining to Zyprexa. In -22- October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia, under which we paid $62.0 million. In December 2008, the Federal Supreme Court (BGH) in Germany re-established our Zyprexa patent that had been declared invalid in 2007 by the German Federal Patent Court. As a result of this ruling, generic olanzapine has been withdrawn from the German market as of the beginning of 2009. We continue to reach agreements with claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle claims against us relating to the medication. Approximately 120 claims remain. In the third quarter of 2008, we initiated a strategic review of our Tippecanoe manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana. Options being considered for this site include continuing operations with a revised site mission, exploring opportunities to sell the facility, and ceasing operations altogether. The review is expected to last six to twelve months. No final decisions have been made at this time; however, depending on the decision, we could record significant charges. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) continues to provide an effective prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program (known as Medicare Part D). Various measures have been discussed and/or passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products, including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow, or require, the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices within Medicare Part D directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to Medicaid patients or impose additional rebates on sales to patients who receive their medicines through Medicare Part D. Uncertainty exists surrounding the new administration and Congress and the impact any government decisions or programs will have on the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, many states are facing substantial budget difficulties due to the downturn in the economy and are expected to seek aggressive cuts or other offsets in healthcare spending. We expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to become more severe, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2008 compared with 2007: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, Percent December 31, 2008 2007 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2007 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,202.5 $ 2,493.6 $ 4,696.1 $ 4,761.0 (1 ) Cymbalta 2,253.8 443.3 2,697.1 2,102.9 28 Humalog 1,008.4 727.4 1,735.8 1,474.6 18 Gemzar 734.8 985.0 1,719.8 1,592.4 8 Cialis2 539.0 905.5 1,444.5 1,143.8 26 Alimta 561.9 592.8 1,154.7 854.0 35 Animal health products 537.3 556.0 1,093.3 995.8 10 Evista 700.5 375.1 1,075.6 1,090.7 (1 ) Humulin 380.9 682.3 1,063.2 985.2 8 Forteo 489.9 288.8 778.7 709.3 10 Strattera 437.8 141.7 579.5 569.4 2 Other pharmaceutical products 1,087.6 1,252.1 2,339.7 2,354.4 (1 ) Total net sales $ 10,934.4 $ 9,443.6 $ 20,378.0 $ 18,633.5 9 1 U.S. sales include sales in Puerto Rico. -23- 2 Prior to the acquisition of ICOS in late January 2007, the Cialis sales shown do not include sales in the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory sales for January 2007, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other — net in our consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the acquisition, all Cialis product sales are reported in our net sales. Worldwide 2008 sales for Cialis grew 19 percent from 2007 sales of $1.22 billion. OPERATING RESULTS — 2008 Sales Our worldwide sales for 2008 increased 9 percent, to $20.38 billion, driven primarily by growth of Cymbalta, Cialis, Alimta, Humalog, and Gemzar. Worldwide sales volume increased 5 percent, while foreign exchange rates contributed 3 percent, and selling prices contributed 2 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Sales in the U.S. increased 8 percent, to $10.93 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, and Alimta. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $9.44 billion, driven primarily by the sales growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, and Humalog. Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 1 percent in 2008, driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 1 percent, driven by decreased demand and to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic competition in Germany and Canada. As noted previously, generic olanzapine has been withdrawn from the German market as of the beginning of 2009. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia, increased 23 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 66 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices. Higher demand outside the U.S. reflects increased demand in established markets as well as recent launches in new markets. Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 24 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. -24- Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to fight various cancers, increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. We will likely face increased generic competition in certain markets outside the U.S. in 2009. Our sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction, increased 27 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 26 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices. Total worldwide sales of Cialis increased 19 percent to $1.44 billion in 2008 as compared to $1.22 billion in 2007. This includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly ICOS joint-venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the acquisition of ICOS. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 46 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by lower demand and lower prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. As described in Legal and Regulatory Matters, Evista is the subject of a Hatch-Waxman patent challenge by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), which has received tentative approval of its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) from the FDA. Unless the current stay on Teva’s approved ANDA remains in force or Teva is preliminarily enjoined from markets if the stay is lifted, it is possible that Teva could choose to launch before the current action against Teva is concluded. Such a launch could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture, decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 34 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults, decreased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by decreased demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 35 percent, driven primarily by increased demand. Worldwide sales of Byetta, an injectable product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that we market with Amylin, increased 16 percent to $751.4 million during 2008. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S., 100 percent of Byetta sales outside the U.S., and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Our revenues increased 20 percent to $396.1 million in 2008. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by the inclusion of U.S. Posilac sales since the date of acquisition. Sales outside the U.S. increased 8 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2008 gross margin increased to 78.5 percent of sales compared with 77.2 percent for 2007. This increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. -25- Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in 2008, to $6.63 billion. This increase was due to increased marketing and selling expenses, including prelaunch expenses for prasugrel and marketing costs associated with Cymbalta and Evista; the impact of foreign exchange rates; and increased litigation-related expenses. Investment in research and development increased 10 percent, to $3.84 billion, due to increased late-stage clinical trial and discovery research costs. Acquired IPR&D charges related to the acquisitions of ImClone and SGX, as well as our in-licensing arrangements with BioMS and TransPharma, were $4.84 billion in 2008 as compared to $745.6 million in -26- 2007. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $1.97 billion in 2008, as compared to $302.5 million in 2007. The 2008 charges were primarily associated with the resolution of Zyprexa investigations with the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA and multiple states. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other — net decreased $148.1 million, to a net expense of $26.1 million. This line item consists of interest expense, interest income, the after-tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items. • Interest expense for 2008 was essentially flat at $228.3 million. The impact of lower interest rates on our debt was substantially offset by lower capitalized interest due to lower construction-in-progress balances and increased interest expense due to the financing of the ImClone acquisition. • Interest income for 2008 decreased $4.6 million, to $210.7 million, as lower interest rates were partially offset by higher cash balances. • The Lilly ICOS joint venture income prior to the 2007 acquisition was $11.0 million. Subsequent to the acquisition, all activity related to ICOS is included in our consolidated financial results. • Net other miscellaneous items decreased $132.5 million to a loss of $8.5 million, primarily as a result of lower outlicensing income and increased net losses on investment securities in 2008 (the majority of which consisted of unrealized losses). We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net loss was driven by the $4.69 billion acquired IPR&D charge for ImClone and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa investigation settlements. The IPR&D charge was not tax deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of the IRS audit. The effective tax rate was 23.8 percent in 2007. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. OPERATING RESULTS — 2007 Financial Results We achieved worldwide sales growth of 19 percent. This growth was primarily driven by volume increases in a number of key products, with a significant portion of this increase in volume resulting from the acquisition of ICOS. Our additional investments in marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, contributed to this sales growth and enabled us to increase our investment in research and development 11 percent in 2007. While cost of sales and operating expenses in the aggregate grew at approximately the same rate as sales, other — net decreased and the effective tax rate increased. As a result, net income and earnings per share increased 11 percent, to $2.95 billion, or $2.71 per share, in 2007 as compared with $2.66 billion, or $2.45 per share, in 2006. Net income comparisons between 2007 and 2006 are affected by the impact of significant items that are reflected in our financial results. The significant items for 2007 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2006 items are summarized as follows (see Notes 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information): • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $450.3 million (pretax) in the fourth quarter, which decreased earnings per share by $.31 (Note 5). • In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge related to Zyprexa product liability litigation matters of $494.9 million (pretax), or $.42 per share (Notes 5 and 14). Sales Our worldwide sales for 2007 increased 19 percent, to $18.63 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis since our January 29, 2007 acquisition of ICOS and sales growth of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar, and Humalog. Worldwide sales volume increased 12 percent, while selling prices and foreign -27- exchange rates each increased sales by 3 percent. (Numbers do not add due to rounding.) Sales in the U.S. increased 18 percent, to $10.15 billion, driven primarily by increased sales of Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Alimta, and Byetta, and the inclusion of Cialis. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, to $8.49 billion, driven primarily by the inclusion of Cialis, and sales growth of Zyprexa, Alimta, Gemzar, and Cymbalta. The following table summarizes our net sales activity in 2007 compared with 2006: Year Ended Year Ended Percent December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Change Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total Total from 2006 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,236.0 $ 2,525.0 $ 4,761.0 $ 4,363.6 9 Cymbalta 1,835.6 267.3 2,102.9 1,316.4 60 Gemzar 670.0 922.4 1,592.4 1,408.1 13 Humalog 888.0 586.6 1,474.6 1,299.5 13 Cialis2 423.8 720.0 1,143.8 215.8 NM Evista 706.1 384.6 1,090.7 1,045.3 4 Animal health products 480.9 514.9 995.8 875.5 14 Humulin 365.2 620.0 985.2 925.3 6 Alimta 448.0 406.0 854.0 611.8 40 Forteo 494.1 215.2 709.3 594.3 19 Strattera 464.6 104.8 569.4 579.0 (2 ) Humatrope 213.6 227.2 440.8 415.6 6 Actos 150.8 219.8 370.6 448.5 (17 ) Byetta 316.5 14.2 330.7 219.0 51 Other pharmaceutical products 452.3 760.0 1,212.3 1,373.3 (12 ) Total net sales $ 10,145.5 $ 8,488.0 $ 18,633.5 $ 15,691.0 19 NM — Not meaningful 1 U.S sales include sales in Puerto Rico. 2 Prior to the acquisition of ICOS, the Cialis sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we marketed Cialis exclusively. The remaining sales relate to the joint-venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North America, excluding Puerto Rico, and Europe). Our share of the joint-venture territory sales, net of expenses and income taxes, is reported in other — net in our consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the acquisition, all Cialis product sales are reported in our net sales. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2007, driven by higher net selling prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Sales of Cymbalta increased 58 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by strong demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 70 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Gemzar increased 10 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Humalog increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declining prices. Total worldwide sales of Cialis were $1.22 billion and $971.0 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This includes $72.7 million of sales in the Lilly ICOS joint-venture territories for the 2007 period prior to the acquisition of ICOS. Worldwide sales grew 25 percent in 2007. U.S. sales increased 20 percent in 2007, driven by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 28 percent in 2007, driven by increased demand, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher prices. -28- Sales of Evista increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices and lower demand. Sales of Humulin decreased 1 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Alimta increased 28 percent in the U.S., driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 55 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Forteo increased 19 percent in the U.S., driven by higher net selling prices. U.S. sales growth benefited from access to medical coverage through the Medicare Part D program and decreased utilization of our U.S. patient assistance program and, to a lesser extent, increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 21 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Strattera decreased 9 percent in the U.S., as a result of decreased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Our revenues from Actos decreased 46 percent in the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. increased 30 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Worldwide sales of Byetta increased 51 percent to $650.2 million during 2007. Our revenues increased 51 percent to $330.7 million in 2007. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 18 percent, driven by increased demand, the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, and new companion-animal product launches. Sales outside the U.S. increased 10 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2007 gross margin decreased to 77.2 percent of sales compared with 77.4 percent for 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the ICOS acquisition, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and production volumes growing at a slower rate than sales, offset partially by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses (the aggregate of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses) increased 19 percent in 2007. Investment in research and development increased 11 percent, to $3.49 billion. In addition to the acquisition of ICOS, this increase was due to increases in discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 25 percent in 2007, to $6.10 billion. This increase was largely due to the impact of the ICOS acquisition, as well as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta and the diabetes care products, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Acquired IPR&D charges were $745.6 million in 2007 and related to the acquisitions of ICOS, Hypnion, and Ivy, as well as our licensing arrangements with OSI, MacroGenics, and Glenmark. We incurred asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $302.5 million in 2007 as compared to $945.2 million in 2006. See Notes 3, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other — net decreased $115.8 million, to income of $122.0 million. This line item consists of interest expense, interest income, the after-tax operating results of the Lilly ICOS joint venture, and all other miscellaneous income and expense items. • Interest expense for 2007 decreased $9.8 million, to $228.3 million. This decrease is a result of lower average debt balances in 2007 compared to 2006. • Interest income for 2007 decreased $46.6 million, to $215.3 million, due to lower cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006. -29- • The Lilly ICOS joint-venture income was $11.0 million in 2007 as compared to $96.3 million in 2006, due to the acquisition of ICOS on January 29, 2007. • Net other miscellaneous income items increased $6.3 million to $124.0 million. We incurred tax expense of $923.8 million in 2007, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.8 percent, compared with 22.1 percent for 2006. The effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were affected primarily by the nondeductible ICOS and Hypnion IPR&D charges of $594.6 million in 2007, and the product liability charges of $494.9 million in 2006. The tax effect of the product liability charge was less than our effective tax rate, as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $5.93 billion compared with $4.83 billion at December 31, 2007. Cash flow from operations in 2008 of $7.30 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $4.41 billion exceeded the total of the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of $6.08 billion, dividends paid of $2.06 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $947.2 million, and net purchases of noncurrent investments of $815.1 million. Capital expenditures of $947.2 million during 2008 were $135.2 million less than in 2007. We expect 2009 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion as we invest in our biotechnology capabilities, continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems, and invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes care products. Total debt as of December 31, 2008 increased $5.45 billion, to $10.46 billion, reflecting the commercial paper we issued in November 2008 primarily to finance our acquisition of ImClone, offset by long-term debt repayments and paydown of commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s are at AA and A1, respectively. Dividends of $1.88 per share were paid in 2008, an increase of 11 percent from 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, effective for the first-quarter dividend in 2009, the quarterly dividend was increased to $.49 per share (a 4.3 percent increase), resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2009 of $1.96 per share. The year 2008 was the -30- 124th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the 41st consecutive year in which dividends have been increased. In recent months, global economic conditions have deteriorated. Triggered by the liquidity crisis in the capital markets, the implications have become more widespread, resulting in higher unemployment and declines in real consumer spending. In addition, many financial institutions have tightened lines of credit, reducing funding available for near-term economic growth. Pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally been relatively unaffected by economic downturns; however, an extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall prescriptions corresponding with the growth of the uninsured and underinsured population in the U.S. In addition, both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care, including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs. We continue to monitor the potential near-term impact of prescription trends, the credit worthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers, the decline of health insurance coverage in the overall population, and the federal government’s involvement in the economic crisis. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, costs associated with litigation and government investigations, and dividends in 2009. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowings. Our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent illiquidity in the market because of the high credit quality of our short- and long-term debt. In 2009, we intend to fund payments required in connection with the EDPA settlements, and to further reduce outstanding commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations, and the issuance of longterm debt. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Additionally, in November 2008, we obtained a one-year short-term revolving credit facility in the amount of $4.00 billion as back-up, alternative financing. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Financial Expectations for 2009 section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. -31- In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2008 and 2007, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a one-year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, -32- results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 3-5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long-term debt, including interest payments1 $ 8,205.5 $ 595.8 $ 387.0 $ 881.2 $ 6,341.5 Capital lease obligations 41.3 13.1 17.0 5.2 6.0 Operating leases 335.3 90.8 141.4 73.6 29.5 Purchase obligations2 7,923.0 5,976.3 723.5 388.5 834.7 Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 1,088.8 — 316.7 185.0 587.1 Other4 157.1 157.1 — — — Total $ 17,751.0 $ 6,833.1 $ 1,585.6 $ 1,533.5 $ 7,798.8 1 Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2008 to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: • Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2008. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. • Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $906.2 million, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities. 4 This category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2008. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. -33- APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For more than 90 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales, which are outside the U.S., are recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns. We establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Consistent with SFAS 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. Actual product returns have been approximately one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term-care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related -34- to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Sales returns, federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid) and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $1.03 billion, $738.8 million, and $704.8 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. A 5 percent change in the sales return, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2008 would lead to an approximate $52 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2008, our sales returns, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate liability was $618.5 million. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Approximately 80 percent and 78 percent of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. returns, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2008 2007 Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $ 693.5 $ 614.5 Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates1 1,864.9 1,404.0 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (1,751.8 ) (1,325.0 ) Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $ 806.5 $ 693.5 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 0.1 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future. -35- The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Periodically, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 88 percent to 92 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company-specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. We believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2008 annual expense would increase by approximately $27 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2008 service cost and interest cost by approximately $21 million. If the 2008 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $26 million. If the 2008 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by approximately $17 million. If our assumption regarding the 2008 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately $28 million. The U.S. plans represent approximately 83 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 84 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2008. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. The estimated future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the -36- position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. A 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately $43.2 million and $42.3 million, respectively. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2009 For the full year of 2009, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $4.00 to $4.25. We expect volume growth in sales again in 2009, driven by Cymbalta, Alimta, Cialis, Humalog, and the anticipated launches of prasugrel, as well as by the Elanco animal health division. However, the negative impact of weaker foreign currencies, worldwide pricing pressures, and the impact of generic competition in certain markets for Gemzar are anticipated to partially offset these positive impacts. As a result, we expect mid-single digit sales growth. We expect gross margin as a percent of net sales to increase, driven by the strengthening dollar. This increase could be more pronounced in the first half of 2009. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to show flat to low-single digit growth. Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the low-double digits. Other — net is expected to be a net loss of between $200 million and $250 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect continued strong operating cash flow. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in-process research and development charges; foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions; changes in effective tax rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, and government investigations; and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. -37- Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): • Cymbalta: Sixteen generic drug manufacturers have submitted ANDAs seeking permission to market generic versions of Cymbalta prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (the earliest of which expires in 2013). Of these challengers, all allege non-infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial formulation, and eight allege invalidity of the patent claims directed to the active ingredient duloxetine. Of the eight challengers to the compound patent claims, one further alleges invalidity of the claims directed to the use of Cymbalta for treating fibromyalgia, and one alleges the patent having claims directed to the active ingredient is unenforceable. Lawsuits have been filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Activis Elizabeth LLC; Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.; Cobalt Laboratories, Inc.; Impax Laboratories, Inc.; Lupin Limited; Sandoz Inc.; Sun Pharma Global, Inc.; and Wockhardt Limited, seeking rulings that the patents are valid, infringed, and enforceable. Answers to the complaints are pending. • Gemzar: Sicor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sicor), Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (Mayne), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and method-of-use patent expiring in 2013), and alleging that these patents are invalid. We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Sicor (February 2006) and Mayne (October 2006 and January 2008), seeking rulings that these patents are valid and are being infringed. The suit against Sicor has been scheduled for trial in July 2009. Sicor’s ANDAs have been approved by the FDA; however, Sicor must provide 90 days notice prior to marketing generic Gemzar to allow time for us to seek a preliminary injunction. Both suits against Mayne have been administratively closed, and the parties have agreed to be bound by the results of the Sicor suit. In November 2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking rulings that our method-of-use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by the sale of Sun’s generic product. This trial is scheduled for December 2009. • Alimta: Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva) and APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP) each submitted ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant U.S. patent (licensed from the Trustees of Princeton University and expiring in 2016), and alleging the patent is invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Teva and APP, seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed. Trial is scheduled for November 8, 2010. • Evista: Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) submitted an ANDA in 2002 seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2012-2017) and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or not infringed. In November 2002, we filed a lawsuit against Barr in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Barr. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) has also submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista. In June 2006, we filed a similar lawsuit against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The lawsuit against Teva is currently scheduled for trial beginning March 9, 2009, while no trial date has been set in the lawsuit against Barr. In April 2008, the FDA granted Teva tentative approval of its ANDA, but Teva’s ability to market a generic product is subject to a statutory stay, which has been extended to expire on March 9, 2009. If the stay expires and the company cannot obtain preliminary relief from the court, Teva can launch its generic product, regardless of the status of the current litigation, but subject to our right to recover damages, should we prevail at trial. We believe each of these Hatch-Waxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. -38- We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the U.S.: • In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In April 2007, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in February 2008. In June 2007, the Canadian Federal Court held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter of 2007. We sued Novopharm for patent infringement, and the trial began in November 2008. We expect the trial to run through the first quarter of 2009, with a decision in the second half of 2009. In November 2007, Apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of the invalidity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patents, and no trial date has been set. We have brought similar actions against Pharmascience (August 2007), Sandoz (July 2007), Nu-Pharm (June 2008), Genpharm (June 2008) and Cobalt (January 2009); none of these suits has been scheduled for trial. Pharmascience has agreed to be bound by the outcome of the Novopharm suit, and, pending the outcome of the lawsuit, we have agreed not to take any further steps to prevent the company from coming to market with generic olanzapine tablets, subject to a contingent damages obligation should we be successful against Novopharm. • In Germany, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers Egis-Gyogyszergyar and Neolab Ltd. challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In June 2007, the German Federal Patent Court held that our patent is invalid. Generic olanzapine was launched by competitors in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2007. We appealed the decision to the German Federal Supreme Court and following a hearing in December 2008, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Patent Court and found the patent to be valid. Following the decision of the Supreme Court, the generic companies either agreed to withdraw from the market or were subject to preliminary injunction. We are pursuing these companies for damages arising from infringement. • We have received challenges in a number of other countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, and several smaller European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers’ challenges, but further legal challenge is now pending before the Commercial Court in Madrid. In the U.K., the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Limited has challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound and method-of-use patent (expiring in 2011). In October 2008, the Patents Court in the High Court, London ruled that our patent was valid. Dr. Reddy’s appealed this decision, and a hearing date for the appeal has not been set. We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our Zyprexa patents on a country-by-country basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. Xigris and Evista: In June 2002, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts sued us, alleging that sales of two of our products, Xigris and Evista, were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body, and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products. On May 4, 2006, a jury in Boston issued an initial decision in the case that Xigris and Evista sales infringe the patent. The jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $65 million in damages, calculated by applying a 2.3 percent royalty to all U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial. In addition, a separate bench trial with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts was held in August 2006, on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes. In June 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) commenced a reexamination of the patent, and in August 2007 took the position that the Ariad claims at issue are unpatentable, a position that Ariad continues to contest. In September 2007, the Court entered a final judgment indicating that Ariad’s claims are patentable, valid, and enforceable, and finding damages in the amount of $65 million plus a 2.3 percent royalty on net U.S. sales of Xigris and Evista since the time of the jury decision. However, the Court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted. We have appealed this -39- judgment. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal on February 6, 2009. We believe that these allegations are without legal merit, that we will ultimately prevail on these issues, and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote. Government Investigations and Related Litigation In March 2004, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the EDPA advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices, including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors, with respect to Zyprexa, Prozac, and Prozac Weekly. In addition, the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of more than 30 states coordinated with the EDPA in its investigation of any Medicaid-related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of Zyprexa. In January 2009, we announced that we reached resolution of this matter. As part of the resolution, we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and agreed to pay $615.0 million. The misdemeanor plea is for the off-label promotion of Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, between September 1999 and March 2001. We have also entered into a settlement agreement resolving the federal civil claims, under which we will pay approximately $438.0 million, although we do not admit to the allegations. We have also agreed to settle the civil investigations brought by the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of the states that have coordinated with the EDPA in its investigation, and will make available a maximum amount of approximately $362.0 million for payment to those states that agree to settle. The charge we recorded for this matter in the third quarter of $1.42 billion will be sufficient to cover these payments. Also, as part of the settlement, we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This agreement will require us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years. The agreement also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on the company’s systems, processes, policies, procedures and practices. In June 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, of the State of Florida, seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. In September 2006, we received a subpoena from the California Attorney General’s Office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain Zyprexa’s status on California’s formulary, marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa, and remuneration of health care providers. We expect these matters to be resolved if Florida and California participate in the state component of the EDPA resolution. Beginning in August 2006, we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws. Most of these requests became part of a multistate investigative effort coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general. In October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia. While there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted, we paid $62.0 million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years, through consent decrees filed in the settling states. The 32 states participating in the settlement are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Product Liability and Related Litigation We have been named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the U.S. and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the -40- federal lawsuits are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (MDL No. 1596). Since June 2005, we have entered into agreements with various claimants’ attorneys involved in U.S. Zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims. The agreements cover a total of approximately 32,670 claimants, including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims. The two primary settlements were as follows: • In June 2005, we reached an agreement in principle (and in September 2005 a final agreement) to settle more than 8,000 claims for $690.0 million plus $10.0 million to cover administration of the settlement. • In January 2007, we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs’ attorneys to settle more than 18,000 claims for approximately $500 million. The 2005 settlement totaling $700.0 million was paid during 2005. The January 2007 settlements were paid during 2007. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining claims. The U.S. Zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately 105 lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 120 plaintiffs, of which about 80 cases covering about 90 plaintiffs are part of the MDL. No trials have been scheduled related to these claims. In early 2005, we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in Canada on behalf of patients who took Zyprexa. One of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of Quebec, and a second has been certified in Ontario and includes all Canadian residents except for residents of Quebec and British Columbia. The allegations in the Canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the U.S. Since the beginning of 2005, we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of $1.61 billion for Zyprexa product liability matters. The net charges, which take into account our actual insurance recoveries, covered the following: • The cost of the Zyprexa product liability settlements to date; and • Reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the known Zyprexa product liability claims and expected future claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims. In December 2004, we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. These cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the MDL proceedings in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY). In these actions, the Department of Health and Hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for Zyprexa through Medicaid and other drug-benefit programs, as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat Zyprexa-related illnesses. We have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia in the courts of the respective states. The Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia cases are part of the MDL proceedings in the EDNY. The Alaska case was settled in March 2008 for a payment of $15.0 million, plus terms designed to ensure, subject to certain limitations and conditions, that Alaska is treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims. The following cases have been set for trial in 2009: Connecticut in the EDNY in June, Pennsylvania in November, and South Carolina in August, in their respective states. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit, which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. In September -41- 2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers. We appealed the certification order, and Judge Weinstein’s order denying our motion for summary judgment, in September 2008. In 2007, The Pennsylvania Employees Trust Fund brought claims in state court in Pennsylvania as insurer of Pennsylvania state employees, who were prescribed Zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the New York cases. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. The Pennsylvania case is set for trial in October 2009. We cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted. The ultimate resolution of Zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. In addition, we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thimerosal. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past few years, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future.

59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved revenue growth of 6 percent in 2010, which was primarily driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, animal health products, insulin products, Cialis, and Zyprexa, offset by the decline in Gemzar revenue. Cost of sales and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue, while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than revenue and our effective tax rate increased. As a result of these factors, as well as higher other income in 2010 and the items noted below, net income increased 17 percent to $5.07 billion, and earnings per share increased 16 percent to $4.58 per share, in 2010 as compared to $4.33 billion, or $3.94 per share, in 2009. 2010 U.S. Health Care Reform • Due to the enactment of health care reform in the U.S. in March 2010, total revenue decreased by $229.0 million (pretax), or $.16 per share, in 2010 as a result of higher rebates. We also recorded a one-time non-cash deferred income tax charge in the first quarter of $85.1 million, or $.08 per share, associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our U.S. retiree health plan. Acquisitions (Note 3) • We incurred acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges associated with the in-licensing arrangement with Acrux Limited (Acrux) of $50.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.03. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 15) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $192.0 million (pretax), or $.13 per share, in 2010, primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions. 2009 Acquisitions (Note 3) • We incurred acquired IPR&D charges associated with an in-licensing arrangement with Incyte Corporation (Incyte) of $90.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.05. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 15) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $462.7 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.29, for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the sale of our Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site. • We incurred pretax charges of $230.0 million in connection with the claims of several states related to Zyprexa, which decreased earnings per share by $.13. Late-Stage Pipeline Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have more than 65 potential new drugs in human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical development. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. The process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than $1 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that 17 appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Delays and uncertainties in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, one project will not by itself necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline and none are individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that is neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. As a consequence, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by therapeutic category. New molecular entities currently in Phase III clinical trial testing include the following: BAFF antibody—an anti-BAFF antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus BI10773—a SGLT-2 inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim) Enzastaurin—a small molecule for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma GLP-1 Fc—a glucagon-like peptide 1 analog for the treatment of type 2 diabetes Necitumumab—a fully human monoclonal antibody being investigated as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer NERI—a potent and highly selective norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor being investigated as a treatment for major depression Ramucirumab—a monoclonal antibody being investigated as a treatment for metastatic breast and gastric cancers Solanezumab—an amyloid beta (Aß) antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease New molecular entities that have been submitted for regulatory review include the following: Arxxant—a potential treatment for diabetic retinopathy Florbetapir—a molecular imaging tool under investigation for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque in the brain. The absence of beta-amyloid plaque in the brain makes a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease unlikely. Linagliptin—a DPP-4 inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim) Liprotamase—a non-porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy The following are late-stage pipeline developments that have occurred since January 1, 2010: • Axiron. We entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement in the first quarter for the commercialization of Acrux’s experimental testosterone solution Axiron, which the FDA approved in the fourth quarter as a replacement therapy in men for certain conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of testosterone. We, along with our partner Acrux, expect to launch Axiron in the U.S. by mid-2011. • BI10773 and linagliptin. In January 2011, we announced a global agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim to jointly develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes compounds currently in mid- and late-stage development. Included are Boehringer Ingelheim’s two oral diabetes agents, linagliptin and BI10773, as well as our two basal insulin analogues, LY2605541 and LY2963016, along with an option to co-develop and co-commercialize Lilly’s anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody. • Bydureon™—U.S. In October 2010, the FDA issued a complete response letter regarding the New Drug Application (NDA) for Bydureon. In the complete response letter, the FDA requested a safety study to measure the potential for heart rhythm disturbances when exenatide is used at higher-than-average doses. Additionally, the FDA requested the results of the already completed DURATION-5 study to evaluate the efficacy, and the labeling of the safety and effectiveness, of the commercial formulation of Bydureon. We, along with our partners Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) and Alkermes, Inc. (Alkermes), plan to submit our reply to the complete response letter in the second half of 2011. Amylin received written feedback from the FDA indicating approval of the study design for the required safety study to support the regulatory application. The study is expected to begin in February. Based on the requirements for additional data, this will likely be considered a Class 2 resubmission requiring a six-month review. • Bydureon—Europe. We, along with our partners Amylin and Alkermes, submitted Bydureon for review by the European Medicines Agency in the first quarter of 2010. 18 • Cymbalta. The FDA approved Cymbalta for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain in November 2010. This has been established in studies in patients with chronic low back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis. • Florbetapir. In December 2010, we completed the acquisition of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Inc. (Avid), a company developing novel molecular imaging compounds intended for the detection and monitoring of chronic human diseases. In addition, the FDA recently assigned priority review designation for Amyvid™ (florbetapir), Avid’s lead program in development. The Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA held a meeting to discuss Amyvid’s NDA in January 2011. The committee decided that it could not recommend approval of Amyvid at this time based on the currently available data (13-3), but voted unanimously (16-0) to recommend approval of Amyvid conditional on a reader training program that demonstrates reader accuracy and consistency through a re-read of previously acquired scans. The committee supported that efficacy was established and there were no significant safety concerns. • Liprotamase. In July 2010, we completed our acquisition of Alnara Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alnara), a privately-held company developing protein therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic diseases. In January 2011, the FDA Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee voted to recommend non-approval of liprotamase, Alnara’s non-porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). During the meeting, the committee had questions about the degree of efficacy of liprotamase and recommended that additional studies be conducted prior to considering approval of liprotamase for EPI. We will continue to work with the FDA to address the questions raised in the meeting as the agency moves toward a final decision on the application. • Livalo. We, along with our partner, Kowa Pharmaceuticals America Inc., launched Livalo in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2010. In addition to a proper diet, Livalo is used for the treatment of high cholesterol (primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia) in adults. • Necitumumab. In February 2011, we and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company stopped enrollment in one of the two global Phase III studies evaluating necitumumab, an investigational anti-cancer agent, as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The decision to stop enrollment in the Phase III non-squamous NSCLC INSPIRE trial followed an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommendation that no new or recently enrolled patients continue treatment in the trial because of safety concerns related to thromboembolism (blood clots) in the experimental arm of the study. The same DMC also noted that patients who have already received two or more cycles of necitumumab appear to have a lower ongoing risk for these safety concerns. These patients may choose to remain on the trial, after being informed of the additional potential risks. Investigators will continue to assess patients after two cycles to determine if there is a potential benefit from treatment. • Semagacestat. In August 2010, we halted development of semagacestat, a gamma secretase inhibitor being studied as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, because preliminary results from two ongoing long-term Phase III studies showed the compound did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. • Tasisulam. In December 2010, we suspended all current Phase III studies evaluating tasisulam as a second-line treatment for those with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Tasisulam, an investigational, small-molecule anti-cancer compound, continues to be studied in other types of cancers. • Teplizumab. In October 2010, we and our partner, MacroGenics, Inc., announced that an independent DMC completed a planned analysis of one-year safety and efficacy data of the Protégé Phase III clinical trial of teplizumab, an investigational biologic under development for the treatment of individuals with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. The DMC concluded that the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was not met. The DMC, noting that all administration of experimental drug had been completed, commented that appropriate safety monitoring is warranted. No unanticipated safety issues were identified in the DMC’s review. The companies have decided to suspend further enrollment and dosing of patients in two other ongoing clinical trials of teplizumab in type 1 diabetes. In October 2010, we notified MacroGenics of our decision to terminate our collaboration agreement for the development of teplizumab. Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters The U.S. compound patent for Gemzar expired November 15, 2010. Our method-of-use patent (expiring in 2013) was held invalid by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We are seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court, but generic gemcitabine was introduced to the U.S. market in mid-November 2010, and Gemzar sales are experiencing a rapid and severe decline. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled that our method-of-use patent for Strattera, which expires in 2017, is invalid. Our appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was heard in December 2010, and we are awaiting a ruling. The Court of Appeals has granted an injunction that prevents the launch of generic atomoxetine until a ruling is rendered. Several generic companies have tentative approval to market generic atomoxetine, and, should the appeal be unsuccessful, we would anticipate a rapid and severe decline in Strattera sales due to generic competition. The enactment of the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” and “The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010” in March 2010 brings significant changes to U.S. health care. These changes began to 19 affect our financial results in the first quarter of 2010 and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future. Changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to Medicaid beneficiaries, which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent, were generally effective in the first quarter of 2010. This rebate has been expanded to managed Medicaid, a program that provides for the delivery of Medicaid benefits via managed care organizations, under arrangements between those organizations and state Medicaid agencies. Additionally, a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in certain types of health care facilities that serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B facilities) has been expanded. Also, there are changes to the tax treatment of subsidies paid by the government to employers, such as us, who provide their retirees with a drug benefit at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013, the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. While this tax will not take effect for three more years, accounting rules dictate that we adjust our deferred tax asset through a one-time non-cash charge upon enactment of the tax law change, which we recorded in the first quarter of 2010. In addition, the federal government created an expedited regulatory approval pathway in the U.S. for biosimilars or follow-on biologics (copies of biological compounds). Biologics will have at least 12 years of data-package protection following launch. Congress is expected to take up patent law reform in 2011; some proposals would strengthen the pharmaceutical business model while others under consideration might pose some risks. Beginning in 2011, drug manufacturers will provide a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the “doughnut hole” (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage). The doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between 2011 and 2020. Additionally, beginning in 2011, a non-tax deductible annual fee will be imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. This fee is allocated to companies based on their prior calendar year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs. A guidance project is currently under way within the IRS and U.S. Treasury concerning the implementation of this fee. These costs will be included in marketing, selling, and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The Obama Administration proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S.-based companies. Some provisions changing taxation of international income were enacted in August 2010. These provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, continues to be a topic of discussion for Congress and the Obama Administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. On October 25, 2010, Puerto Rico enacted income and excise tax legislation affecting our operations. This tax will be included in costs of sales in our consolidated statement of operations. We believe this tax should be creditable against our U.S. income taxes. Certain other federal and state health care proposals may continue to be debated, and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices. These proposals include legalizing the importation of prescription drugs and other cost-control strategies. In addition, the constitutionality of U.S. health care reform is being challenged. We expect pricing pressures at state levels to become more severe, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and several European countries have recently required either price decreases or rebate increases in response to economic pressures. There are proposals for cost-containment measures pending in a number of additional countries, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls, limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. Such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact, given the effect of the downturn in the global economy on local governments. 20 OPERATING RESULTS—2010 Revenue Our worldwide revenue for 2010 increased 6 percent, to $23.08 billion, driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, animal health products, insulin products, Cialis, and Zyprexa, offset by the decline in Gemzar revenue. Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent, while selling prices contributed 2 percent of revenue growth, and the impact of foreign exchange rates was negligible. Revenue in the U.S. increased 5 percent, to $12.87 billion, due to higher prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, to $10.21 billion, due to increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. In 2010, total revenue was reduced by $229.0 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform. The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2010 compared with 2009: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Year EndedDecember 31, 2009 Total PercentChange from 2009 Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total2 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,495.5 $ 2,530.9 $ 5,026.4 $ 4,915.7 2 Cymbalta 2,772.0 687.2 3,459.2 3,074.7 13 Alimta 957.1 1,251.5 2,208.6 1,706.0 29 Humalog 1,222.4 831.8 2,054.2 1,959.0 5 Cialis 658.1 1,041.4 1,699.4 1,559.1 9 Animal health products 775.1 616.3 1,391.4 1,207.2 15 Gemzar 723.3 426.1 1,149.4 1,363.2 (16 ) Humulin 470.8 618.0 1,088.9 1,022.0 7 Evista 681.8 342.6 1,024.4 1,030.4 (1 ) Forteo 499.0 331.0 830.1 816.7 2 Strattera 389.8 186.9 576.7 609.4 (5 ) Other pharmaceutical products 737.4 1,196.3 1,933.5 1,908.1 1 Total net product sales 12,382.3 10,060.0 22,442.2 21,171.5 6 Collaboration and other revenue3 483.3 150.4 633.8 664.5 (5 ) Total revenue $ 12,865.6 $ 10,210.4 $ 23,076.0 $ 21,836.0 6 1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico. 2 Numbers may not add due to rounding. 3 Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of Erbitux royalties and 50 percent of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S. Zyprexa, our top-selling product, is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 7 percent in 2010, driven by higher prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent driven by lower prices and decreased demand in Europe and Canada, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in Japan. We will lose effective exclusivity for Zyprexa in the U.S. in October 2011. We will also lose effective exclusivity in most of Europe in 2011. In the five major European countries, which in the aggregate had approximately $1.40 billion in sales for 2010, we will lose effective exclusivity in April 2011 (Spain) and September 2011 (France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom). Several manufacturers have received tentative approvals to market generic olanzapine, and we expect generic olanzapine to be introduced in these markets immediately following the expiration of the patents. While it is difficult to predict the precise impact on Zyprexa sales, we expect the introduction of generics to result in a rapid and severe decline in our Zyprexa sales, which will have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows. In Japan, our second-largest market for Zyprexa, with more than $400 million of sales in 2010, our patent expires in December 2015. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and in the United States for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia, increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 31 percent, driven primarily by increased demand in Japan, Europe, and Canada. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 17 percent in the U.S., due primarily to increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 41 percent, due to increased demand. Demand outside the U.S. was favorably affected by continued strong growth in Japan. Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 1 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices, partially offset by the impact of wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven by increased demand primarily in Japan and China. Sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction, increased 6 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, due primarily to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. 21 Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to treat various cancers, decreased 3 percent in the U.S., due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition, which began in November 2010, following the expiration of the compound patent. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 31 percent, due primarily to generic competition in most major markets. We expect sales to decline in 2011, with severe declines in the U.S. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 17 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. remained essentially flat when compared to 2009, due to lower prices offset by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, remained essentially flat in the U.S., due to decreased demand offset by increased prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by lower prices and lower demand, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men, decreased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and in the U.S. in adults, decreased 13 percent in the U.S., due primarily to lower demand, and to a lesser extent, lower net effective selling prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 14 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled that the U.S. method-of-use patent for Strattera, which expires in 2017, is invalid. We are currently appealing this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals has granted an injunction that prevents the launch of generic atomoxetine until a ruling is rendered. While it is difficult to predict the precise impact on Strattera sales, if our appeal is unsuccessful, we expect that the introduction of generics would result in a rapid and severe decline in our U.S. Strattera sales. Worldwide sales of Byetta, an injectable product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, decreased 11 percent to $710.2 million during 2010 due to competitive pressures in the U.S. and European markets. We report as revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S., 100 percent of Byetta sales outside the U.S., and our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin. Our revenues decreased 4 percent to $430.6 million in 2010. We report as revenue for Erbitux, a product approved to treat various cancers, the net royalties received from our collaboration partners and our product sales. Our revenues were $386.1 million in 2010, compared with $390.8 million in 2009. Animal health product sales in the U.S. and outside the U.S. increased 15 percent, due primarily to increased demand for our companion animal and feed additive products. Sales of Comfortis, a flea medication for dogs, increased 69 percent in 2010. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 0.5 percentage points in 2010 to 81.1 percent. This increase was due to lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2010 to $7.05 billion. The increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S., partially offset by lower administrative and litigation expenses and company-wide cost containment efforts. Investment in research and development increased 13 percent, to $4.88 billion, due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules, including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials. We incurred an IPR&D charge of $50.0 million in 2010, associated with the in-licensing agreement with Acrux, compared with $90.0 million in 2009 resulting from the in-licensing agreement with Incyte. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $192.0 million in 2010, primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. In 2009, we recognized charges totaling $692.7 million for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges. See Notes 3, 5 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other—net, expense improved $224.5 million to a net expense of $5.0 million in 2010, due primarily to net gains on equity investments, lower net interest expense, damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, and an insurance recovery associated with the theft of product at the company’s Enfield, Connecticut, distribution center. The effective tax rate was 22.3 percent for the full-year 2010. In 2009, the effective tax rate was 19.2 percent. The 2010 effective tax rate increased due to $85.1 million in additional tax expense in the first quarter related to U.S. health care reform. The 2009 effective tax rate was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site. 22 OPERATING RESULTS—2009 Financial Results We achieved revenue growth of 7 percent in 2009, which was primarily driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, and Zyprexa and the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a result of the ImClone Systems Inc. (ImClone) acquisition in November 2008. The impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during the year decreased our cost of sales in 2009 and increased our cost of sales in 2008, which contributed to an improvement in gross margin. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue, while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than sales. We incurred income tax expense of $1.03 billion in 2009, resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.2 percent. Earnings increased to $4.33 billion, and earnings per share increased to $3.94 per share, in 2009 as compared to a net loss of $2.07 billion, and a loss per share of $1.89 in 2008. Net income comparisons between 2009 and 2008 are affected by the impact of several highlighted items. The highlighted items for 2009 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2008 highlighted items are summarized as follows: Acquisitions (Note 3) • We recognized charges totaling $4.73 billion (pretax) associated with the acquisition of ImClone, which decreased earnings per share by $4.46. These amounts include an IPR&D charge of $4.69 billion (pretax). The remaining net expenses are related to ImClone’s operating results subsequent to the acquisition, incremental interest costs, and amortization of the intangible asset associated with Erbitux. We also incurred IPR&D charges of $28.0 million (pretax) associated with the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SGX), which decreased earnings per share by $.03. • We incurred IPR&D charges associated with licensing arrangements with BioMS Medical Corp. (BioMS) and TransPharma Medical Ltd. totaling $122.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.07. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 15) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges totaling $497.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.30. A similar charge of $57.1 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.04, was included in cost of sales. These charges were primarily associated with the sale of our Greenfield, Indiana site; the termination of the AIR® Insulin program; and strategic exit activities related to manufacturing operations. • We recorded charges of $1.48 billion (pretax) related to the federal and state Zyprexa investigations led by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA), as well as the resolution of a multi-state investigation regarding Zyprexa involving 32 states and the District of Columbia, which decreased earnings per share by $1.20. Other (Note 13) • We recognized a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million as a result of the resolution of a substantial portion of the IRS audit of our federal income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, which increased earnings per share by $.19. Revenue Our worldwide revenue for 2009 increased 7 percent, to $21.84 billion, driven primarily by growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, and Zyprexa, and the inclusion of Erbitux revenue as a result of the ImClone acquisition. Worldwide sales volume increased 7 percent, while selling prices contributed 3 percent of revenue growth, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 3 percent. Revenue in the U.S. increased 12 percent, to $12.29 billion, due to higher prices and higher demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 1 percent, to $9.54 billion, due to increased demand, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices. 23 The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2009 compared with 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2009 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Total PercentChangefrom 2008 Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total2 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,331.7 $ 2,583.9 $ 4,915.7 $ 4,696.1 5 Cymbalta 2,551.8 523.0 3,074.7 2,697.1 14 Humalog 1,208.4 750.6 1,959.0 1,735.8 13 Alimta 815.6 890.4 1,706.0 1,154.7 48 Cialis 623.3 935.8 1,559.1 1,444.5 8 Gemzar 747.4 615.8 1,363.2 1,719.8 (21 ) Animal health products 672.2 535.0 1,207.2 1,093.3 10 Evista 682.2 348.1 1,030.4 1,075.6 (4 ) Humulin 402.4 619.6 1,022.0 1,063.2 (4 ) Forteo 518.3 298.4 816.7 778.7 5 Strattera 445.6 163.7 609.4 579.5 5 Other pharmaceutical products 739.9 1,168.4 1,908.1 1,887.5 1 Total net product sales 11,738.8 9,432.7 21,171.5 19,925.8 6 Collaboration and other revenue3 555.6 108.9 664.5 446.1 49 Total revenue $ 12,294.4 $ 9,541.6 $ 21,836.0 $ 20,371.9 7 1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico. 2 Numbers may not add due to rounding. 3 Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of Erbitux royalties and 50 percent of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 6 percent in 2009, due to higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 4 percent driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the U.S. was favorably impacted by the withdrawal of generic competition in Germany in early 2009. Sales of Cymbalta in 2009 increased 13 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 18 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower prices. Sales of Humalog in 2009 increased 20 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, increased demand, and wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Alimta increased 45 percent in the U.S., primarily driven by increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Demand outside the U.S. benefited from the addition of the non-small cell lung cancer indication in Japan. Our sales of Cialis increased 16 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, increased demand, and wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Gemzar increased 2 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 37 percent, driven by reduced demand and lower prices as a result of the entry of generic competition in most major markets, and to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista decreased 3 percent in the U.S., driven by reduced demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 7 percent, driven by the outlicensing of Evista in most European markets and, to a lesser extent, lower prices. Sales of Humulin increased 6 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 9 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower prices, partially offset by increased demand. Sales of Forteo increased 6 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 3 percent, driven by increased demand and prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Strattera increased 2 percent in the U.S., driven by higher prices, partially offset by reduced demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 15 percent, driven by increased demand and higher prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 24 Worldwide sales of Byetta increased 6 percent to $796.5 million during 2009. Our revenues increased 13 percent to $448.5 million in 2009. Erbitux revenues were $390.8 million in 2009, compared with $29.4 million in 2008. We acquired Erbitux as part of our acquisition of ImClone in November 2008. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 25 percent, primarily driven by the inclusion of Posilac sales following the acquisition completed October 2008. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 4 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses The 2009 gross margin increased to 80.6 percent of total revenue compared with 78.5 percent for 2008. This increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold during the year, which decreased cost of sales in 2009, but increased cost of sales in 2008. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 4 percent in 2009 to $6.89 billion. The increase was driven by the increased marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S., higher incentive compensation, and the impact of the ImClone acquisition, partially offset by the movement of foreign exchange rates. Investment in research and development increased 13 percent, to $4.33 billion, due primarily to the ImClone acquisition and increased late-stage clinical trial costs. We incurred an IPR&D charge of $90.0 million in 2009, associated with the in-licensing agreement with Incyte, compared with $4.84 billion in 2008. The 2008 IPR&D charge included $4.69 billion resulting from the acquisition of ImClone. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $692.7 million in 2009, primarily related to asset impairment charges related to the sale of our Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site and special charges related to Zyprexa litigation with multiple state attorneys general, compared with $1.97 billion in 2008. The 2008 charges were primarily associated with the resolution of Zyprexa investigations with the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and multiple states. See Notes 3, 5, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other—net, expense was a net expense in both years, increasing by $203.4 million, to $229.5 million in 2009, primarily due to lower interest income and higher interest expense resulting from the ImClone acquisition. We incurred income tax expense of $1.03 billion in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.2 percent. The effective tax rate for 2009 was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the Tippecanoe site. We incurred tax expense of $764.3 million in 2008, despite having a loss before income taxes of $1.31 billion. Our net loss was driven by the $4.69 billion IPR&D charge for ImClone and the $1.48 billion Zyprexa investigation settlements. The IPR&D charge was not tax deductible, and only a portion of the Zyprexa investigation settlements was deductible. In addition, we recorded tax expense associated with the ImClone acquisition, as well as a discrete income tax benefit of $210.3 million for the resolution of a substantial portion of the 2001-2004 IRS audit. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2010, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $6.73 billion compared with $4.50 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in cash was driven by cash from operations of $6.86 billion, partially offset by dividends paid of $2.17 billion, business and product acquisitions of $1.10 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $694.3 million. Capital expenditures of $694.3 million during 2010 were $70.7 million less than in 2009. We expect 2011 capital expenditures to be between $800 million and $900 million as we invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes care products, continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems, and invest in our oncology biotechnology capabilities. Total debt at December 31, 2010, was $6.93 billion, an increase of $264.4 million from December 31, 2009, which was due to the $141.8 million increase in the fair value of hedged debt and an increase in short-term debt of $130.7 million. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s are AA- and A2, respectively. Our Moody’s long-term debt rating was moved to A2 from A1 in November 2010. Our ratings outlook from both Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s is stable. Dividends of $1.96 per share were paid in 2010 and 2009, 2010 was the 126th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments. In the fourth quarter of 2010, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2011, the quarterly dividend was maintained at $.49 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2011 of $1.96 per share. As of the fourth quarter of 2010, the U.S. and global economic recoveries proceed but face continued headwinds. U.S. economic data in the fourth quarter reflected a steady pace of economic recovery, though the rate of recovery has not been sufficient to materially reduce unemployment. Given persistently high unemployment and little sign of near-term inflation risk, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained its accommodative monetary policy, most recently through its November 2010 announcement of expanded asset purchases. The Federal Reserve continues its policy stance of exceptionally low rates for an extended period to stimulate lending and economic growth. High sovereign debt levels and efforts at fiscal austerity in the U.S. and other developed countries continue to be a concern for many economists and are predicted to challenge the economic recovery globally. Given this backdrop, both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges and are taking steps to reduce the costs of care, 25 including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates in the U.S., price cuts in government systems outside the U.S., and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs globally. We continue to monitor the potential near-term impact of the economic environment on prescription trends, the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers, the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation, the federal government’s involvement in the U.S. economy, and various international government funding levels. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, and dividends in 2011. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowings. Because of the high credit quality of our short- and long-term debt, our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program and matures in May 2011. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and the “Financial Expectations for 2011” section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. Through 2014, we expect to lose effective exclusivity for the following key products: • Zyprexa—October 2011 (U.S.), various dates in 2011 (major Europe) • Cymbalta—June 2013 (U.S.) • Humalog—May 2013 (U.S.) • Evista—March 2014 (U.S.) Cymbalta could receive an additional six months of exclusivity, based on completion of pediatric studies. Gemzar has already lost effective exclusivity in the U.S. and major European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), and Humalog has lost exclusivity in major European countries. In addition, we face U.S. patent litigation over Alimta, Cymbalta, and Strattera, and it is possible we could lose our effective exclusivity for one or more of these products prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. See the Hatch-Waxman patent litigation discussion in Note 15 and in the “Legal and Regulatory Matters” section below. Revenue from Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, and Zyprexa contribute materially to our results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. The loss of exclusivity would likely result in generic competition, generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, our goal is to partially mitigate the effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial position through growth in our patent-protected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period, in emerging markets, in Japan, and in our animal health business. Our expected growth in the emerging markets and Japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of patent-protected products in these markets. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2010 and 2009, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures. Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone 26 and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt, including interest payments1 $ 9,965.2 $ 205.8 $ 1,936.7 $ 1,429.1 $ 6,393.6 Capital lease obligations 38.9 13.9 13.1 8.5 3.4 Operating leases 572.3 108.7 162.6 103.2 197.8 Purchase obligations2 11,806.2 9,206.6 1,105.7 740.5 753.4 Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 1,252.9 0.0 309.2 238.8 704.9 Other4 298.3 298.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total $ 23,933.8 $ 9,833.3 $ 3,527.3 $ 2,520.1 $ 8,053.1 1 Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2010, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: • Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2010. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. • Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.23 billion, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities. 4 This category consists of various miscellaneous items expected to be paid in the next year, none of which are individually material. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2010. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. For approximately 85 percent of our sales, this is at the time products are shipped to the customer, typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain. The remaining sales, which are outside the U.S., are recorded at the point of delivery. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. 27 We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns. We establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance, when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. Actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. U.S. sales returns, federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid), and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $1.66 billion, $1.20 billion, and $1.03 billion in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. A 5 percent change in the sales return, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2010 would lead to an approximate $85 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2010, our sales returns, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate liability was $858.3 million. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Approximately 83 percent and 84 percent of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. returns, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2010 2009 Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $ 963.6 $ 806.5 Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates1 2,876.1 2,233.8 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (2,684.4 ) (2,076.7 ) Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $ 1,155.3 $ 963.6 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. 28 Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. In the past several years, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 80 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company-specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2010 annual expense would increase by $14.4 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would lower the aggregate of the 2010 service cost and interest cost by $11.7 million. If the 2010 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $28.7 million. If the 2010 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $18.3 million. If our assumption regarding the 2010 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $33.3 million. The U.S. plans represent approximately 81 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 83 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2010. Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. There are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization, to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each project independently. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in the “Late-Stage Pipeline” section. 29 The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some IPR&D assets will become impaired at some time in the future. The estimated future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. A 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $53.5 million and $23.7 million, respectively. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2011 For the full year of 2011, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.92 to $4.07, which includes the dilutive impact of the upfront fee and other anticipated expenses related to the collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, but excludes potential restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. We expect that total revenue growth will be flat to slightly increasing, which assumes we maintain our patent exclusivity for U.S. Strattera sales, and also assumes rapid and severe erosion of global Zyprexa sales after patent expirations in major markets, including the U.S. starting in October 2011, and the continued severe erosion of U.S. Gemzar sales. We anticipate that the impact of U.S. health care reform will lower 2011 revenue by $400 million to $500 million. We expect these reductions in revenue to be offset by sales growth of Alimta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Effient, Humalog, and animal health products. We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will decline approximately two percentage points. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits and include an estimated $150 million to $200 million in non-tax deductible expense for the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers fee associated with U.S. health care reform, while research and development expense growth is expected to be relatively flat. Other—net, expense is expected to be a net expense of between $50 million and $150 million. Cash flows are expected to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of between $800 and $900 million, as well as anticipated business development activity and our dividend. PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995— A CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by us, including those above, are based on management’s belief at the time they are made. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the implementation of U.S. health care reform; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired IPR&D charges; foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions; changes in effective tax rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, patent disputes, and government investigations; the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals; and other factors that may affect our operations and prospects are discussed earlier in this section and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements. 30 LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters, we believe that, except as specifically noted below, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following U.S. patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): • Cymbalta: Sixteen generic drug manufacturers have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking permission to market generic versions of Cymbalta prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (the earliest of which expires in 2013). Of these challengers, all allege non-infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial formulation, and nine allege invalidity (and some also allege nonenforceability) of the patent claims directed to the active ingredient duloxetine. Of the nine challengers to the compound patent claims, one further alleges invalidity of the claims directed to the use of Cymbalta for treating fibromyalgia. In November 2008 we filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Actavis Elizabeth LLC; Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.; Cobalt Laboratories, Inc.; Impax Laboratories, Inc.; Lupin Limited; Sandoz Inc.; and Wockhardt Limited, seeking rulings that the compound patent claims are valid, infringed, and enforceable. We filed similar lawsuits in the same court against Sun Pharma Global, Inc. in December 2008 and against Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in August 2009. The cases have been consolidated and actions against all but Wockhardt Limited have been stayed pursuant to stipulations by the defendants to be bound by the outcome of the litigation through appeal. The Wockhardt Limited trial is scheduled to begin in June 2011. • Gemzar: Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (Sun) and several other generic companies sought permission to market generic versions of Gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (compound patent expiring in 2010 and method-of-use patent expiring in 2013). We filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Teva (February 2006) and several other generic companies, seeking rulings that our patents are valid and are being infringed. In November 2007, Sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking rulings that our method-of-use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by the sale of Sun’s generic product. In August 2009, the district court in Michigan granted a motion by Sun for partial summary judgment, invalidating our method-of-use patent, and the opinion was affirmed by a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in July 2010. We are seeking review of this decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. In March 2010, the district court in Indiana upheld the validity of our compound patent in the Teva case, but applied collateral estoppel with regard to our method-of-use patent, given the ruling in the Sun case. Generic gemcitabine was introduced to the U.S. market in mid-November 2010. • Alimta: Teva; APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP); and Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) each submitted ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant U.S. patent (licensed from the Trustees of Princeton University and expiring in 2016), and alleging the patent is invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Teva, APP, and Barr seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed. In November 2010, the district court ruled from the bench that judgment would be entered in Lilly’s favor, upholding the patent’s validity. Plaintiffs may appeal this decision once the judgment is entered. • Evista: In 2006, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva USA) submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market a generic version of Evista prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patents (expiring in 2012-2017) and alleging that these patents are invalid, not enforceable, or not infringed. In June 2006, we filed a lawsuit against Teva USA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking a ruling that these patents are valid, enforceable, and being infringed by Teva USA. In September 2009, the court upheld our method-of-use patents (the last expires in 2014) and the court held that our particle-size patents (expiring 2017) are invalid. Both rulings were upheld by the appeals court in September 2010, and the period for further appeals has expired. • Strattera: Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis), Apotex Inc. (Apotex), Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun Ltd.), and Teva USA each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patent (expiring in 2017), and alleging that this patent is invalid. In 2007, we brought a lawsuit against Actavis, Apotex, Aurobindo, Mylan, Sandoz, Sun Ltd., and Teva USA in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In August 2010, the court ruled that our patent is invalid. Several companies have received final approval to market generic atomoxetine, but the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted an injunction prohibiting the launch of generic atomoxetine until the court renders an opinion. The appeal was heard by the court in December 2010 and we are waiting for a ruling. Zydus Pharmaceuticals (Zydus) filed an action in the New Jersey district court in October 2010 seeking a declaratory judgment that it has the right to launch a generic atomoxetine product, based on the district court ruling. We believe that Zydus is subject to the injunction issued by the court of appeals. 31 We believe each of these Hatch-Waxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We have received challenges to Zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the U.S.: • In Canada, several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011). In April 2007, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against the first challenger, Apotex Inc. (Apotex), and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in February 2008. In June 2007, the Canadian Federal Court held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger, Novopharm Ltd. (Novopharm), was justified and denied our request that Novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in Canada. Novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in Canada in the third quarter of 2007. In September 2009, the Canadian Federal Court ruled against us in the Novapharm suit, finding our patent invalid. However, in July 2010 the appeals court set aside the decision and remitted the limited issues of utility and sufficiency of disclosure to the trial court. • In Germany, the German Federal Supreme Court upheld the validity of our Zyprexa patent (expiring in 2011) in December 2008, reversing an earlier decision of the Federal Patent Court. Following the decision of the Supreme Court, the generic companies who launched generic olanzapine based on the earlier decision either agreed to withdraw from the market or were subject to injunction. We have negotiated settlements of the damages arising from infringement with most of the generic companies. • We have received challenges in a number of other countries, including Spain, Austria, Australia, Portugal, and several smaller European countries. In Spain, we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers’ challenges, but additional actions against multiple generic companies are now pending. In March 2010, the District Court of Hague ruled against us and revoked our compound patent in the Netherlands. We have appealed this decision. We have also successfully defended Zyprexa patents in Austria and Portugal. We are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our Zyprexa patents on a country-by-country basis. We cannot determine the outcome of this litigation. The availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. Zyprexa Litigation We were named as a defendant in a large number of Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the U.S. and notified of other claims of individuals who have not filed suit. The lawsuits and unfiled claims (together the “claims”) allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) (MDL No. 1596). Since June 2005, we have settled approximately 32,720 claims. The two primary settlements were as follows: • In 2005, we settled and paid more than 8,000 claims for approximately $700 million. • In 2007, we settled and paid more than 18,000 claims for approximately $500 million. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all remaining claims, consisting of approximately 70 lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 150 plaintiffs, of which about 50 lawsuits covering about 50 plaintiffs are part of the MDL. We have a trial scheduled in Texas State court in August 2011. In January 2009, we reached resolution with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA), and the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units of 36 states and the District of Columbia, of an investigation related to our U.S. marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa. As part of the resolution, we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the off-label promotion of Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, between September 1999 and March 2001. We recorded a charge of $1.42 billion for this matter in the third quarter of 2008 and paid substantially all of this amount in 2009. As part of the settlement, we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which requires us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years. The agreement also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on the company’s systems, processes, policies, procedures, and practices. In October 2008, we reached a settlement with 32 states and the District of Columbia related to a multistate investigation brought under various state consumer protection laws. While there was no finding that we violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted, we paid $62.0 million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding Zyprexa for a period of six years, through consent decrees filed with the settling states. We were served with lawsuits filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia alleging that Zyprexa 32 caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. We settled the Zyprexa-related claims of all of these states, incurring pretax charges of $230.0 million in 2009 and $15.0 million in 2008. In 2005, two lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions were consolidated into a single lawsuit, brought under certain state consumer protection statutes, the federal civil RICO statute, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. Two additional lawsuits were filed in the EDNY in 2006 on similar grounds. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. In September 2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers and denied our motion for summary judgment. In September 2010, both decisions were reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the case cannot proceed as a class action and entered a judgment in our favor on plaintiffs’ overpricing claim. Plaintiffs are seeking review of this decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. An unfavorable outcome in this case could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. Other Product Liability Litigation We have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol (DES), thimerosal, and Byetta. Approximately a third of these claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Product Liability Insurance Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past several years, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk You can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) in Item 7 at “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference. 33",2023-12-30 16:23:10.647884
59478,LLY,ELI LILLY & Co,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This section provides an overview of our financial results, recent product and late-stage pipeline developments, and legal, regulatory, and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry. Financial Results We achieved revenue growth of 5 percent in 2011, which was primarily driven by the collective growth of Cymbalta, insulin products, animal health products, Alimta, Effient, and Cialis, offset by the decline in Gemzar and Zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity. This revenue growth, as well as a lower effective tax rate, was more than offset by lower gross margin percentage; increased marketing, selling, and administrative costs; higher other expense; and the increased impact in 2011 of the items noted below. As a result, net income decreased 14 percent to $4.35 billion, and earnings per share decreased 15 percent to $3.90 per share, in 2011 as compared to $5.07 billion, or $4.58 per share, in 2010. 2011 U.S. Health Care Reform • As a result of higher rebates and subsidies included in health care reform enacted in the U.S. during 2010, total revenue in 2011 was reduced by $408.8 million (pretax), or $.29 per share. Also, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased by $178.0 million (pretax), or $.16 per share, as a result of the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers’ fee. Collaborations (Note 4) • We incurred acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges associated with the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim of $388.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.23. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Note 5) • We recognized restructuring charges of $316.4 million (pretax), or $.24 per share, primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. • We incurred a charge of $85.0 million (pretax), or approximately $.05 per share, in 2011 primarily for returned product and contractual commitments related to the withdrawal of Xigris. 2010 U.S. Health Care Reform • As a result of higher rebates included in health care reform enacted in the U.S. during 2010, total revenue in 2010 was reduced by $229.0 million (pretax), or $.16 per share. We also recorded a one-time non-cash deferred income tax charge in the first quarter of $85.1 million, or $.08 per share, associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our U.S. retiree health plan. Acquisitions (Note 3) • We incurred acquired IPR&D charges associated with the in-licensing arrangement with Acrux Limited (Acrux) of $50.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.03. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Note 5) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $192.0 million (pretax), or $.13 per share, primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions. Late-Stage Pipeline Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We currently have approximately 65 potential new drugs in human testing and a larger number of projects in preclinical research. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) and the introduction of new products. A high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development. The process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take 12 to 15 years or longer and cost more than 17 $1 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. As a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Delays and uncertainties in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved and the sales growth of those products. We manage R&D spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total R&D spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the R&D process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our R&D projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful R&D project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated R&D expense. While we do accumulate certain R&D costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total R&D costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category. The following new molecular entities (NMEs) are currently in Phase III clinical trial testing for potential use in the diseases described. The quarter in which the NME initially entered Phase III for any indication is shown in parentheses: Dulaglutide* (Q3 2008)—a glucagon-like peptide 1 analog for the treatment of type 2 diabetes Edivoxetine (Q4 2010)—a norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of major depression Empagliflozin-BI10773 (Q3 2010)—a sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT-2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim) Enzastaurin (Q1 2006)—a small molecule for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Ixekizumab—formerly IL-17 MAb* (Q4 2011)—a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of psoriasis Necitumumab* (Q4 2009)—a fully human monoclonal antibody for the treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb) New insulin glargine product—formerly LY2963016 (Q3 2011)—a new insulin glargine product for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim) Novel basal insulin analog* (Q4 2011)—a novel basal insulin for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim) Pomaglumetad Methionil (Q1 2011)—a metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu 2/3) receptor agonist for the treatment of schizophrenia Ramucirumab* (Q4 2009)—a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of metastatic breast, gastric, liver, NSCLC, and colorectal cancers Solanezumab* (Q2 2009)—an amyloid beta (Aß) antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Tabalumab—formerly BAFF MAb* (Q4 2010)—an anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody for the treatment of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis * Biologic molecule subject to the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act The following NMEs have been submitted for regulatory review for potential use in the disease described. The quarter the NME initially was submitted for any indication is shown in parentheses: Florbetapir (Q3 2010)—a molecular imaging tool for the detection of beta-amyloid plaque in the brain Liprotamase (Q1 2010)—a non-porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The following late-stage pipeline developments have occurred since January 1, 2011: Arxxant—In December, we completed and evaluated the final clinical trial for Arxxant, the EYES study, which did not meet the primary study endpoint. We have opted not to re-submit Arxxant to the FDA for diabetic retinopathy. Bydureon—In June, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Bydureon, the first once-weekly treatment for type 2 diabetes in combination with certain oral therapies. European launches began in the third quarter of 2011, starting with the United Kingdom and Germany. In January 2012, the FDA approved Bydureon as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. We and Amylin terminated the collaboration in November 2011; refer to Note 4 of the Financial Statements for additional information. Florbetapir—In March, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for the New Drug Application (NDA) for Amyvid (florbetapir) that was primarily focused on the need to establish a reader training program for market implementation that helps to ensure reader accuracy and consistency of interpretations of existing Amyvid scans. We submitted our response to the FDA’s complete response letter. Ixekizumab—In November, we began the first Phase III clinical trial for ixekizumab. 18 Linagliptin and Empagliflozin—In January 2011, we announced a global agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim (Boehringer) to jointly develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes compounds currently in mid- and late-stage development, including Boehringer’s two investigational oral diabetes agents, linagliptin and empagliflozin. In 2011, linagliptin was approved and launched in the U.S. (trade name Tradjenta), Japan (trade name Trazenta™), Europe (trade name Trajenta®), and other countries. In January 2012, the FDA approved Jentadueto™, a combination of linagliptin and metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Liprotamase—In April, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for the NDA for liprotamase that communicated the need for us to conduct an additional clinical trial prior to a re-submission. We are currently finalizing the study design and anticipate starting a clinical study in 2012. Necitumumab—In February 2011, we and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company stopped enrollment in one of the two global Phase III studies. The decision to stop enrollment in the Phase III non-squamous NSCLC INSPIRE trial (combination treatment with Alimta) followed an independent Data Monitoring Committee recommendation that no new or recently enrolled patients continue treatment in the trial because of safety concerns related to thromboembolism (blood clots) in the experimental arm of the study. The second Phase III study in squamous NSCLC looking at the combination use of necitumumab with Gemzar is continuing. New insulin glargine product—In September, we began the first Phase III clinical trial for our new insulin glargine product. Novel basal insulin analog—In November, we began the first Phase III clinical trial for our novel basal insulin analog. Pomaglumetad Methionil—In February 2011, we began the first Phase III clinical trial for pomaglumetad methionil. Solanezumab—In January 2012, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that we continue the two ongoing Phase III randomized pivotal trials for solanezumab without modifications, based on pre-planned interim safety and futility analyses. The DMC also recommended that we make a protocol modification to EXPEDITION-XT, the open-label extension study of the two Phase III trials, making the protocol for the open-label extension more consistent with the current protocol for the pivotal studies. Acquisition In February 2012, we acquired ChemGen Corp., a privately-held bioscience company specializing in the development and commercialization of innovative feed enzyme products that improve the efficiency of poultry, egg, and meat production. The transaction is not material to our consolidated financial statements. Legal, Regulatory, and Other Matters In October 2011, we announced the withdrawal of our Xigris [drotrecogin alfa (activated)] product in all markets following results of the PROWESS-SHOCK study, which did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with septic shock. We incurred a charge of $85.0 million (pretax), or approximately $.05 per share, for product returns and contractual commitments related to Xigris. Revenue related to Xigris has not been material to our consolidated financial statements. The enactment of the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” (PPACA) and “The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010” in March 2010 brought significant changes to U.S. health care. These changes began to affect our financial results in the first quarter of 2010 and will continue to have significant impact on our results in the future. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide the constitutionality of the PPACA. Oral arguments will take place in March 2012 and a decision is expected in the summer of 2012. Changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to Medicaid beneficiaries, which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent, became effective in the first quarter of 2010. This rebate has been expanded to managed Medicaid, a program that provides for the delivery of Medicaid benefits via managed care organizations, under arrangements between those organizations and state Medicaid agencies. Additionally, a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in certain types of health care facilities that serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B facilities) has been expanded. Beginning in 2011, drug manufacturers provided a discount of 50 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the “doughnut hole” (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage). The doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between 2011 and 2020. Additionally, beginning in 2011, a non-tax-deductible annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. This fee is allocated to companies based on their prior-calendar-year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs. In 2011, we recorded $178.0 million related to this fee, which is included in marketing, selling, and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Also, there are changes to the tax treatment of subsidies paid by the government to employers, such as us, who provide their retirees with a drug benefit at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013, the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. While this tax will not take effect for two more years, accounting rules dictated that we adjust our deferred tax asset through a one-time non-cash charge of $85.1 million upon enactment of the tax law change, which we recorded in the first quarter of 2010. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits as both a policy and political issue increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other measures that would further reduce pharmaceutical companies’ revenue or increase 19 expenses may be enacted. Certain other federal and state health care proposals continue to be debated, and could place downward pressure on pharmaceutical industry sales or prices. We also expect pricing pressures at state levels could become more severe. These federal and state proposals, or state price pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. The Obama Administration has proposed changes to the manner in which the U.S. would tax the international income of U.S.-based companies. There also have been tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change the manner in which, and the rate at which, income of U.S. companies would be taxed. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international income, will continue to be a topic of discussion for Congress and the Obama Administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. In October 2010, Puerto Rico enacted income and excise tax legislation affecting our operations. This tax is included in costs of sales in our consolidated statement of operations. We believe this tax should be creditable against our U.S. income taxes. International operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and several European countries have recently required either price decreases or rebate increases in response to economic pressures. We also anticipate an adverse effect from biennial pricing actions in Japan. There are proposals for cost-containment measures pending in a number of additional countries, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls, limit access to or reimbursement for our products, or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection. Such proposals are expected to increase in both frequency and impact, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets as a result of austerity measures being pursued in a number of countries. OPERATING RESULTS—2011 Revenue Our worldwide revenue for 2011 increased 5 percent, to $24.29 billion, driven by the collective growth of Cymbalta, insulin products, animal health products, Alimta, Effient, and Cialis, offset by the decline in Gemzar and Zyprexa revenue due to the loss of patent exclusivity. Worldwide sales volume increased 6 percent, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates contributed 2 percent of revenue growth, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease due to lower prices. The increase in volume and reduction in price were partially driven by the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for Zyprexa and Gemzar and the agreements to supply authorized versions of olanzapine and gemcitabine. Revenue in the U.S. increased 1 percent, to $12.98 billion, due to higher volume, partially offset by lower prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, to $11.31 billion, due to increased demand and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. In 2011, total revenue was reduced by $408.8 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform. The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2011 compared with 2010: Year Ended December 31, 2011 Year Ended December 31, 2010Total Percent Changefrom 2010 Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total2 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,165.3 $ 2,456.7 $ 4,622.0 $ 5,026.4 (8 ) Cymbalta 3,173.4 988.4 4,161.8 3,459.2 20 Alimta 994.6 1,466.5 2,461.1 2,208.6 11 Humalog 1,398.9 968.7 2,367.6 2,054.2 15 Cialis 704.5 1,171.1 1,875.6 1,699.4 10 Animal health products 896.8 781.8 1,678.6 1,391.4 21 Humulin 588.1 660.7 1,248.8 1,088.9 15 Evista 707.5 359.4 1,066.9 1,024.4 4 Forteo 453.1 496.7 949.8 830.1 14 Strattera 392.2 227.9 620.1 576.7 8 Gemzar 70.6 381.5 452.1 1,149.4 (61 ) Other pharmaceutical products 879.4 1,221.0 2,100.4 1,933.5 9 Total net product sales 12,424.4 11,180.4 23,604.8 22,442.2 5 Collaboration and other revenue3 552.8 128.9 681.7 633.8 8 Total revenue $ 12,977.2 $ 11,309.3 $ 24,286.5 $ 23,076.0 5 1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico. 2 Numbers may not add due to rounding. 3 Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of Erbitux royalties and 50 percent of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S. Zyprexa is a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and bipolar maintenance. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. decreased 13 percent in 2011 due to the loss of patent exclusivity in 20 the U.S. on October 23, 2011. Despite a decline in demand for branded Zyprexa, U.S. volume increased in 2011 primarily as a result of sales of authorized olanzapine in connection with our six-month agreement with Prasco Laboratories. This volume increase was more than offset by significant price reductions attributable both to branded Zyprexa and authorized olanzapine. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 3 percent driven primarily by the loss of patent exclusivity throughout most major markets outside of Japan during 2011, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in Japan. In the five major European countries, which in the aggregate had approximately $900 million in sales in 2011, we lost exclusivity in Spain in April 2011 and in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom in September 2011. Globally, upon loss of exclusivity, we are experiencing generic competition which is causing rapid and severe declines on our Zyprexa sales. In Japan, our second-largest market with approximately $540 million in sales in 2011, our patent expires in December 2015. We anticipate worldwide sales of Zyprexa to decline by at least $3 billion in 2012. Sales of Cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain and the management of fibromyalgia, increased 14 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by increased demand and higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 44 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Alimta, a treatment for various cancers, increased 4 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 17 percent, due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. We expect 2012 sales outside the U.S. to be negatively affected by significant government price reductions in Japan, which is our second largest market for Alimta, and the introduction of generic competition in certain markets. Sales of Humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 14 percent in the U.S., due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 16 percent, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction (also approved in October 2011 for benign prostatic hyperplasia in the U.S.), increased 7 percent in the U.S., primarily due to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 12 percent, driven by increased demand, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and higher prices. Sales of Humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 25 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices for Humulin and increased demand attributable to Humulin ReliOn. Sales outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, due to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, increased 4 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 5 percent, driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men, decreased 9 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 50 percent, primarily due to the increased demand in Japan. Sales of Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and in the U.S. in adults, increased 1 percent in the U.S., due primarily to higher prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 22 percent, driven primarily by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices. Sales of Gemzar, a product approved to treat various cancers, decreased 90 percent in the U.S., due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition, which began in November 2010, following the expiration of the compound patent. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 10 percent, due to generic competition in most major markets. We expect sales to continue to decline in 2012. We report as revenue for Erbitux, a product approved to treat various cancers, the net royalties received from our collaboration partners and our product sales. Our revenues increased 6 percent to $409.2 million in 2011. Prior to the termination of our exenatide collaboration with Amylin in November 2011, we recognized in revenue our 50 percent share of Byetta's gross margin in the U.S. In December 2011, we recognized a pro rata portion of revenue resulting from the termination arrangement. We will continue to recognize 100 percent of Byetta and Bydureon sales outside the U.S. until those markets transition to Amylin on a market-by-market basis over a period beginning no earlier than the second half of 2012 and that will not extend beyond December 31, 2013. We also recognize our sales of Byetta pen delivery devices to Amylin which will continue until no later than the end of 2013. In 2011, we recognized total exenatide revenue of $422.7 million, a decrease of 2 percent. Animal health product sales in the U.S. increased 16 percent, due primarily to increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 27 percent during 2011, driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition of certain Janssen and Pfizer animal health assets in Europe and, to a lesser extent, increased demand for other products and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 21 Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses Gross margin as a percent of total revenue decreased by 2.0 percentage points in 2011 to 79.1 percent. This decrease was due primarily to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which significantly increased cost of sales in 2011, but led to a modest reduction to cost of sales in 2010. Patent expirations for Zyprexa and Gemzar also drove the reduction in gross margin percent. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2011 to $7.88 billion. The increase was driven by the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates. In addition, higher administrative expenses in the U.S. included $178.0 million related to the mandatory pharmaceutical manufacturers' fee associated with U.S. health care reform. Investment in research and development increased 3 percent, to $5.02 billion, due primarily to increased late-stage clinical trial costs, including costs related to the diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. We incurred an IPR&D charge of $388.0 million in 2011, associated with our diabetes collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, compared with $50.0 million in 2010 associated with the in-licensing agreement with Acrux. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $401.4 million in 2011, including charges of $316.4 million primarily related to severance costs from previously announced strategic actions that we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, and a special charge of $85.0 million related to the withdrawal of Xigris. In 2010, we recognized charges totaling $192.0 million for asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges. See Notes 3 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other—net, expense increased $174.0 million to a net expense of $179.0 million in 2011, due primarily to the partial impairment of the acquired IPR&D assets related to liprotamase and Amyvid in 2011 and damages recovered in 2010 from generic pharmaceutical companies related to Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany. Our effective tax rate was 18.7 percent in 2011, compared with 22.3 percent in 2010. The decrease was due to the tax benefit on the IPR&D charge associated with the Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes collaboration, as well as a benefit of $85.3 million primarily from the resolution in 2011 of the IRS audits of tax years 2005-2007, along with certain matters related to 2008-2009. Additionally, the tax rate for 2010 was increased by a one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the prescription drug subsidy of our retiree health plan as part of U.S. health care reform. OPERATING RESULTS—2010 Financial Results We achieved revenue growth of 6 percent to $23.08 billion in 2010, which was primarily driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, animal health products, insulin products, Cialis, and Zyprexa, offset by a decline in Gemzar revenue. Cost of sales and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue, while our investment in research and development grew at a greater rate than revenue and our effective tax rate increased. Net income increased 17 percent to $5.07 billion, and earnings per share increased 16 percent to $4.58 per share, in 2010, as compared to $4.33 billion, or $3.94 per share, in 2009. Net income comparisons between 2010 and 2009 are affected by the impact of several highlighted items. The highlighted items for 2010 are summarized in the Executive Overview. The 2009 highlighted items are summarized as follows: Acquisitions (Note 3) • We incurred acquired IPR&D charges associated with an in-licensing arrangement with Incyte Corporation (Incyte) of $90.0 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.05. Asset Impairments and Related Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Notes 5 and 15) • We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $462.7 million (pretax), which decreased earnings per share by $.29, for asset impairments and restructuring primarily related to the sale of our Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site. • We incurred pretax charges of $230.0 million in connection with the claims of several states related to Zyprexa, which decreased earnings per share by $.13. Revenue Our worldwide revenue for 2010 increased 6 percent, to $23.08 billion, driven by the collective growth of Alimta, Cymbalta, animal health products, insulin products, Cialis, and Zyprexa, offset by a decline in Gemzar revenue. Worldwide sales volume increased 3 percent, while selling prices contributed 2 percent of revenue growth, and the impact of foreign exchange rates was negligible. Revenue in the U.S. increased 5 percent, to $12.87 billion, due to higher prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 7 percent, to $10.21 billion, due to increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. In 2010, total revenue was reduced by $229.0 million due to the impact of U.S. health care reform. 22 The following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2010 compared with 2009: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Total Percent Change from 2010 Product U.S.1 Outside U.S. Total2 (Dollars in millions) Zyprexa $ 2,495.5 $ 2,530.9 $ 5,026.4 $ 4,915.7 2 Cymbalta 2,772.0 687.2 3,459.2 3,074.7 13 Alimta 957.1 1,251.5 2,208.6 1,706.0 29 Humalog 1,222.4 831.8 2,054.2 1,959.0 5 Cialis 658.1 1,041.4 1,699.4 1,559.1 9 Animal health products 775.1 616.3 1,391.4 1,207.2 15 Gemzar 723.3 426.1 1,149.4 1,363.2 (16 ) Humulin 470.8 618.0 1,088.9 1,022.0 7 Evista 681.8 342.6 1,024.4 1,030.4 (1 ) Forteo 499.0 331.0 830.1 816.7 2 Strattera 389.8 186.9 576.7 609.4 (5 ) Other pharmaceutical products 737.4 1,196.3 1,933.5 1,908.1 1 Total net product sales 12,382.3 10,060.0 22,442.2 21,171.5 6 Collaboration and other revenue3 483.3 150.4 633.8 664.5 (5 ) Total revenue $ 12,865.6 $ 10,210.4 $ 23,076.0 $ 21,836.0 6 1 U.S. revenue includes revenue in Puerto Rico. 2 Numbers may not add due to rounding. 3 Collaboration and other revenue is primarily composed of Erbitux royalties and 50 percent of Byetta’s gross margin in the U.S. Zyprexa sales in the U.S. increased 7 percent in 2010, driven by higher prices, partially offset by lower demand. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent driven by lower prices and decreased demand in Europe and Canada, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand in Japan. Sales of Cymbalta increased 9 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 31 percent, driven primarily by increased demand in Japan, Europe, and Canada. Sales of Alimta increased 17 percent in the U.S., due primarily to increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. increased 41 percent, due to increased demand. Demand outside the U.S. was favorably affected by continued strong growth in Japan. Sales of Humalog increased 1 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices, partially offset by the impact of wholesaler buying patterns. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, driven by increased demand primarily in Japan and China. Sales of Cialis increased 6 percent in the U.S., due to higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, due primarily to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales of Gemzar decreased 3 percent in the U.S., due to a rapid and severe decline in sales as a result of generic competition, which began in November 2010, following the expiration of the compound patent. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 31 percent, due primarily to generic competition in most major markets. Sales of Humulin increased 17 percent in the U.S., driven primarily by higher prices and increased demand. Sales outside the U.S. remained essentially flat when compared to 2009, due to lower prices offset by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Evista remained essentially flat in the U.S., due to decreased demand offset by increased prices. Sales outside the U.S. decreased 2 percent, driven by lower prices and lower demand, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Sales of Forteo decreased 4 percent in the U.S., driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 11 percent, due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales of Strattera decreased 13 percent in the U.S., due primarily to lower demand, and to a lesser extent, lower net effective selling prices. Sales outside the U.S. increased 14 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower prices. Worldwide sales of Byetta decreased 11 percent to $710.2 million during 2010 due to competitive pressures in the U.S. and European markets. Our revenues decreased 4 percent to $430.6 million in 2010. Erbitux revenues were $386.1 million in 2010, compared with $390.8 million in 2009. Animal health product sales in the U.S. and outside the U.S. increased 15 percent, due primarily to increased demand for our companion animal and feed additive products. 23 Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses Gross margin as a percent of total revenue increased by 0.5 percentage points in 2010 to 81.1 percent. This increase was due to lower manufacturing costs and higher selling prices, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2010 to $7.05 billion. The increase was driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S., partially offset by lower administrative and litigation expenses and company-wide cost containment efforts. Investment in research and development increased 13 percent, to $4.88 billion, due primarily to charges related to pipeline molecules, including charges related to business development activities and termination of clinical trials. We incurred an IPR&D charge of $50.0 million in 2010, associated with the in-licensing agreement with Acrux, compared with $90.0 million in 2009 resulting from the in-licensing agreement with Incyte. We recognized asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges of $192.0 million in 2010, primarily related to severance and other related costs from previously announced strategic actions we are taking to reduce our cost structure and global workforce. In 2009, we recognized charges totaling $692.7 million for asset impairments, restructuring, and other special charges. See Notes 3, 5, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other—net, expense improved $224.5 million to a net expense of $5.0 million in 2010, due primarily to net gains on equity investments, lower net interest expense, damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, and an insurance recovery associated with the theft of product at our Enfield, Connecticut, distribution center. The effective tax rate was 22.3 percent for 2010, compared with 19.2 percent for 2009. The 2010 increase was driven by $85.1 million in additional tax expense in the first quarter related to U.S. health care reform. The 2009 effective tax rate was reduced due to the tax benefit of asset impairment and restructuring charges associated with the sale of the Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site. FINANCIAL CONDITION As of December 31, 2011, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $6.90 billion compared with $6.73 billion at December 31, 2010. The increase in cash was driven by cash from operations of $7.23 billion, partially offset by net noncurrent investment activity (as cash was invested with maturities greater than one year) of $2.32 billion, dividends paid of $2.18 billion, business and product acquisitions of $1.33 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of $672.0 million. Capital expenditures of $672.0 million during 2011 were $22.3 million less than in 2010. We expect 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $800 million as we invest in the long-term growth of our diabetes-care product portfolio and additional biotechnology capacity while continuing investments to improve the quality, productivity, and capability of our manufacturing, research, and development facilities. Total debt at December 31, 2011, was $6.99 billion, an increase of $60.5 million from December 31, 2010, which was due primarily to the $252.4 million increase in the fair value of hedged debt offset by the full repayment in 2011 of $125.0 million of short-term floating rate debt and $63.7 million in Employee Stock Ownership Plan debentures. In 2012, we plan to retire $1.51 billion of our debt as it matures. Our current debt ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s remain AA- and A2, respectively. Our ratings outlook from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s is stable. Dividends of $1.96 per share were paid in 2011 and 2010. 2011 was the 127th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments. In the fourth quarter of 2011, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2012, the quarterly dividend was maintained at $.49 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2012 of $1.96 per share. As of the fourth quarter of 2011, the U.S. economy continues to recover while concerns have grown regarding the health of the European economy. Worries in Europe have spread beyond the “peripheral” nations to encompass the entirety of the euro area, with many economists believing a recession in the euro area to be probable. Meanwhile, U.S. economic data in the fourth quarter generally exceeded expectations, with housing and employment indicators signaling a strengthening recovery. Still, given the fragility of the economic recovery and the heightened anxiety regarding Europe, the Federal Reserve has maintained its view that accommodative policy is likely to be warranted through 2014. Both domestically and abroad, high sovereign debt levels, sluggish growth, rating downgrades, and ongoing fiscal deficits have spurred efforts at fiscal austerity, notably in Spain, Italy, and Greece. We continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of recent health care legislation; the federal government’s involvement in the U.S. economy; and various international government funding levels. Currently, we believe economic conditions in Europe will not have a material impact on our liquidity. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs, including debt service, capital expenditures, and dividends in 2012. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowings. Because of the high credit quality of our short- and long-term debt, our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected. We currently have $1.24 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which backs our commercial paper program. Various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and the “Financial Expectations for 2012” section, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. 24 We depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. Through 2014, we expect to lose U.S. patent protection for Cymbalta (June 2013) and Evista (March 2014) . Cymbalta could receive an additional six months of exclusivity, based on completion of pediatric studies. Zyprexa and Gemzar have already lost exclusivity in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., Gemzar lost exclusivity in November 2010 and Zyprexa lost exclusivity in October 2011. In addition, we face U.S. patent litigation over Alimta, and it is possible we could lose our exclusivity prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. Refer to the Hatch-Waxman patent litigation discussion in Note 15 and in the “Legal and Regulatory Matters” section below. The loss of exclusivity for Alimta, Cymbalta, or Evista would likely result in generic competition, generally causing a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected product, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The U.S. patent for Humalog expires in May 2013. Humalog is currently protected in Europe only by formulation patents. We do not currently expect the loss of patent protection for Humalog to result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. To date, no company has received approval to market a biosimilar version of Humalog; however, it is difficult to predict the likelihood and impact of biosimilars entering the market. Our goal is to mitigate the effect of these exclusivity losses on our operations, liquidity, and financial position through growth in our patent-protected products that do not lose exclusivity during this period, in emerging markets, in Japan, and in our animal health business. Our expected growth in the emerging markets and Japan is attributable to both the growth of these markets and launches of new products in these markets. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2011 and 2010, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the British pound against the euro. We face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than the local currency. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen). Our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated revenues. Considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would have no material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of foreign currency rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. These calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset, in part, by the results of the derivative instruments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. 25 Our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt, including interest payments1 $ 9,127.8 $ 1,672.0 $ 1,323.5 $ 519.5 $ 5,612.8 Capital lease obligations 60.8 8.0 12.5 11.5 28.8 Operating leases 514.9 111.7 155.1 100.3 147.8 Purchase obligations2 12,694.3 10,791.8 1,258.2 496.5 147.8 Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet3 1,679.7 0.0 549.0 233.0 897.7 Other4 180.5 180.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total $ 24,258.0 $ 12,764.0 $ 3,298.3 $ 1,360.8 $ 6,834.9 1 Our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. We used the interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2011, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps. 2 We have included the following: • Purchase obligations, consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of December 31, 2011. Some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations. • Contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent. 3 We have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. We excluded long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.09 billion, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities. 4 This category consists of various miscellaneous items expected to be paid in the next year, none of which are individually material. The contractual obligations table is current as of December 31, 2011. We expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded. We regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. When we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns. Consistent with revenue recognition accounting guidance, when sales occur we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. This estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have been less than one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales. 26 We establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include Medicaid, managed care, Medicare, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other government programs. We base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by Medicaid. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical Medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g. patent expiries), an evaluation of the current Medicaid rebate laws and interpretations, the percentage of our products that are sold to Medicaid recipients, and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts. Although we accrue a liability for Medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the Medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods. Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. A best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. If our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves. We believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. U.S. sales returns, federally mandated Medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs (Medicaid), and Medicare rebates reduced sales by $2.46 billion, $1.66 billion, and $1.20 billion in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. A 5 percent change in the sales return, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate amounts we recognized in 2011 would lead to an approximate $123 million effect on our income before income taxes. As of December 31, 2011, our sales returns, Medicaid, and Medicare rebate liability was $1.23 billion. Our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Approximately 82 percent and 83 percent of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the U.S. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. returns, rebate, and discount liability balances, including Medicaid (in millions): 2011 2010 Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $ 1,155.3 $ 963.6 Reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates1 4,016.9 2,876.1 Cash payments of discounts and rebates (3,574.3 ) (2,684.4 ) Sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $ 1,597.9 $ 1,155.3 1 Adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 0.3 percent of net sales for each of the years presented. Product Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies Product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. We accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable. We also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we have been and will continue to be largely self-insured for future product liability losses for substantially all our currently marketed products. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims. The litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. Pension and Retiree Medical Plan Assumptions Pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. Retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, expected return on plan 27 assets, and health-care-cost trend rates. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. Annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including an evaluation of the discount rates, expected return on plan assets, and health-care-cost trend rates of other companies; our historical assumptions compared with actual results; an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (approximately 81 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We use an actuarially determined, company-specific yield curve to determine the discount rate. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. If the health-care-cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year, the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2011 annual expense would increase by $15.1 million. A one-percentage-point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the 2011 service cost and interest cost by $12.3 million. If the 2011 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $28.4 million. If the 2011 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $19.2 million. If our assumption regarding the 2011 expected age of future retirees for U.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $35.3 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico, represent approximately 82 percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately 81 percent of total plan assets at December 31, 2011. Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset’s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. There are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPR&D acquired in a business combination, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the “income method,” which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization, to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each project independently. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in the “Late-Stage Pipeline” section. The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some IPR&D assets will become impaired at some time in the future. The estimated future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management’s judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. For example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable 28 income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. A 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $40.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively. FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR 2012 For the full year of 2012, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20. We anticipate that total revenue will be between $21.8 billion and $22.8 billion. This includes an expected decline of more than $3 billion in Zyprexa sales due to patent expirations in most markets outside of Japan. The reduction in revenue due to Zyprexa patent expirations is expected to be partially offset by growth in key franchises including Cymbalta, Cialis, Humalog, Humulin, and Forteo, as well as continued growth of newer products such as Effient, Axiron, and Tradjenta. We also anticipate continued strong, double-digit revenue growth from our Elanco Animal Health business. Both Japan and emerging markets are expected to post continued strong underlying volume growth; however, overall revenue growth in these markets in 2012 will be adversely affected by anticipated pricing actions in Japan and by the expected impact of patent expirations, including Zyprexa, in some emerging market countries. We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 77 percent. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to decline and be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion. Research and development expense is expected to be flat to increasing and in the range of $5.0 billion to $5.3 billion. Other—net, expense is expected to be in a range between net expense of $50 million and net income of $100 million. Operating cash flows are expected to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $800 million, as well as anticipated business development activity and our current dividend. PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995— A CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by us, including those above, are based on management’s belief at the time they are made. However, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially and will depend on, among other things, the continuing growth of our currently marketed products; developments with competitive products; the implementation of U.S. health care reform; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches; asset impairments, restructurings, and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired IPR&D charges; foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions; changes in effective tax rates; wholesaler inventory changes; other regulatory developments, litigation, patent disputes, and government investigations; the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing, importation, and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals; and other factors that may affect our operations and prospects, which are discussed earlier in this section and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements. LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations. The most significant of these are described below. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters, and we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for any of these matters; however, we believe that, except as specifically noted below with respect to the Alimta Hatch-Waxman Act patent challenges, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. Patent Litigation We are engaged in the following U.S. patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act (the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984): • Alimta: Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Teva); APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (APP); and Barr Laboratories, Inc. (Barr) each submitted ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant U.S. patents and data-based pediatric exclusivity period (compound patent licensed from the Trustees of Princeton University and expiring in 2017, concomitant nutritional supplement use patent expiring in 2022) and alleging the patents are invalid. We, along with Princeton, filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Teva, APP, and Barr seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed. In July 2011, the district court entered judgment in our favor, upholding that patent’s validity. The generic manufacturers have appealed this decision. In October 2010, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Teva, APP, Pliva Hrvatska D.O.O., and Barr seeking rulings that our concomitant nutritional supplement use patent is valid and infringed. No trial date has yet been set. In January 2012, we filed a similar lawsuit against Accord Healthcare Inc. We believe the Hatch-Waxman challenges to Alimta are without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation. However, it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation, and accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will prevail. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated 29 results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. We expect a loss of exclusivity for Alimta would result in a rapid and severe decline in future revenues in the relevant market. • Strattera: Actavis Elizabeth LLC (Actavis), Apotex Inc. (Apotex), Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (Aurobindo), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Mylan), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun Ltd.), and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva USA) each submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market generic versions of Strattera prior to the expiration of our relevant U.S. patent and data-based pediatric exclusivity period (expiring in 2017), and alleging that this patent is invalid. In 2007, we brought a lawsuit against Actavis, Apotex, Aurobindo, Mylan, Sandoz, Sun Ltd., and Teva USA in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In August 2010, the court ruled that our patent was invalid; however, in July 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned that decision, upholding the patent. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals denied the generic manufacturers’ petition for rehearing en banc in October 2011, and the deadline for any further appeal has passed. Zydus Pharmaceuticals (Zydus) filed an action in the New Jersey district court in October 2010 seeking a declaratory judgment that it has the right to launch a generic atomoxetine product, based on the district court ruling. We believe that Zydus is subject to the injunction issued by the court of appeals in the Actavis case. Zyprexa Litigation We are a defendant in approximately 40 Zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the U.S. covering approximately 120 plaintiffs. The lawsuits allege a variety of injuries from the use of Zyprexa, with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels. The claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of Zyprexa. Many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug. Approximately 25 of the lawsuits, covering about 30 plaintiffs, are part of a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding before The Honorable Jack Weinstein in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) (MDL No. 1596). In October 2011, a jury trial in a California state court was decided in our favor. We are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of Zyprexa in all these lawsuits and claims. We were served with lawsuits filed by 13 states alleging that Zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood-glucose levels, and that we improperly promoted the drug. We settled the Zyprexa-related claims of all of these states, incurring pretax charges of $230.0 million in 2009 and $15.0 million in 2008. In 2005 and 2006, four lawsuits were filed in the EDNY purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third-party payors, excluding governmental entities, which made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed Zyprexa. These actions were consolidated into a single lawsuit, brought under certain state consumer-protection statutes, the federal civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and common law theories, seeking a refund of the cost of Zyprexa, treble damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. As with the product liability suits, these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of Zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug. In September 2008, Judge Weinstein certified a class consisting of third-party payors, excluding governmental entities and individual consumers, and denied our motion for summary judgment. In September 2010, both decisions were reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the case cannot proceed as a class action and entered a judgment in our favor on plaintiffs’ overpricing claim. The U.S. Supreme Court denied plaintiffs’ petition for certiorari. All remaining claims at issue in these cases have now been resolved. Byetta Litigation We have been named as a defendant in approximately 120 lawsuits involving approximately 480 plaintiffs, primarily seeking to recover damages for pancreatitis experienced by patients prescribed Byetta. We are aware of approximately 530 additional claimants who have not yet filed suit. Approximately 100 of these lawsuits are filed in California and coordinated in a Los Angeles Superior Court. Other Product Liability Litigation We have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol. These claims are covered by insurance, subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Product Liability Insurance Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future. In the past several years, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market. Therefore, for substantially all of our currently marketed products, we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self-insured for future product liability losses. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future. 30 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk You can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate risk) in Item 7 at “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Financial Condition.” That information is incorporated in this report by reference.",2023-12-30 16:23:06.620780
