Competition and the Health Care EnvironmentCompetitionThe markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company’s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers and animal health care companies. The Company’s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company’s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, 5Table of Contentspatents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors’ branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products. Competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown.Pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. Additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet customer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations, and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for the Company’s products in that therapeutic category.The highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company’s products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.Health Care Environment and Government RegulationGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. In the United States, federal and state governments for many years also have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.Against this backdrop, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010 (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)). Various insurance market reforms have since advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. With respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the law increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. The law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a 50% point of service discount to Medicare Part D beneficiaries when they are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called “donut hole”). Approximately $365 million, $385 million and $415 million was recorded by Merck as a reduction to revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the donut hole provision. Beginning in 2019, the 50% point of service discount will increase to a 70% point of service discount in the coverage gap, as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 2018. In addition, the 70% point of service discount will be extended to biosimilar products. Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are now required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. The total annual industry fee was $4.1 billion in 2018 and will decrease to $2.8 billion in 2019 and is currently planned to remain at that amount thereafter. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Company recorded $124 million, $210 million and $193 million of costs within Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the Medicaid rebate final rule that implements provisions of the ACA effective April 1, 2016. The rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price; two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. The impact of changes resulting from the issuance of the rule is not material to Merck at this time. However, the Company is still awaiting guidance from CMS on two aspects of the rule that were deferred for later implementation. These include a definition of what constitutes a product ‘line extension’ and a delay in the participation of the U.S. Territories in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program until April 1, 2020. The Company will evaluate the financial impact of these two elements when they become effective.6Table of ContentsThere is significant uncertainty about the future of the ACA in particular and health care laws in general in the United States. The Company is participating in the debate, and monitoring how any proposed changes could affect its business. The Company is unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the ACA. Depending on the nature of any repeal and replacement of the ACA, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.A number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other financial data to the state. In the case of a California law, manufacturers also are required to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical price transparency and that this focus will continue to exert pressure on product pricing.The Company also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profit margins. In the United States, these include (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA.Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. As an example, health care reform is contributing to an increase in the number of patients in the Medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates. In addition, in the effort to contain the U.S. federal deficit, the pharmaceutical industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls in the Medicare prescription drug program (Part D). In addition, Congress may again consider proposals to allow, under certain conditions, the importation of medicines from other countries. It remains very uncertain as to what proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal budget deficit reduction proposals that would directly or indirectly affect the Company.In the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Merck’s products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As the U.S. payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers.In order to provide information about the Company’s pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the United States. The report provides the Company’s average annual list price and net price increases across the Company’s U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. Efforts toward health care cost containment also remain intense in European countries. The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in Europe attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs by brand. The authorities then use price data from those markets to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the Company’s. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations.7Table of ContentsIn addition, in Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines, which occurred in 2018. Furthermore, the government can order repricings for classes of drugs if it determines that it is appropriate under applicable rules.Certain markets outside of the United States have also implemented other cost management strategies, such as health technology assessments (HTA), which require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement. In the United States, HTAs are also being used by government and private payers.The Company’s focus on emerging markets has continued. Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and related measures, such as compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on the price of pharmaceuticals and constrain market access. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in 2019 to varying degrees in the emerging markets.Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the Company’s efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company’s risk exposure.In addressing cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens’ access to appropriate health care, including medicines.Operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company’s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.The pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement.Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the “breakthrough therapy” designation, which has accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner.The European Union (EU) has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, labeling, advertising, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, enhanced pharmacovigilance monitoring and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU member states. The Company’s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company’s business.The Company’s business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company’s overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company’s business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company’s current in-line products, and the absence 8Table of Contentsof trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process. This has led to a significant expansion of the new products being approved each year. Additionally, in 2017, the government updated the National Reimbursement Drug List for the first time in eight years. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the list evolves, it is likely that in the future, inclusion will require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has led to the acceleration of generic substitution, through a pilot tendering process for mature products that have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval.The Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. (See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of the regulatory approval process.)Access to MedicinesAs a global health care company, Merck’s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that it has an important role to play in helping to improve access to its products around the world. The Company’s efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the Company’s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. In addition, the Company has many far-reaching philanthropic programs. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the United States who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company’s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicine and vaccines. In 2011, Merck launched “Merck for Mothers,” a long-term effort with global health partners to end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck has also provided funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent organization, which has partnered with a variety of organizations dedicated to improving global health.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe Company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on the Company’s ability to transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company’s business, including the new EU General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect on May 25, 2018 and imposes penalties up to 4% of global revenue. Additional laws and regulations enacted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, increases enforcement and litigation activity in the United States and other developed markets, and increases regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving risks which has been certified as compliant with and approved by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Cross-Border Privacy Rules System, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Program, and the Binding Corporate Rules in the EU.DistributionThe Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company’s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of the Company’s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers.Raw MaterialsRaw materials and supplies, which are generally available from multiple sources, are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the Company’s business.9Table of ContentsPatents, Trademarks and LicensesPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company’s marketing of its products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se, pharmaceutical formulations, processes for or intermediates useful in the manufacture of products or the uses of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. Current U.S. patent law provides additional patent term for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by the FDA. The EU also provides an additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product’s Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). Japan provides the additional term for pediatric studies attached to market exclusivity unrelated to patent rights.Patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the Company normally provide market exclusivity.

The Company’s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers and animal health care companies. The Company’s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company’s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors’ branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products. Competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown.Pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. Additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet customer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations, and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for the Company’s products in that therapeutic category.The highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company’s products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.Health Care Environment and Government RegulationGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. In the United States, federal and state governments for many years also have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.6Table of ContentsAgainst this backdrop, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010 (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)). Various insurance market reforms have since advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. With respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the law increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. The law also required pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a 50% point of service discount to Medicare Part D beneficiaries when they are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called “donut hole”). As a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 2018 and effective at the beginning of 2019, the 50% point of service discount increased to a 70% point of service discount in the coverage gap. In addition, this point of service discount was extended to biosimilar products. Merck recorded a reduction to revenue of approximately $615 million, $365 million and $385 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the donut hole provision. Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. The total annual industry fee was $4.1 billion in 2018 and decreased to $2.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to remain at that amount for 2020. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Company recorded $112 million, $124 million and $210 million of costs within Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the Medicaid rebate final rule that implements provisions of the ACA effective April 1, 2016. The rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price; two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. The impact of changes resulting from the issuance of the rule is not material to Merck at this time. However, the Company is still awaiting guidance from CMS on two aspects of the rule that were deferred for later implementation. These include a definition of what constitutes a product ‘line extension’ and a delay in the participation of the U.S. Territories in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program until April 1, 2022. The Company will evaluate the financial impact of these two elements when they become effective.There is significant uncertainty about the future of the ACA in particular and health care laws in general in the United States. The Company is participating in the debate, and monitoring how any proposed changes could affect its business. The Company is unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the ACA. Depending on the nature of any repeal and replacement of the ACA, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.A number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other financial data to the state. Some laws also require manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical price transparency and that this focus will continue to exert pressure on product pricing.The Company also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profit margins. In the United States, these include (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA.Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. As an example, health care reform is contributing to an increase in the number of patients in the Medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates. The pharmaceutical industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls. In addition, Congress and/or the administration may again consider proposals to allow international reference pricing or, under certain conditions, the importation of medicines from other countries.The administration has recently proposed a draft rule that would allow importation of certain lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada. If the rule is finalized as proposed, states or certain other non-federal governmental entities would be able to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization of two-year programs (with the opportunity to extend for two more years). There will be a public comment period on the proposed rule which will expire on March 9, 2020. Following the comment period, the FDA will have to review and finalize its 7Table of Contentsproposal before any states or other parties can submit their plans to comply with the federal rule. If the proposed rule is adopted, it likely will be some time before states or other parties can actually implement importation plans. In October 2018, the administration also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to implement an “International Pricing Index” (IPI) model in the United States for products covered under Medicare Part B. The proposal would: (1) reduce Medicare Part B payments for drugs based on a market basket of international prices; (2) allow private sector vendors to negotiate prices for drugs, take title to drugs, and compete for physician and hospital business; and (3) change the physician reimbursement under Medicare Part B from the current model to eliminate the buy and bill system and instead pay physicians based on a flat fee that approximates the revenue they currently receive from drugs. Public comments on the IPI proposal were accepted through late 2018 and it is unclear when the agency may issue a proposed rule on the IPI model. Adoption of one or both of the proposed rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.It remains uncertain as to what proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal legislative proposals that would directly or indirectly affect the Company.In the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Merck’s products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As the U.S. payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers.In order to provide information about the Company’s pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the United States. The report provides the Company’s average annual list price, net price increases, and average discounts across the Company’s U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2019, the Company’s gross U.S. sales were reduced by approximately 44% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns. Efforts toward health care cost containment also remain intense in European countries. The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in Europe attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs by brand. The authorities then use price data from those markets to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the Company’s drugs. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations.In addition, in Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines, which occurred in 2018 and will occur again in 2020. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. Pursuant to those rules, the Japanese government reduced the price of Keytruda by 17.5% effective February 2020. Additionally, Keytruda will be subject to another significant price reduction in April 2020 under a provision of the Japanese pricing rules.The Company’s business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company’s overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company’s business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company’s current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the 8Table of Contentscomplexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year. Additionally, in 2017, the Chinese government updated the National Reimbursement Drug List for the first time in eight years. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the list evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. In 2019, drugs were added through two pathways, direct inclusion and price negotiations. For price negotiations, price reductions of approximately 60% on average were required for inclusion. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume based procurement (VBP). In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into the first two rounds of VBP have had, on average, a price reduction of 50%. The expansion of the VBP program remains to be seen.The Company’s focus on emerging markets, in addition to China, has continued. Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and related measures, such as compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on the price of pharmaceuticals and constrain market access. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in 2020 to varying degrees in the emerging markets, including China.Certain markets outside of the United States have also implemented other cost management strategies, such as health technology assessments (HTA). Examples include the UK, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact, and the economic and social impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national health care system of the individual country is conducted. HTAs generally focus on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the health care system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTAs will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to medicinal products by the regulatory authorities of individual European Union (EU) Member States. A negative HTA of one of the Company’s products by a leading and recognized HTA body could undermine the Company’s ability to obtain reimbursement for such product in the EU Member State in which such negative assessment was issued, and also in other EU Member States. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement. In the United States, HTAs are also being used by government and private payers.Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the Company’s efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company’s risk exposure.In addressing cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens’ access to appropriate health care, including medicines.Operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company’s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.The pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement.9Table of ContentsOf particular importance is the FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the “breakthrough therapy” designation, which has accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner.The EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, labeling, advertising, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, enhanced pharmacovigilance monitoring and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU member states. In particular, EU regulators may approve products subject to a number of post-authorization conditions. Examples of typical post-authorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, the establishment of patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribing arrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the imposition of financial penalties. The Company’s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company’s business.The Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. (See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of the regulatory approval process.)Access to MedicinesAs a global health care company, Merck’s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that it has an important role to play in helping to improve access to its medicines, vaccines, and to quality health care around the world. The Company’s efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the Company’s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. In addition, through innovative social investments, including philanthropic programs and impact investing, Merck is also helping to strengthen health systems and build capacity, particularly in under-resourced communities. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the United States who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company’s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicines and vaccines. In 2011, Merck launched “Merck for Mothers,” a long-term effort with global health partners to end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck has also provided funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent grantmaking organization, which has partnered with a variety of organizations dedicated to improving global health.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe Company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on the Company’s ability to transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company’s business, including both the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect on May 25, 2018 and imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective January 1, 2020. Additional laws and regulations enacted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, increased enforcement and litigation activity in the United States and other developed markets, and increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving risks which has been certified as compliant with and approved by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Cross-Border Privacy Rules System, the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Programs, and the Binding Corporate Rules in the EU.DistributionThe Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy 10Table of Contentsbenefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company’s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of the Company’s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers.Raw MaterialsRaw materials and supplies, which are generally available from multiple sources, are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the Company’s business.Patents, Trademarks and LicensesPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company’s marketing of its products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se, pharmaceutical formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of products, or the uses of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. Current U.S. patent law provides additional patent term for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by the FDA.

a worldwide, except Japan, collaboration with Pfizer Inc. 6Table of ContentsCompetition and the Health Care EnvironmentCompetitionThe markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company’s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company’s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company’s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors’ branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products.Pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for the Company’s products in that therapeutic category.The highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company’s products as well as competitors’ products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.Health Care Environment and Government RegulationGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. United StatesIn the United States, federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain state and federal entities such as the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.Health Care ProgramsThe United States enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010 (the ACA). Various insurance market reforms have since advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. With respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the law increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. The law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 70% of the cost of the medicine, including biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called “donut hole”), which increased from 50% beginning in 2019 as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 2018. Merck recorded approximately $700 million, $615 million and $365 million as a reduction to revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, related to the donut hole provision. Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. The total annual industry fee has been set at $2.8 billion. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Company recorded approximately $85 million, $112 million, and $124 million of costs within Selling, general and administrative 7Table of Contentsexpenses in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the Medicaid rebate final rule that implemented provisions of the ACA effective April 1, 2016. The rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price; two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. More recently, although CMS previously declined to define what constitutes a product “line extension” (beyond the statutory definition), CMS issued a new rule on December 21, 2020 that will significantly expand the definition of the term “line extension” as of January 1, 2022 to include a broad range of products, including products reflecting new strengths, dosage forms, release mechanisms, and routes of administration. This expanded definition will increase the number of drugs subject to a higher Medicaid rebate. Effective January 1, 2023, this final rule also changes the way that manufacturers must calculate Best Price, in relation to certain patient support programs, including coupons, which also may result in an increase in the Company’s Medicaid rebates. The impact of these and other provisions in this final rule could adversely impact the Company’s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care ActThere is significant uncertainty about the future of the ACA in particular and health care laws in general in the United States. In December 2018, a Texas federal district court struck down the ACA on the grounds that the individual health insurance mandate is unconstitutional. The United States Supreme Court heard arguments in this case on November 10, 2020.The Company is participating in the health care debate and monitoring how any proposed changes could affect its business. The Company is unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the ACA. Depending on the nature of any changes to the ACA, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.Other Legislative ChangesIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. A number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other financial data to the state. Some laws also require manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical price transparency and that this focus will continue to exert pressure on product pricing.Drug PricingThe Company also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profit margins, including, in the United States (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA.In November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a Final Rule that would, effective January 1, 2023, eliminate the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) on behalf of such plans. While the Company cannot anticipate the effects of this change to the way it currently contracts, this new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans. This rulemaking also established, effective January 1, 2021, a new safe harbor for point of sale discounts at the pharmacy counter and a new safe harbor for certain services arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs.CMS also recently issued an Interim Final Rule (the MFN Rule) that alters how physicians will be reimbursed under the Medicare program for physician administered drugs. Pursuant to the MFN Rule, which was intended to be effective January 1, 2021, rather than use the current Average Sales Price (ASP)-based payment framework for certain physician-administered drugs, the MFN Rule would institute a new pricing system for certain prescription drugs and biologic products covered by Medicare Part B in which Medicare would reimburse no more than the “most favored nation price,” meaning the lowest price after adjusting for volume and differences in gross domestic product, for the top 50 Part B reimbursed products, which includes Keytruda, sold in 22 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Several organizations, including two 8Table of Contentstrade groups of which Merck is a member, have filed suit challenging this regulation. Those lawsuits remain pending with a preliminary injunction having been entered in one of the cases. At this time, the Company cannot predict with any certainty if or when the MFN Rule will go into effect. Implementation of the MFN Rule could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.The FDA also recently issued rulemaking allowing the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada through FDA-authorized, time-limited programs sponsored by states or Native American tribes recognized under the rule, and, in certain future circumstances, pharmacists and wholesalers. The FDA also recently released final guidance for industry detailing procedures for drug manufacturers to import FDA-approved prescription drug, biological, and combination products that were manufactured abroad and authorized and intended for sale in a foreign country. A trade organization, in which Merck is a member, brought suit, which remains pending in federal district court, challenging the commercial importation rule. These proposed changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. As an example, health care reform has contributed to an increase in the number of patients in the Medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates. The pharmaceutical industry also could be considered a potential source of savings via other legislative and administrative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls. There was active consideration of drug-pricing related legislation in the last Congress, and it remains very uncertain as to what proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal legislative proposals that would directly or indirectly affect the Company.In the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and PBMs have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Merck’s products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As the U.S. payor market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors.In order to provide information about the Company’s pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the United States. The report provides the Company’s average annual list price, net price increases, and average discounts across the Company’s U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2020, the Company’s gross U.S. sales were reduced by 45.5% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns. European UnionEfforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in the European Union (EU). The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs. Reference pricing may either compare a product’s prices in other markets (external reference pricing), or compare a product’s price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing). The authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the Company’s drugs. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed 9Table of Contentspursuant to local regulations. Some EU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit control plans. Others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In some EU Member States, cross-border imports from low-priced markets also exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State.Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement plans vary widely from Member State to Member State. Some EU Member States provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapies or so-called health technology assessments (HTA), in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The HTA of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in most EU Member States. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public health impact, therapeutic impact and/or the economic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the individual country is conducted. Ultimately, HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. The outcome of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of the Company’s products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force the Company to reduce its reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates. A negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine the Company’s ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, to inform their pricing and reimbursement decisions. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, the Company may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of the Company’s product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of the Company’s products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.BrexitIn 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of that referendum and subsequent negotiations, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transitional period applied from January 31, 2020 until December 31, 2020, and during this period the EU and UK operated as if the UK was an EU Member State, and the UK continued to participate in the EU Customs Union allowing for the freedom of movement for people and goods.It was announced on December 24, 2020, that the EU and the UK agreed to a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). The TCA sets out the new arrangements for trade of goods, including medicines and vaccines, which allows goods to continue to flow between the EU and the UK. On December 29, 2020, the Council of the EU adopted the decision to sign the TCA and for the TCA to be provisionally applied from January 1, 2021. The UK and EU signed the TCA on December 30, 2020. In order for the TCA to be ratified and formally come into effect, the Council of the EU must unanimously approve the TCA and the European Parliament must consent to it, which the Company believes will occur. As a result of the TCA, the Company believes that its operations will not be materially adversely affected by Brexit. 10Table of ContentsJapanIn Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. The next government-mandated price reduction will occur in April 2021 and is expected to impact many Company products.ChinaThe Company’s business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company’s overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company’s business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company’s current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year. Additionally, in 2017, the Chinese government updated the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) for the first time in eight years. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the list evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. In 2020, drugs were added to the NRDL through double-digit price reductions. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume based procurement (VBP). In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into the first three rounds of VBP have had, on average, a price reduction of 50%. The Company expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward.Emerging MarketsThe Company’s focus on emerging markets, in addition to China, has continued. Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in the emerging markets.Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the Company’s efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, credit worthiness of health care partners, such as hospitals, due to COVID-19, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company’s risk exposure.In addressing cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens’ access to appropriate health care, including medicines.Operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company’s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and 11Table of Contentsits business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.RegulationThe pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement.Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the “breakthrough therapy” designation, which has accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner.The EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU member states. In particular, EU regulators may approve products subject to a number of post-authorization conditions. Examples of typical post-authorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, the establishment of patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribing arrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the imposition of financial penalties. The Company’s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company’s business.The Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. (See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of the regulatory approval process.)Access to MedicinesAs a global health care company, Merck’s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that it has an important role to play in helping to improve access to its medicines, vaccines, and to quality health care around the world. The Company’s efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the Company’s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. In addition, through innovative social investments, including philanthropic programs and impact investing, Merck is also helping to strengthen health systems and build capacity, particularly in under-resourced communities. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the United States who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company’s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicines and vaccines. Merck has funded “Merck for Mothers,” a long-term effort with global health partners to end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck has also provided funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent grantmaking organization, which has partnered with a variety of organizations dedicated to improving global health.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe Company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on the Company’s ability to transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company’s business, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, (GDPR) which went into effect in May 2018 and imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue. 12Table of ContentsThe GDPR and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States govern the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that the Company processes. It also imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (which includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Further, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of data protection, including to the United States, except if the data controller meets very specific requirements. Following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on July 16, 2020, there is considerable uncertainty as to the permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. In light of the implications of this decision, the Company may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries.Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised.There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against the Company, harm to its reputation, and adversely impact its business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that the Company faces with regard to data protection regulation.Additional laws and regulations enacted in the United States (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act), Europe, Asia and Latin America, have increased enforcement and litigation activity in the United States and other developed markets, as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving risks and facilitate the transfer of personal information across international borders.DistributionThe Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, PBMs and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company’s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of the Company’s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers.Patents, Trademarks and LicensesPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company’s marketing of its products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se, pharmaceutical formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of products, or the uses of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. Current U.S. patent law 13Table of Contentsprovides additional patent term for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by the FDA. The EU also provides an additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product’s Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). Japan provides the additional term for pediatric studies attached to market exclusivity unrelated to patent term.Patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the Company normally provide market exclusivity. The Company has the following key patent protection in the United States, the EU, Japan and China (including the potential for patent term extensions (PTE) and SPCs where indicated) for the following marketed products:ProductYear of Expiration (U.S.)Year of Expiration (EU)(1)Year of Expiration (Japan)(2)Year of Expiration (China)Januvia202320222025-20262022Janumet20232023N/A2022Janumet XR2023N/AN/A2022Isentress20242023(3)2022-20262022SimponiN/A(4)2024(5)N/A(4)N/A(4)Lenvima(6)2025(3) (with pending PTE)2021 (patents), 2026(3) (SPCs)20262021Adempas(7)2026(3)2028(3)2027-20282023Bridion2026(3) (with pending PTE)20232024ExpiredNexplanon2027 (device)2025 (device)N/A2025Bravecto2027 (with pending PTE)2025 (patents), 2029 (SPCs)20292033Gardasil20282021(3)ExpiredN/AGardasil 920282025 (patents), 2030(3) (SPCs)N/A2025Keytruda20282028 (patents), 2030(3) (SPCs)2032-20332028Lynparza(8)2028(3) (with pending PTE)2024 (patents), 2029(3) (SPCs)2028-20292024Zerbaxa2028(3)2023 (patents), 2028(3) (SPCs)2028 (with pending PTE)N/ASivextro20282024 (patents), 2029 (SPCs)20292024Belsomra2029(3)N/A2031N/APrevymis2029(3) (with pending PTE)2024 (patents), 2029(3) (SPCs)2029N/ASegluromet(9)2031 (with pending PTE)2029 (patents), 2034 (SPCs)N/A(10)N/ASteglatro(9)2031(3) (with pending PTE)2029 (patents), 2034(3) (SPCs)N/A(10)2029Steglujan(9)2031 (with pending PTE)2029 (patents), 2034 (SPCs)N/A(10)N/AVerquvo(7)2031 (with pending PTE)N/A(11)N/A(11)N/A(11)Delstrigo2032 (with pending PTE)2031 (patents), 2033 (SPCs)N/AN/APifeltro2032 (with pending PTE)2031 (patents), 2033 (SPCs)20362031Recarbrio2033(3) (with pending PTE)N/AN/AN/ANote: Compound patent unless otherwise noted.

Molnupiravir has not been approved by the FDA but has been authorized for emergency use.(3) Being jointly developed and commercialized in a worldwide collaboration with Bayer AG. 6Table of ContentsCompetition and the Health Care EnvironmentCompetitionThe markets in which the Company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. The Company’s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company’s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company’s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors’ branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products.Pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for the Company’s products in that therapeutic category.The highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company’s products as well as competitors’ products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.Health Care Environment and Government RegulationGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform enacted in prior years, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company’s revenue performance in 2021 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. In the U.S., the Biden Administration and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect revenue performance.United StatesThe Company faces increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profit margins, including, through (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).In the U.S., federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain state and federal entities such as the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.7Table of ContentsAdditionally in the U.S., consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Merck’s products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been increasing the cost-sharing required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As the U.S. payor market concentrates further, pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors.In order to provide information about the Company’s pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the U.S. The report provides the Company’s average annual list price, net price increases, and average discounts across the Company’s U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2021, the Company’s gross U.S. sales were reduced by 43.5% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns. Legislative ChangesIn 2021, Congress actively considered multiple versions of drug pricing legislation that could significantly impact branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. This legislation would implement a government negotiation plan for certain products covered by Medicare Parts B and D, institute financial penalties for price increases above inflation, and redesign the Medicare Part D program to include a cap on patients’ out of pocket costs and realign the liability for costs of the benefit among manufacturers, health plans, and the government. It is unclear when or if this legislation will be passed by Congress, and it remains very uncertain as to what other proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal legislative proposals that would directly or indirectly affect the Company.Also in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. These rebates act as a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer discounts paid to Medicaid can increase. Prior to this change, manufacturers have not been required to pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) in rebates to state Medicaid programs for Medicaid-covered drugs. As a result of this provision, beginning in 2024, it is possible that manufacturers may have to pay state Medicaid programs more in rebates than they received on sales of particular products. This change could present a risk to Merck in the future for drugs that have high Medicaid utilization and rebate exposure that is more than 100% of the AMP.The Company also faces increasing pricing pressure in the states, which are looking to exert greater influence over the price of prescription drugs. A number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other financial data to the state. Some laws also require manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical pricing and will increasingly shift to more aggressive price control tools such as Prescription Drug Affordability Boards that have the authority to conduct affordability reviews and establish upper payment limits.Regulatory ChangesIn February 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the Medicaid rebate final rule that implemented provisions of the ACA effective April 1, 2016. The rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of AMP and Best Price, two metrics used to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. On December 21, 2020, CMS issued a final rule making significant changes to these requirements. Effective January 1, 2023, this final rule changes the way that manufacturers must calculate Best Price in relation to certain patient support programs, including coupons. PhRMA, a pharmaceutical industry trade group of which the Company is a member, filed a complaint challenging this rule as invalid asserting that it conflicts 8Table of Contentswith the plain language of the Medicaid drug rebate statute. Should this legal challenge fail, the impact of this and other provisions in this final rule could adversely impact the Company’s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.In November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General issued a Final Rule that would, effective January 1, 2023, eliminate the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to PBMs on behalf of such plans. While the Company cannot anticipate the effects of this change to the way it currently contracts, this new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans. This rulemaking also established, effective January 1, 2021, a new safe harbor for point of sale discounts at the pharmacy counter and a new safe harbor for certain service arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs. Congress has delayed implementation of this Final Rule until January 1, 2026 and pending federal legislation would repeal it entirely.The pharmaceutical industry also could be considered a potential source of savings via other legislative and administrative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls. European UnionEfforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in the European Union (EU). The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs. Reference pricing may either compare a product’s prices in other markets (external reference pricing), or compare a product’s price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing). The authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the Company’s drugs. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations. Some EU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit control plans. Others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In some EU Member States, cross-border imports from low-priced markets also exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State.Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement plans vary widely from Member State to Member State. Some EU Member States provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapies or so-called health technology assessments (HTA), in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The HTA of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in most EU Member States. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public health impact, therapeutic impact and/or the economic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the individual country in which it is conducted. Ultimately, HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. The outcome of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of the Company’s products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force the Company to reduce its reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates. A negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine the Company’s ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, to inform their pricing and reimbursement decisions. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.9Table of ContentsTo obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, the Company may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of the Company’s product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of the Company’s products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.BrexitIn 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of that referendum and subsequent negotiations, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transitional period applied from January 31, 2020 until December 31, 2020, and during this period the EU and UK operated as if the UK was an EU Member State, and the UK continued to participate in the EU Customs Union allowing for the freedom of movement for people and goods.It was announced on December 24, 2020, that the EU and the UK agreed to a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). The TCA sets out the new arrangements for trade of goods, including medicines and vaccines, which allows goods to continue to flow between the EU and the UK. The TCA was signed on December 30, 2020, was applied provisionally as of January 1, 2021, and entered into force on May 1, 2021. As a result of the TCA, the Company believes that its operations will not be materially adversely affected by Brexit. JapanIn Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. The next government-mandated price reduction will occur in April 2022.ChinaThe Company’s business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company’s overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company’s business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company’s current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the government’s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. In 2021, drugs were added to the NRDL with an average of more than 60% price reductions. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume based procurement (VBP). In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into the last five rounds of VBP had, on average, a price reduction of more than 50%. The Company expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward.Emerging MarketsThe Company’s focus on emerging markets, in addition to China, has continued. Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses (especially for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs), that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in the emerging markets.Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the Company’s efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing 10Table of Contentsavailability of funding for health care, credit worthiness of health care partners, such as hospitals, due to COVID-19, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company’s risk exposure.In addressing global cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens’ access to appropriate health care, including medicines.Operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company’s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.RegulationThe pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement.Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S., which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the U.S. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the “breakthrough therapy” designation, which has accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner.The EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU Member States. In particular, EU regulators may approve products subject to a number of post-authorization conditions. Examples of typical post-authorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, the establishment of patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribing arrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the imposition of financial penalties. The Company’s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company’s business.The Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. (See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of the regulatory approval process.)Access to MedicinesAs a global health care company, Merck’s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that, in collaboration with key stakeholders, it has a role to play in helping to ensure that its science advances health care, and its products are accessible and affordable. The Company is committed to ensuring a reliable, safe global supply of its quality medicines and vaccines, and to developing, testing and implementing innovative solutions that address barriers to access and affordability of its medicines and vaccines. The Company’s approach is designed to enable it to serve the greatest number of patients today, while 11Table of Contentsmeeting the needs of patients in the future. The Company’s efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the Company’s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. In addition, through innovative social investments, including philanthropic programs and impact investing, Merck is also helping to strengthen health systems and build capacity, particularly in under-resourced communities. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the U.S. who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company’s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicines and vaccines. Merck has funded “Merck for Mothers,” a long-term effort with global health partners to end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck has also provided funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent grantmaking organization, which has partnered with a variety of organizations dedicated to improving global health.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe Company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on the Company’s ability to transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company’s business, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in May 2018 and imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue. The GDPR and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States govern the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that the Company processes. It also imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (which includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Further, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of data protection, including to the U.S., except if the data controller meets very specific requirements. Following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the EU on July 16, 2020, there is considerable uncertainty as to the permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. In light of the implications of this decision, the Company may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries.Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both the EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised.There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against the Company, harm to its reputation, and adversely impact its business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that the Company faces with regard to data protection regulation.On August 20, 2021, China’s 13th National People’s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) that aims to standardize the handling of personal information in China which became effective on November 1, 2021. The PIPL currently applies to the processing of personal information of natural persons in China, the processing of personal information outside China where the purpose is to provide products and services in China, and to analyze the activities of individuals in China. While similar to the GDPR, the PIPL contains unique requirements not found in the GDPR.12Table of ContentsThe Company has developed and implemented comprehensive plans to ensure compliance with the PIPL, with those relating to data localization and cross-border transfers yet to be completed pending forthcoming guidance from the Cyberspace Administration of China.Additional laws and regulations enacted in the U.S. (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act), Europe, Asia, and Latin America, have increased enforcement and litigation activity in the U.S. and other developed markets, as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving requirements and risks and to facilitate the transfer of personal information across international borders.DistributionThe Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, PBMs and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company’s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of the Company’s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers.Patents, Trademarks and LicensesPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company’s marketing of its products in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se, pharmaceutical formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of products, or the uses of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the U.S. for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. Current U.S. patent law provides additional patent term for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by the FDA. The EU also provides an additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product’s Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). Japan provides the additional term for pediatric studies attached to market exclusivity unrelated to patent term.Patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the Company normally provide market exclusivity. The Company has the following key patent protection in the U.S., the EU, Japan and China (including the potential for patent term extensions (PTE) and SPCs where indicated) for the following marketed products:13Table of ContentsProductYear of Expiration (U.S.)Year of Expiration (EU)(1)Year of Expiration (Japan)(2)Year of Expiration (China)Januvia202320222025-20262022Janumet20232022N/A2022Janumet XR2023N/AN/A2022Isentress20242023(3)2022-2026(4)2022SimponiN/A(5)2024(6)N/A(5)N/A(5)Lenvima(7)2025(3)2026(3) (SPCs)2026ExpiredBridion2026(3)20232024ExpiredBravecto2026 (with pending PTE)2025 (patents), 2029 (SPCs)20292025Gardasil2028ExpiredExpiredN/AGardasil 920282025 (patents), 2030(3) (SPCs)N/A2025Keytruda20282030(3)2032-20332028Lynparza(8)2028(3) (with pending PTE)2024 (patents), 2029(3) (SPCs)2028-20292024Zerbaxa2028(3)2023 (patents), 2028(3) (SPCs)2028 (with pending PTE)N/AAdempas(9)N/A(10)2028(3)2027-20282023Belsomra2029(3)N/A2031N/APrevymis2029(3) (with pending PTE)2024 (patents), 2029(3) (SPCs)2029N/ASegluromet(11)2031 (with pending PTE)2029 (patents), 2034 (SPCs)N/A(12)2029Steglatro(11)2031(3) (with pending PTE)2029 (patents), 2034(3) (SPCs)N/A(12)2029Steglujan(11)2031 (with pending PTE)2029 (patents), 2034 (SPCs)N/A(12)2029Verquvo(8)2035 (with pending PTE)N/A(13)N/A(13)N/A(13)Vaxneuvance2031 (with pending PTE)No PatentN/AN/ADelstrigo2032 (with pending PTE)2031 (patents), 2033 (SPCs)N/A2031Pifeltro2032 (with pending PTE)2031 (patents), 2033 (SPCs)20362031Recarbrio2033(3) (with pending PTE)N/AN/AN/AWelireg2035 (with pending PTE)N/AN/AN/ANote: Compound patent unless otherwise noted.

310158,MRK,"Merck & Co., Inc.",2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation EXECUTIVE SUMMARY About the Company: Schering-Plough is a worldwide pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing, manufacturing and marketing new therapies and treatments to enhance human health. The Company’s primary business strategy is to continually discover or license human pharmaceutical products that are patent protected for an extended period of time. When a product’s patent expires, generic competition occurs, resulting in a substantial decline in a product’s average selling price. Schering-Plough also has leading consumer product brands in the over-the-counter (OTC), foot care and sun care markets and has a global animal health business. Government regulatory agencies throughout the world regulate the Company’s discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing efforts. The Food and Drug Administration in the United States (FDA) is a pivotal regulator of the Company’s business. In the United States, the pricing of the Company’s pharmaceutical products is subject to competitive pressure as managed care organizations seek price discounts. Also in the United States, the Company is required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans’ health care program and other government-funded programs. In most international markets, the Company operates in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs. The Company ships its pharmaceutical products to wholesalers and distributors, but markets these products to health care professionals, managed care organizations and, to a lesser extent, patients themselves. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Company are the percentage market shares for its products. Market shares for the Company’s major products are discussed in the sections that follow. The current state of the Company: During the past three years, the Company experienced a confluence of negative events, which are summarized as follows: • Since 2001, the Company has been working with the FDA to resolve issues involving the Company’s compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at certain of its manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. In 2002, the Company reached a formal agreement with the FDA for a consent decree. Under the terms of the consent decree, the Company agreed to make payments totaling $500 million and to revalidate the manufacturing processes at these sites. These manufacturing sites have remained opened throughout this period; however, the consent -32- Table of Contents decree has placed significant additional controls on production and release of products from these sites, including review and third-party certification of production variances, and, for some products, review and third-party certification of batch production records. The third-party certifications and other cGMP improvement projects have resulted in higher costs as well as reduced output at these facilities. In addition, the Company has found it necessary to discontinue certain older products. The impact of the consent decree is discussed in more detail in the sections that follow. • Certain of the Company’s sales and marketing practices are under investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. These investigations pose significant risks to the Company and have caused the Company to significantly increase its litigation reserves. These matters are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow. • In December 2002, the Company switched all formulations of CLARITIN in the United States from prescription to OTC status. This switch followed the loss of marketing exclusivity for the product. The average unit selling price for an OTC product is much lower than the price in the prescription market. Further, with the loss of marketing exclusivity, the Company faces additional competition from comparable brands and generics in the OTC marketplace. CLARITIN in the United States had been the Company’s leading product in terms of sales, and even more so in terms of profit. As a result, the Company has experienced a rapid, sharp and material decline in earnings and cash flow beginning in 2003. The Company does not expect earnings to recover from the loss of sales of CLARITIN until such time as the Company introduces new products. Recovery may take several years. • The Company’s other leading franchise is the combination of pegylated interferon (PEG-INTRON) and ribavirin (REBETOL) to treat hepatitis C. In late 2002, a competitor entered the hepatitis C marketplace with its own versions of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Prior to the introduction of these competing products, the Company held a leading position in the hepatitis C market. With the introduction of this competitor, the Company’s market shares have fallen significantly. This decline in sales has exacerbated the overall earnings and cash flow decline. In addition, generic forms of REBETOL may be approved at any time in the important U.S. market. If this were to occur, the Company’s market shares and sales would decline further. -33- Table of Contents The above matters have resulted in the following: • Cash flow has declined significantly, particularly in the United States, where the majority of research is conducted and from where dividends are paid. Also, payments arising from the investigations being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Offices could further reduce cash flow in the United States. In addition, the Company’s credit ratings have been reduced. The impact of the lower credit ratings and the Company’s overall liquidity is discussed in detail in the sections that follow. • The Company’s manufacturing sites operate well below optimum levels due to sales declines and the reduction in output related to the consent decree. At the same time, overall costs of operating the manufacturing sites have increased due to the consent decree activities. The impact of these facts is a reduction in profit margins. At this time, the major investments in manufacturing capacity are not impaired; however, the Company continues to review the carrying value of these assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairment losses and accelerated depreciation due to shortened asset lives. In response to the above, the Company has initiated the following actions: • A new management team has been appointed and has implemented many changes, some of which are described in the following sections. • The quarterly dividend has been reduced to 5.5 cents from 17 cents per common share. • A program entitled Value Enhancement Initiative (VEI) has commenced. VEI is a tool designed to enable the Company to save and spend wisely. The key cost-cutting initiatives implemented include: Ø Eliminating most employee bonuses for 2003 under the Company’s standard plans. Ø Eliminating the payout under the Company’s profit sharing plan. Ø Eliminating routine merit increases throughout 2004, with exceptions only where local contracts or practices prevent this action, for customer-contact employees, for employees dedicated to fulfillment of the Company’s FDA consent decree obligations and other business-critical employees. Ø Targeting an overall reduction in payroll and related expenses of at least 10 percent, again excluding payroll expense associated with customer-contact employees and employees dedicated to fulfilling the Company’s FDA consent decree obligations. The first step toward achieving this target was a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the United States. Approximately 900 employees elected to retire under this program. Ø Installing global procurement programs. Ø Exercising tight controls over new hires, cutting back in travel costs and reducing meeting expenses. -34- Table of Contents On a positive side, the Company is entering the cholesterol-reduction market with the launch of ZETIA (ezetimibe) and the U.S. marketing application for ezetimibe/simvastatin combination, which was submitted for filing in September 2003. The cholesterol-reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Management believes that these products have the potential of enabling the Company to move beyond the loss of CLARITIN and to build long term financial strength. In addition, the Company believes that it has several potentially valuable pharmaceutical compounds in its earlier stage research pipeline. The Company is also aggressively pursuing licensing opportunities with other research-based pharmaceutical companies. Outlook: Year-over-year comparisons between 2004 and 2003 will be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including the following: • The Company experienced downward slopes in sales and market share of several of its key profit-generating products throughout much of 2003. • The Company is making significant investments in sales and marketing support aimed at stabilizing market shares of its key profit-generating products. • The Company expects generic competition for REBETOL in the U.S. market to begin in 2004. • The contraction of the worldwide hepatitis C market that began in 2003 may continue in 2004. • The absence of LOSEC revenues from Europe due to the end of the agreement with AstraZeneca in the third quarter of 2003. LOSEC revenues were $130 million in 2003. The ability of the Company to rebuild its financial strength is highly dependent upon the success of the cholesterol joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck). If this joint venture is highly successful, then the Company may be able to rebuild its financial strength and turn around its operating performance beginning in 2005. If the joint venture is not highly successful, then the Company must rely on the success of its early-stage pipeline drugs, licensing opportunities, a significant change in corporate strategy or some combination of these. The reader should note that there is significant uncertainty inherent in any of the factors that could enable the Company to rebuild its financial strength. NET SALES Consolidated net sales in 2003 totaled $8.3 billion, a decrease of $1.8 billion or 18 percent compared with the same period in 2002. Consolidated net sales reflected a volume decline of 22 percent, a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 5 percent and an unfavorable price impact of 1 percent. Net sales in the United States decreased 38 percent versus 2002 and net sales internationally advanced 8 percent. International sales included a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 11 percent. -35- Table of Contents Consolidated 2002 net sales of $10.2 billion increased $418 million or 4 percent versus 2001, reflecting a price increase impact of 3 percent and a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 1 percent. Sales volume in 2002 was unchanged versus 2001. Net sales by major therapeutic category for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: (Dollars in millions) % Increase (Decrease) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Anti-infective & Anticancer $ 3,098 $ 3,733 $ 2,273 (17 %) 64 % Allergy & Respiratory 2,003 3,304 4,217 (39 ) (22 ) Cardiovasculars 467 433 623 8 (30 ) Dermatologicals 507 511 593 (1 ) (14 ) Other Pharmaceuticals 597 807 715 (26 ) 13 Global Pharmaceuticals 6,672 8,788 8,421 (24 ) 4 OTC 563 269 178 N/M 51 Foot Care 275 279 291 (1 ) (4 ) Sun Care 127 167 178 (24 ) (5 ) Consumer Health Care 965 715 647 35 11 Animal Health 697 677 694 3 (2 ) Consolidated net sales $ 8,334 $ 10,180 $ 9,762 (18 %) 4 % N/M – Not a meaningful percentage. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Net sales of global anti-infective and anticancer products decreased 17 percent compared with 2002. Sales of the INTRON franchise, used primarily for the treatment of hepatitis C, decreased 32 percent to $1.9 billion due to market share declines, changes in U.S. trade inventory levels and lower sales in Japan. Market share of the INTRON franchise has been declining, reflecting the entrance of a competitor’s new products in the hepatitis C market in 2003. Also, as previously reported, the Company anticipates potential generic competition in the United States for REBETOL in 2004. U.S. sales of REBETOL were $306 million in 2003. The INTRON franchise includes the anticancer/antiviral agent INTRON A Injection, as monotherapy and in combination with REBETOL Capsules for treating hepatitis C, and PEG-INTRON Powder for Injection, a longer-acting form of INTRON A, as monotherapy and in combination with REBETOL for treating hepatitis C. Net sales in the anti-infective and anticancer therapeutic category benefited from international sales of REMICADE, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis. Net sales of REMICADE were up $203 million or 60 percent to $540 million, primarily in Europe, due to increased patient utilization. Global sales of TEMODAR Capsules, for treating certain types of brain tumors, increased 16 percent to $324 million due to increased market penetration. International sales of CAELYX, a long-circulating pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride, increased 55 percent to $111 million due to increased -36- Table of Contents patient utilization coupled with the ongoing launch of a new indication for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who are at increased cardiac risk. In 2002, net sales of global anti-infective and anticancer products rose 64 percent compared with 2001, led by the October 2001 market introduction of PEG-INTRON in combination with REBETOL for hepatitis C in the United States, the continued rollout of this combination therapy in European markets and the December 2001 launch of REBETOL in combination with INTRON A in Japan. Sales in the anti-infective and anticancer category in 2002 also benefited from higher international sales of REMICADE and global sales of TEMODAR, reflecting increased market penetration. Global net sales of allergy and respiratory products decreased 39 percent in 2003 and 22 percent in 2002. This category of sales was negatively impacted by the rapid decline in sales of prescription CLARITIN, resulting from its loss of market exclusivity in the United States along with conversion from prescription to OTC status in December 2002. In 2003, global sales of prescription CLARITIN were $370 million, compared with $1.8 billion in 2002 and $3.2 billion in 2001. U.S. sales of prescription CLARITIN recognized in 2003 were $25 million versus sales of $1.4 billion in 2002 and $2.7 billion in 2001. Global net sales of CLARINEX for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year-round indoor allergies were $694 million in 2003, an increase of 16 percent, reflecting the continued conversion of patients from prescription CLARITIN to CLARINEX, coupled with the launch of CLARINEX in several international markets. These factors were tempered by contraction of the U.S. prescription antihistamine market following the launch of OTC CLARITIN as well as by changes in U.S. trade inventory levels. CLARINEX continues to experience intense competition in the U.S. allergy market. Global sales of CLARINEX were $598 million in 2002. CLARINEX was launched in the United States in January 2002. Net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once-daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, decreased 4 percent to $500 million in 2003 due to changes in U.S. trade inventory levels and market share declines in the United States. NASONEX is experiencing intense competition in the U.S. allergy market. International sales of NASONEX grew 21 percent to $199 million due to market share gains. Net sales of NASONEX in 2002 were essentially flat versus 2001 due to market share declines in the United States, tempered by market share gains in international markets. Global net sales of cardiovascular products increased 8 percent in 2003. Sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes, increased 1 percent to $306 million due to increased patient utilization in the United States, tempered by a decline in U.S. trade inventory levels. In 2002, global net sales of cardiovascular products decreased 30 percent due to lower sales of K-DUR, a sustained-release potassium chloride supplement, which is subject to generic competition. Partially offsetting this decline were higher sales of INTEGRILIN due to increased patient utilization and increased market penetration. Net sales of consumer health care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased $250 million or 35 percent in 2003 and increased $68 million in 2002. OTC product net sales increased $294 million in 2003 and $91 million in 2002 due to the launch of OTC -37- Table of Contents CLARITIN in December 2002. Sales of OTC CLARITIN were $415 million in 2003 and $105 million in 2002. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company began to face additional private-label competition for OTC CLARITIN, as the initial 180-day period of exclusivity expired for the first OTC generic competitor. The comparison of 2002 versus 2001 was negatively impacted by manufacturing issues for other OTC products. Net sales of foot care products decreased $4 million or 1 percent in 2003 due to the nonrecurrence of the 2002 launch of LOTRIMIN ULTRA, a topical antifungal. Foot care sales decreased 4 percent in 2002 due to increasing competition, tempered by the launch of LOTRIMIN ULTRA. Net sales of sun care products decreased $40 million or 24 percent in 2003, primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions in the United States. Sun care sales decreased 5 percent in 2002 due to lower sales of BAIN DE SOLEIL products. Global net sales of animal health products increased 3 percent in 2003 to $697 million. Sales were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of 7 percent, offset by continued manufacturing supply issues, described in “Additional Factors Influencing Operations” below. Global net sales of animal health products decreased 2 percent in 2002 due to challenging global market conditions, coupled with manufacturing issues. -38- Table of Contents SUMMARY OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND EQUITY INCOME (Dollars in millions) % Increase (Decrease) 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Cost of sales $ 2,833 $ 2,505 $ 2,078 13 % 21 % % of net sales 34.0 % 24.6 % 21.3 % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,474 $ 3,681 $ 3,444 (6 %) 7 % % of net sales 41.7 % 36.2 % 35.3 % Research and development $ 1,469 $ 1,425 $ 1,312 3 % 9 % % of net sales 17.6 % 14.0 % 13.4 % Other (income) expense, net $ 59 $ (144 ) $ (95 ) N/M 51 % % of net sales 0.7 % (1.4 %) (1.0 %) Special charges $ 599 $ 150 $ 500 N/M (70 %) % of net sales 7.2 % 1.5 % 5.1 % Equity income from cholesterol joint venture $ (54 ) $ — $ — N/M — % of net sales (0.7 %) — — N/M - Not a meaningful percentage. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2003 increased over 2002, primarily due to a change in product sales mix resulting from the loss of U.S. sales of prescription CLARITIN. The increase was also the result of higher unit manufacturing costs, including the effect of lower production volumes, coupled with increased spending for the Company’s cGMP compliance efforts. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2002 increased over 2001, primarily due to a shift in sales towards products on which royalties are paid and higher costs associated with manufacturing issues. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 6 percent to $3.5 billion in 2003 versus $3.7 billion in 2002. The decrease was mostly due to lower marketing expenses in the global pharmaceutical business, including zero payout of profit sharing and routine bonuses. In addition, field force incentives also declined. These decreases were tempered by higher promotion for OTC CLARITIN and foreign exchange. The ratio to net sales of 41.7 percent in 2003 was higher than the ratio of 36.2 percent in 2002, primarily due to lower overall sales reported in 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7 percent in 2002, and the ratio to net sales increased to 36.2 percent from 35.3 percent in 2001 due to increased spending to support the continued rollout of new and recently introduced products in international markets. Research and development spending increased 3 percent to $1.5 billion, representing 17.6 percent of net sales in 2003. Research and development expenses increased 9 percent to $1.4 -39- Table of Contents billion and represented 14.0 percent of net sales in 2002. The changes in spending in both years reflect the timing of the Company’s funding of both internal research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. The change in 2003 also reflects the presentation of research and development costs related to the cholesterol collaboration with Merck under the equity method of accounting, as discussed below. In 2003, Other (income) expense, net included higher net interest expense. Other (income) expense, net in 2002 included $80 million of income related to the sale of the Company’s U.S. marketing rights for SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX sublingual tablets for the treatment of opioid dependence. (See the “Other (Income) Expense, Net” footnote for additional information.) SPECIAL CHARGES The components of special charges are as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Employee termination costs $ 179 $ — $ — Asset impairment losses 70 — — Litigation charges 350 150 — Consent decree charge — — 500 $ 599 $ 150 $ 500 -40- Table of Contents Employee Termination Costs In August 2003, the Company announced a global workforce reduction initiative. The first phase of this initiative was a VERP in the United States. Under this program, eligible employees in the United States had until December 15, 2003, to elect early retirement and receive an enhanced retirement benefit. Approximately 900 employees elected to retire under the program, of which approximately 750 employees retired at or near year-end 2003 and approximately 150 employees have staggered retirement dates in the future. The total cost of this program is estimated to be $190 million, comprised of increased pension costs of $107 million, increased post-retirement health care costs of $57 million, vacation payments of $4 million and costs related to accelerated vesting of stock grants of $22 million. For employees with staggered retirement dates in the future, these amounts will be recognized as a special charge over the employees’ remaining service periods. This delayed expense recognition follows the guidance in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” Amounts recognized in 2003 for this program were $164 million, and amounts expected to be recognized in 2004 and 2005 are $19 million and $7 million, respectively. The expected cash expenditures associated with this program are $25 million and $7 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Also included in employee termination costs in the above table are $15 million of other employee severance costs. In December 2003, the Company announced that it is targeting an overall reduction in payroll and related expenses of at least 10 percent, excluding payroll expenses associated with customer-contact employees and employees dedicated to fulfilling the Company’s FDA consent decree obligation. This target includes savings realized from the VERP. The Company expects to incur additional employee termination costs in 2004 associated with achieving its goal of reducing payroll and related expenses. Savings expected to be realized from these actions approximate $150 million annually. The Company expects to reinvest a significant portion of these savings by expanding its sales forces to maximize the ZETIA and ezetimibe/simvastatin opportunities and further support NASONEX, REMICADE and the INTRON franchise. Asset Impairment Losses Asset impairment losses have been recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” and SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Asset impairment losses related to the following: • The Company ceased production of certain products produced at one of its manufacturing sites operating under the FDA consent decree. The Company also announced the closure of its manufacturing site in England. All manufacturing at the site in England has substantially ceased. Sales of all the affected products have -41- Table of Contents not been material. An asset impairment loss of $26 million based on discounted cash flows has been recognized related to the facilities and equipment at these two sites. • The Company has ceased marketing a licensed cancer therapy drug that was sold in countries outside the United States. Sales of this product declined and are not material. The introduction of competing products has resulted in a decline in the market share of the Company’s drug to the point where management concluded that it was no longer practical to continue to participate in this marketplace. An asset impairment loss of $27 million based on discounted cash flows has been recognized related to this intangible asset. • One of the Company’s sun care brands competes in the “high-end” segment of the overall sun care market. Two large cosmetics companies have entered this market segment, and sales of the Company’s brand have declined. When the Company acquired this brand, a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the trade name based upon its fair value at that time. The Company performs periodic reviews of all values assigned to intangible assets and, in connection with those reviews, an impairment loss of $17 million related to the trade name has been recognized based on discounted cash flows. This reflects the change in market conditions since this brand was acquired. Sales of this sun care brand have not been material. Litigation Charges In 2003 and 2002, litigation reserves have been increased by $350 million and $150 million, respectively, primarily as a result of the investigations into the Company’s sales and marketing practices (see “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote for additional information). Consent Decree Charge In 2001, a provision of $500 million was recognized for payments to the federal government under a consent decree (see “Consent Decree” footnote for additional information). -42- Table of Contents Summary of Selected Special Charges The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to employee termination costs and asset impairment losses: (Amounts in millions) Employee Asset Termination Impairment Costs Losses 2003 Special charges $ 179 $ 70 Impairment write-off — (70 ) Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (144 ) — Cash disbursement (6 ) — Special charges accrual balance at Dec. 31, 2003 $ 29 $ — The balance at December 31, 2003, for employee termination costs represents the value of stock grants ($22 million), which will be distributed after year-end 2003, and severance and accrued vacation payments to be paid in 2004 ($7 million). EQUITY INCOME FROM CHOLESTEROL JOINT VENTURE Effective in 2003, the Company is presenting its collaboration with Merck to jointly develop and market ZETIA and ezetimibe/simvastatin combination following the equity method of accounting. Under that method, the Company records its share of the operating profits less its share of research and development costs in Equity income from cholesterol joint venture. Included in this line for the full year 2003 are the Company’s share of the operating profits of $113 million and a $20 million milestone receipt, less its share of research and development costs of $79 million. It should be noted that the Company incurs substantial costs, such as selling costs, that are not reflected in Equity income from cholesterol joint venture and are borne entirely by the Company. ZETIA was launched in the United States and several international markets in November 2002. Several additional market launches have occurred to date. Global sales of ZETIA were $471 million in 2003. Prior to 2003, the venture was in the research and development phase and the Company’s share of research and development expense in 2002 and 2001 of $69 million and $86 million, respectively, was reported in “Research and development” in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. NET (LOSS)/INCOME Net (loss)/income was a loss of ($92) million in 2003 versus income of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net (loss)/income in 2003 includes special charges of $599 million, as described above. Net income in 2002 includes the $150 million pre-tax provision to increase litigation reserves, and 2001 includes the $500 million pre-tax provision for the consent decree payments. These provisions are both included in special charges. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE For the full year 2003, the effective tax rate was 15 percent excluding the $350 million non-tax deductible provision to increase litigation reserves. The effective tax rate was 23 percent for 2002 and 2001. The Company reduced its effective tax rate in 2003 due to the decrease in profits, primarily in the United States. For additional information, see the “Income Taxes” footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the potential early termination of the swaps discussed in “Liquidity and Financial Resources” may result in a higher effective tax rate in 2004 and beyond. (LOSS)/EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Diluted (loss)/earnings per common share decreased to a loss of ($0.06) in 2003 and increased 2 percent to earnings of $1.34 in 2002. The weakening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies increased growth in earnings per common share in 2003 and 2002. Diluted earnings per share in 2003 and 2002 reflect favorable exchange impacts of $0.05 and $0.01, respectively. The Company advises that the trend in earnings should be viewed with and without the aforementioned special charges and the impact of year-to-year changes in foreign exchange rates. -43- Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Background The following background information may be useful to the reader in understanding the current state of the Company’s liquidity and financial resources. At December 31, 2003, approximately 86 percent of all cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments shown in the accompanying balance sheet was held by wholly owned, foreign-based subsidiaries. At the same time, substantially all of the debt shown in the accompanying balance sheet was owed by the parent company or wholly owned, U.S.-based subsidiaries. In years prior to 2003, this geographic disparity between the location of the funds and the location of debt was not a pivotal issue for the Company. However, with the material decline in earnings following the loss of marketing exclusivity of CLARITIN in the United States, this geographic disparity has taken on more importance. Cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term investments, exceeded total debt at December 31, 2003 by $1.4 billion. However, using the funds held by the foreign-based subsidiaries for the cash needs of the U.S.-based subsidiaries may result in U.S. income tax payments. The amount of any U.S. income tax payments would depend upon a number of factors, including the amount of the funds used and whether the U.S. operations were generating taxable profits or losses. In 2003, the U.S. operations generated tax losses, primarily due to the decline of CLARITIN sales and the continued investment in research and development. For 2003, the entire amount of the U.S. tax losses will be used to recoup taxes paid in previous years (carryback benefit). In 2004, management expects the U.S. operations to again generate tax losses. However, only a portion of these losses is expected to be used to recoup taxes paid in previous years because, under current law, the carryback benefit will be exhausted. The amount of the expected 2004 loss in excess of that used to recoup taxes paid in previous years becomes available to reduce taxable income in the future (carryforward benefit). When the U.S. operations generate losses that cannot be used to recoup taxes paid in previous years, the Company has a choice. It can either use the carryforward benefits in future years, or utilize some or all of those losses to absorb taxable distributions to the U.S. of cash or other assets held by the foreign-based subsidiaries. Absorbing the U.S. operating losses in this manner allows a portion of the assets held by the foreign-based subsidiaries to become available for use in the U.S. operations without having to make U.S. income tax payments. As discussed below, the Company expects to finance a portion of its cash needs in 2004 and possibly beyond by accessing some of the funds held by the foreign-based subsidiaries. The funds that the Company expects to access represent foreign earnings to be generated in 2004 and beyond. The Company does not expect to incur additional U.S. income taxes when accessing these funds because these taxable distributions will be absorbed by the expected U.S. operating -44- Table of Contents losses. Further, as described below, the Company may make additional taxable distributions of funds held by the foreign-based subsidiaries to the U.S. operations because the Company has triggered the credit rating downgrade provisions in certain of its financing arrangements. The Company may incur additional U.S. income taxes because these additional distributions from the foreign-based subsidiaries may exceed the U.S. operating losses. Discussion of Cash Flow Cash provided by operating activities totaled $601 million in 2003, $1,980 million in 2002 and $2,512 million in 2001. Cash provided by operating activities declined in 2003 due to lower sales of CLARITIN, lower sales of the products within the INTRON franchise and higher manufacturing costs. A portion of the cash flow impact of lower sales was mitigated by the collection of accounts receivable that followed the decline in sales. Cash provided by operating activities in 2003 also includes the second payment of $250 million relating to the FDA consent decree. In previous filings, the Company had reported that, for 2003 and possibly beyond, cash provided by operating activities would not be sufficient to fund working capital, capital expenditures and dividends, if these items remained at the then-current levels. In response to the decline in sales and earnings in 2003 as well as the likelihood of further declines in 2004, the Company announced on August 21, 2003, a reduction in the quarterly dividend from 17 cents to 5.5 cents per common share. This action saves approximately $170 million per quarter beginning with the fourth quarter of 2003. On that same day, the Company also announced accelerated and intensified cost-cutting actions, including a global workforce reduction effort. As shown in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for 2003, cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures and dividends exceeded cash from operations. This excess of cash needs over cash generation occurred entirely within the U.S. operations where the deficit was approximately $1,400 million. Foreign operations generated cash in excess of cash needs. In 2003, the Company borrowed additional funds in the United States to finance the U.S. operations while continuing to accumulate cash with the foreign-based subsidiaries. In 2004, management expects its foreign operations to generate cash and its U.S. operations to have cash needs. However, excluding any potential payments arising from the litigation and investigations discussed below, the U.S. deficit in 2004 is expected to decline. For 2004, dividend payments will be approximately $500 million less than in 2003, and the Company expects to receive a tax refund in excess of $400 million for the carryback benefit described above. Approximately $600 million of cash was available in the U.S. at December 31, 2003 to pay down commercial paper balances or fund the U.S. operations. The above discussion does not take into consideration any payments that may arise from the matters described in the “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote included in the financial statements to this report. In particular, the Company has accrued material amounts with respect to the investigations being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Pennsylvania and -45- Table of Contents Massachusetts and with respect to the dispute with the IRS. At this time, management cannot estimate the ultimate amounts or timing of such potential payments with certainty. Any such payments would increase the cash needs of the U.S. operations and may necessitate additional financing, repatriation of funds held by foreign-based subsidiaries or a combination of the two. These matters may also affect the Company’s credit ratings and its ability to access commercial paper. If the Company’s current cash management strategy and capital structure remain unchanged beyond 2004, management expects both the cash held by the foreign-based subsidiaries and the debt owed by the U.S.-based subsidiaries to increase. Management is in the process of evaluating whether the present strategies and structure are the most appropriate in light of the increasing debt levels as well as the changing portfolio of the Company’s products. Management believes the Company possesses sufficient financial resources to meet all of its financial needs. The Company has in excess of $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, albeit held by foreign-based subsidiaries, as well as sizable lines of credit with commercial banks, as described below. Further, management believes the Company has continuing access to the capital markets. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On November 26, 2003, the Company issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. Proceeds from this offering of $2.4 billion are being used for general corporate purposes, including to repay commercial paper outstanding in the United States. Upon issuance, the notes were rated A3 by Moody’s Investors’ Service (Moody’s) and A+ (on CreditWatch with negative implications) by Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moody’s or S&P is downgraded below “A3” or “A-,” respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes will increase. See the “Financial Instruments and Commitments” footnote included in the financial statements to this report for additional information. The Company has three revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion. The most recently negotiated facility (September 2003) is a $1 billion, 364-day credit facility from three major financial institutions that can be drawn down in the United States. This facility matures in September 2004. The other facilities are with a syndicate of financial institutions and provide for $500 million that can be drawn down in the United States through May 2004 with repayment due May 2005, and a second multi-currency facility for $500 million that can be drawn down in the United States and internationally through the maturity date in May 2006. At December 31, 2003, no funds were drawn under any of these facilities. At December 31, 2003, short-term borrowings totaled $1,023 million. Approximately 92 percent of this was outstanding commercial paper. The commercial paper ratings discussed below have not significantly affected the Company’s ability to issue or roll over its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as the -46- Table of Contents Company, with one or more short-term credit ratings of “P-2” from Moody’s, “A-2” from S&P and/or “F2” from Fitch Ratings (Fitch) to issue or roll over outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short-term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to such issuers is typically less than that of higher rated companies. The Company maintains sizable lines of credit with commercial banks, as well as cash and short-term investments held by foreign-based subsidiaries, to serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. Credit Ratings On December 17, 2003, S&P lowered the Company’s corporate credit and long-term debt ratings to “A” from “A+” and said the outlook on the ratings was negative, noting a weakening in the Company’s INTRON franchise and expected declines in earnings and cash flows. There was no change in the Company’s short-term corporate credit and commercial paper rating, which was lowered to “A-1” from “A-1+” on July 29, 2003. On January 26, 2004, S&P placed the Company’s corporate credit rating, short-term credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating on CreditWatch with negative implications. On February 18, 2004, S&P downgraded the Company’s senior unsecured debt ratings to “A-” from “A.” At the same time, S&P also lowered the Company’s short-term corporate credit and commercial paper rating to “A-2” from “A-1.” S&P removed the Company from CreditWatch, however, its outlook remains negative. On October 9, 2003, Moody’s lowered the Company’s corporate credit rating to “A-3” from “A-1” and lowered its commercial paper rating to “P-2” from “P-1.” Following this rating action, Moody’s removed the Company from its Watchlist and revised its rating outlook to stable from negative. Moody’s also stated that its credit rating assumed modest outflows to settle outstanding litigation or acquisitions and that a very large payment associated with litigation proceedings or acquisition activity could place pressure on the rating and/or outlook. On November 20, 2003, Fitch downgraded the Company’s senior unsecured and bank loan ratings to “A-” from “A+,” and its commercial paper rating to “F2” from “F1.” The Company’s Rating Outlook remained negative. In announcing the downgrade, Fitch noted that the sales decline in the Company’s leading product franchise, the INTRON franchise, was greater than anticipated, and that it was concerned that total Company growth is reliant on the performance of two key growth drivers, ZETIA and REMICADE, in the near term. -47- Table of Contents Financial Arrangements Containing Credit Rating Downgrade Triggers The Company has two separate arrangements that enable it to manage cash flows between its U.S. subsidiaries and its foreign-based subsidiaries. Both of these arrangements employ interest rate swaps, and both of these arrangements have similar credit rating downgrade triggers which allow the counterparty to call for early termination. The credit rating downgrade triggers require the Company to maintain a long-term debt rating of at least “A2” by Moody’s or “A” by S&P. Both S&P’s and Moody’s current credit ratings are below this specified minimum. As a result, the counterparty to the interest rate swaps can elect early termination following a specified period, as described below. One of the arrangements utilizes two long-term interest rate swap contracts, one between a foreign-based subsidiary and a bank and the other between a U.S. subsidiary and the same bank. The two contracts have equal and offsetting terms and are covered by a master netting arrangement. The contract involving the foreign-based subsidiary permits the subsidiary to prepay a portion of its future obligation to the bank, and the contract involving the U.S. subsidiary permits the bank to prepay a portion of its future obligation to the U.S. subsidiary. Interest is paid on the prepaid balances by both parties at market rates. Prepayments totaling $1.9 billion have been made under both contracts as of December 31, 2003. The prepaid amounts have been netted in the preparation of the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.” This arrangement provides that in the event the Company fails to maintain the required minimum credit ratings, the counterparty may terminate the transaction by designating an early termination date not earlier than 36 months following the date of such notice to terminate. However, if such notice is given, the early termination consequences discussed below would occur at the end of the three-year period. Early termination requires repayment of all prepaid amounts, and repayment must occur in the original tax jurisdiction in which the prepaid amounts were made. Accordingly, early termination would require the Company’s U.S. subsidiary to repay $1.9 billion to the bank and for the bank to repay $1.9 billion to the Company’s foreign-based subsidiary. The financial impact of early termination depends on the manner and extent to which the Company decides to finance its U.S. repayment obligation. The Company could finance its entire obligation by obtaining short- or long-term financing in the United States. (In this case, cash and debt would increase by equal amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.) However, the Company’s ability to finance its obligation under the swaps will depend on the Company’s credit ratings and business operations, as well as market conditions, at the time such financing is contemplated. Alternatively, the Company could repatriate to the United States some or all of the funds received by the foreign-based subsidiary. Repatriating funds could have U.S. income tax consequences depending primarily on profitability of the U.S. operations. Any such tax would be accrued against future earnings, and may result in the Company reporting a higher effective tax rate. Currently, the U.S. operations are generating tax losses. However, future tax -48- Table of Contents losses may be insufficient to absorb any or all of the potential tax should the Company repatriate some or all of the funds received by the foreign-based subsidiary. As stated above, termination of the transaction cannot occur earlier than 36 months following the date on which the Company receives a termination notice from the counterparty. Accordingly, early termination is not imminent. Due to this fact, as well as the alternative courses of action available to the Company in the event of early termination, the potential of early termination does not impact current liquidity and financial resources. The second arrangement utilizes long-term interest rate swap contracts, one entered into in 1991 with a notional principal of $650 million and a second entered into in 1992 with a notional principal of $950 million. The terms of these contracts enable the Company to sell the right to receive payments while retaining the obligation to make payments. In 1991 and 1992, the U.S. parent company sold the rights to receive payments under both contracts to a foreign-based subsidiary in return for approximately $700 million (fair value). This intercompany transaction has been eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. (The Internal Revenue Service has asserted that these transactions were not a sale but a loan on which additional U.S. income taxes are due. The Company expects to litigate this matter as described in the “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote to the financial statements.) The contracts allow the counterparty to effectively terminate the transaction if the Company fails to maintain the required minimum credit ratings and within 60 days does not restore at least one of the required minimum credit ratings. The Company’s credit rating fell below the required minimum credit rating on February 18, 2004. It is unlikely the Company will restore at least one of its credit ratings in the allotted time. Early termination of these contracts due to a credit rating downgrade would most likely result in the U.S. parent company reacquiring the right to receive payments from its foreign-based subsidiary and terminating the transaction with the counterparty on a net basis. The reacquisition of the rights to receive payments under the swap contracts would occur either by the U.S. parent company buying back the rights for their fair market value or by having the foreign-based subsidiary dividend the rights back to the U.S. parent company. Buying back the rights would necessitate funding in the United States, which the Company currently estimates would be approximately $450 million. In this case, cash and debt would increase by equal amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. Alternatively, having the foreign-based subsidiary dividend the rights back to the U.S. parent company could result in additional U.S. income taxes. Presently, the U.S. operations of the Company are generating tax losses. These losses are expected to exceed the value of the intercompany dividend necessary to reacquire the rights. As a result, in the event of early termination, management has the alternative of reacquiring the rights and terminating the transaction with the counterparty without materially impacting liquidity or financial resources. Accordingly, management does not view early termination of this arrangement to be a material event impacting current liquidity and financial resources. -49- Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments due by period under the Company’s known contractual obligations at December 31, 2003, are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Payments due by period Less More than 1-3 3-5 than Total 1 year years years 5 years Long-term debt obligations (1) $ 2,410 $ — $ 14 $ 5 $ 2,391 Operating lease obligations 281 69 105 67 40 Purchase obligations: Advertising contracts 95 95 — — — Research contracts (2) 132 132 — — — Capital expenditure commitments 193 184 9 — — Other purchase orders (3) 925 880 45 — — Other recorded long-term liabilities (4) 517 29 23 19 446 Total $ 4,553 $ 1,389 $ 196 $ 91 $ 2,877 (1) Long-term debt obligations include the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2013 and $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2033. See “Financial Instruments and Commitments” footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) Research contracts do not include any potential milestone payments to be made since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by the Company without penalty. (3) Other open purchase orders consist of both cancelable and noncancelable inventory and expense items. (4) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of the Company’s pension plans that do not hold qualified assets and estimated payments under the Company’s deferred compensation plans. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company has responsibilities for environmental cleanup under various state, local and federal laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Environmental expenditures have not had and, based on information currently available, are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company. For additional information, see the “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. -50- Table of Contents ADDITIONAL FACTORS INFLUENCING OPERATIONS In the United States, many of the Company’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In most international markets, the Company operates in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs. In the U.S. market, the Company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government-funded programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods to control costs. Since the Company is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the United States, their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company cannot predict what net effect the Medicare prescription drug benefit will have on markets and sales. The program does not go into effect until 2006 and many of the Company’s leading drugs are already covered under Medicare Part B (e.g. TEMODAR, INTEGRILIN and INTRON A). Others have a relatively small portion of their sales to the Medicare population (e.g. CLARINEX, the hepatitis C franchise). The Company could experience expanded utilization of ZETIA and new drugs in the Company’s R&D pipeline. Of greater consequence for the Company may be the legislation’s impact on pricing, rebates and discounts. A significant portion of net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the United States. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. The Company’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, new products of competitors and generic competition as the Company’s products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. As noted in the “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote included in the financial statements to this report, the Company has sued drug manufacturers that are marketing or seeking to market certain forms of generic loratadine prior to the expiration of the Company’s compound patent for desloratadine. In each case, the Company has filed suit in federal court seeking a ruling that the applicable Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) or “paper” New Drug Application submission and proposed marketing of a generic prescription or OTC product -51- Table of Contents constitute infringement of the Company’s patents and that the challenge to the patents is without merit. The compound patent for loratadine expired on June 19, 2002, and U.S. market exclusivity for CLARITIN expired on December 19, 2002. A patent covering the compound desloratadine, formulations thereof, and methods of treatment with desloratadine as it relates to CLARITIN is set to expire on April 21, 2004. Six months’ U.S. market exclusivity would attach to the end of the desloratadine patent as it relates to CLARITIN and would expire on October 21, 2004. This six-month period of exclusivity was granted because the Company conducted pediatric clinical trials at the request of the FDA. On August 8, 2002, a federal district court in New Jersey ruled on motions for summary judgment, finding that certain of the desloratadine compound patent claims, which the Company believes protect CLARITIN, were anticipated by a prior patent and, thus, were not valid. On August 1, 2003, the district court’s decision was sustained by the appellate court, and on October 28, 2003, the appellate court denied the Company’s petition for rehearing. With these rulings, actions against the defendants for infringement of the desloratadine compound patent by manufacturers of loratadine will not proceed. The Company had also asserted that ANDAs filed by two manufacturers for generic versions of CLARITIN-D 24 Hour infringe the Company’s patent covering CLARITIN-D 24 Hour. The Company settled this litigation with Impax and ANDRX in October 2003 and has licensed them under this patent. On November 27, 2002, the Company announced that all five formulations of the CLARITIN brand of non-drowsy allergy products had been approved at their original prescription strengths by the FDA as OTC medicines for the treatment of allergies. The Company also has been informed by the FDA that the New Drug Applications (NDAs) for these CLARITIN formulations, as well as for all indications (allergies and hives), will be transferred from the FDA’s Pulmonary Division Office of Drug Evaluation II to the Division of Over-the-Counter Drug Products Office of Drug Evaluation V. The Company launched OTC CLARITIN in the United States in December 2002. Also in December 2002, a competing OTC loratadine product was launched in the United States. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company began to face additional private-label competition for its OTC CLARITIN line of nonsedating antihistamines, as the initial 180-day period of exclusivity expired for the first OTC generic competitor. The Company continues to market CLARINEX (desloratadine) 5 mg Tablets for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, which combines the indication of seasonal allergic rhinitis with the indication of perennial allergic rhinitis, as well as the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria, or hives of unknown cause. The ability of the Company to capture and maintain market share for CLARINEX and OTC CLARITIN in the U.S. market will depend on a number of factors, including: additional entrants in the market for allergy treatments; clinical differentiation of CLARINEX from other allergy treatments and the perception of the extent of such differentiation in the marketplace; the pricing differentials among OTC CLARITIN, CLARINEX, other allergy treatments and generic OTC loratadine; the erosion rate of OTC CLARITIN and CLARINEX sales upon the entry of additional generic OTC loratadine products; and whether or not one or both of the other branded second-generation antihistamines are switched from prescription to OTC status. CLARINEX is experiencing intense competition in the prescription U.S. allergy market. The prescription allergy market has been shrinking since the OTC switch of CLARITIN -52- Table of Contents in December 2002. The Company is implementing new marketing efforts to address market share performance for CLARINEX. The switch of CLARITIN to OTC status and the introduction of competing OTC loratadine has resulted in a rapid, sharp and material decline in CLARITIN sales in the United States and the Company’s results of operations. U.S. sales of prescription CLARITIN products were $25 million or 0.3 percent of the Company’s consolidated global sales in 2003 and $1.4 billion or 14 percent in 2002. Sales of CLARINEX in the United States and abroad have also been materially adversely affected by the presence of generic OTC loratadine and OTC CLARITIN. In light of the factors described above, management believes that the Company’s December 2002 introduction of OTC CLARITIN, as well as the introduction of a competing OTC loratadine product in December 2002 and additional entrants of generic OTC loratadine products in the market, have had a rapid, sharp and material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and will likely continue for an indeterminate period of time. As disclosed in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and as noted in the “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote included in the financial statements to this report, three drug manufacturers have submitted ANDAs to the FDA seeking to market generic forms of REBETOL (ribavirin) Capsules in the United States before the expiration of the Company’s patents covering ribavirin formulations. The Company has sued those manufacturers in federal court for infringement. During 2003, the Company entered into separate licensing agreements with Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals, L.L.C. (Three Rivers), Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Geneva) and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) that settled all patent litigation between the Company, Three Rivers, Geneva and Teva and granted those three companies each a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to the Company’s U.S. ribavirin patents. These settlements do not affect Three Rivers’, Geneva’s or Teva’s reported patent litigation with Ribapharm, Inc., a subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, (Ribapharm), relating to ribavirin patents. That litigation was dismissed upon defendants’ motion for summary judgment on July 16, 2003. Ribapharm has appealed the summary judgment decision. Ribapharm has also petitioned the FDA to deny approval of the Three Rivers, Geneva and Teva products. The FDA has not acted on the Ribapharm petition. Generic forms of ribavirin are expected to enter the U.S. market in 2004, assuming FDA’s approval of a generic ribavirin. The REBETOL patents are material to the Company’s business. U.S. sales of REBETOL in 2003 were $306 million. PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy for hepatitis C contributed substantially to sales in 2003 and 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2002, a competing pegylated interferon-based combination product, including a brand of ribavirin, received regulatory approval in most major markets, including the United States. The overall market share of the INTRON franchise has declined sharply, reflecting this new market competition. Management believes that the ability of PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy to maintain market share will continue to be adversely affected by new competition in the hepatitis C marketplace. In October 2002, Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals announced that the FDA approved ZETIA (ezetimibe) 10 mg for use either by itself or together with statins for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. In March 2003, the Company announced that ezetimibe (EZETROL, -53- Table of Contents as marketed in Europe) had successfully completed the European Union (EU) mutual recognition procedure (MRP). With the completion of the MRP process, the 15 EU member states as well as Iceland and Norway can grant national marketing authorization with unified labeling for EZETROL. EZETROL has been launched in many international markets. The Merck/Schering-Plough partnership is also pursuing the development and marketing of a once-daily tablet combining ezetimibe with simvastatin (Zocor), Merck’s cholesterol-modifying medicine. Uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect the Company’s operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies and is, therefore, subject to potential administrative actions. Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States. It has jurisdiction over all the Company’s businesses and administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, approval, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of the Company’s products. From time to time, agencies, including the FDA, may require the Company to address various manufacturing, advertising, labeling or other regulatory issues, such as those noted below relating to the Company’s current manufacturing issues. Failure to comply with governmental regulations can result in delays in the release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, discontinuance of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Any such result could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and its results of operations. Additional information regarding government regulation that may affect future results is provided in Part I, Item I, “Business,” in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. Additional information about cautionary factors that may affect future results is provided under the caption “Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results (Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)” in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations and Financial Condition. As noted in the “Consent Decree” footnote included in the financial statements to this report, on May 17, 2002, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with the FDA for a consent decree to resolve issues involving the Company’s compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices at certain manufacturing facilities in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey approved and entered the consent decree on May 20, 2002. Under terms of the consent decree, the Company agreed to pay a total of $500 million to the U.S. government in two equal installments of $250 million; the first installment was paid in May 2002 and the second installment was paid in the second quarter of 2003. As previously reported, the Company accrued a $500 million provision for this consent decree in the fourth quarter of 2001. The consent decree requires the Company to complete a number of actions. In the event certain actions agreed upon in the consent decree are not satisfactorily completed on time, the FDA may assess payments for each deadline missed. The consent decree required the Company to develop -54- Table of Contents and submit for FDA’s concurrence comprehensive cGMP Work Plans for the Company’s manufacturing facilities in New Jersey and Puerto Rico that are covered by the decree. The Company received FDA concurrence with its proposed cGMP Work Plans on May 14, 2003. The cGMP Work Plans contain a number of Significant Steps whose timely and satisfactory completion are subject to payments of $15,000 per business day for each deadline missed. These payments may not exceed $25 million for 2002, and $50 million for each of the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. These payments are subject to an overall cap of $175 million. In connection with its discussions with FDA regarding the Company’s cGMP Work Plans, and pursuant to the terms of the decree, the Company and the FDA entered into a letter agreement dated April 14, 2003. In the letter agreement the Company and the FDA agreed to extend by six months the time period during which the Company may incur payments as described above with respect to certain of the Significant Steps whose proposed due dates are December 31, 2005. The letter agreement does not increase the yearly or overall caps on payments described above. In addition, the decree requires the Company to complete programs of revalidation of the finished drug products and bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured at the covered manufacturing facilities. The Company is required under the consent decree to complete its revalidation programs for bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients by September 30, 2005, and for finished drugs by December 31, 2005. In general, the timely and satisfactory completion of the revalidations are subject to payments of $15,000 per business day for each deadline missed, subject to the caps described above. However, if a product scheduled for revalidation has not been certified as having been validated by the last date on the validation schedule, the FDA may assess a payment of 24.6 percent of the net domestic sales of the uncertified product until the validation is certified. Further, in general, if a product scheduled for revalidation under the consent decree is not certified within six months of its scheduled date, the Company must cease production of that product until certification is obtained. The completion of the Significant Steps in the Work Plans and the completion of the revalidation programs are subject to third-party expert certification, which must be accepted by the FDA. The consent decree provides that if the Company believes that it may not be able to meet a deadline, the Company has the right, upon the showing of good cause, to request extensions of deadlines in connection with the cGMP Work Plans and revalidation programs. However, there is no guarantee that FDA will grant any such requests. Although the Company believes it has made significant progress in meeting its obligations under the consent decree, it is possible that (1) the Company may fail to complete a Significant Step or a revalidation by the prescribed deadline; (2) the third party expert may not certify the completion of the Significant Step or revalidation; or (3) the FDA may disagree with an expert’s certification of a Significant Step or revalidation. In such a case, it is possible that the FDA may assess payments as described above. The Company would expense any payments assessed under the decree if and when incurred. -55- Table of Contents In addition, the failure to meet the terms of the consent decree could result in delays in approval of new products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. In April 2003, the Company received notice of a False Claims Act complaint brought by an individual purporting to act on behalf of the U.S. government against it and approximately 25 other pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that the pharmaceutical companies, including the Company, have defrauded the United States by having made sales to various federal governmental agencies of drugs that were allegedly manufactured in a manner that did not comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices. The Company and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action on July 23, 2003. The Company is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union (EU) and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug in order to alert the manufacturer of the drug and the governmental agency to potential problems. During pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), serious deficiencies in reporting processes were identified. The Company is taking urgent actions to rectify these deficiencies as quickly as possible. The Company does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to these findings. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against the Company and/or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for the Company’s products. As described more specifically in the “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote included in the financial statements to this report, to which the reader of this report is directed, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of the Company and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorney’s Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state “anti-kickback” statutes and statutory and common law “false claims” laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject the Company to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, and the Company also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or -56- Table of Contents sales. Any such result could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition or its results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following accounting policies are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the Company’s financial statements: - Accrual of rebates on sales of pharmaceuticals in the United States; - Provision for income taxes for undistributed foreign earnings and intercompany pricing matters; - Impairment of intangible assets; and - Accounting for legal and regulatory matters. Pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers (e.g., wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations), and the Company invoices those entities when the products are shipped. In addition, the Company has commercial rebate and discount arrangements with certain indirect purchasers and other market participants (e.g., managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers) based upon the purchase or utilization of Company products. The Company also has governmental rebate obligations under certain federal and state programs. For purposes of revenue recognition, the Company at the end of each quarter estimates the applicable commercial and governmental rebates that will be paid for products sold during the quarter and nets those estimated amounts from the total direct sales. These rebates are estimated based on terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, the Company’s payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy the Company’s obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in the “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. As of December 31, 2003, taxes have not been provided on approximately $11.1 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Management has determined that the assets associated with these earnings have been permanently reinvested in the Company’s overseas operations. If future events require that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, additional tax provisions may be necessary. Also with regard to income taxes, certain of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries manufacture pharmaceutical ingredients at facilities located in low-tax jurisdictions. These manufacturing subsidiaries sell the pharmaceutical ingredients to other consolidated subsidiaries for further manufacturing and final sale to customers. Taxing authorities throughout the world -57- Table of Contents can challenge the prices charged by the manufacturing subsidiaries. Management believes its pricing is based upon sound economic facts and circumstances. However, a successful challenge by a taxing authority, which management believes is unlikely, could result in additional income tax payments materially in excess of amounts accrued. Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $619 million at December 31, 2003. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. As discussed in the “Special Charges” section, the Company recognized asset impairment losses in 2003 for intangible assets. Asset impairment losses were recognized for an intangible asset related to a cancer therapy drug due to scientific advancements and for an intangible asset relating to the trade name of a sun care product due to marketplace competition. Management judgments and estimates are also required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters. In particular, the Company has recognized estimated minimum liabilities in connection with certain of the government investigations into its sales and marketing activities. See “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company has subsidiaries in more than 40 countries. In 2003, sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 57 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, the Company’s reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. In 2003, changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 5 percent and increased 2003 diluted earnings per common share by $0.05. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula-based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of foreign operations using derivative financial instruments. Because the Company’s foreign subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover provides a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that the Company’s foreign operations are widespread. -58- Table of Contents In addition, at any point in time, the Company’s foreign subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short-term, third-party and intercompany receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect these financial assets and liabilities. For the most part, however, gains or losses arise from translation and, as such, do not significantly affect net income. On occasion, the Company has used derivatives to hedge specific short-term risk situations involving foreign currency exposures. However, these derivative transactions have not been material. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk The only financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and/or equity prices are the debt and equity securities held in non-qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled $177 million at December 31, 2003. Due to the long-term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, the Company’s exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. The only financial obligations exposed to variability in interest expense are short-term borrowings. The Company maintains a cash and cash equivalent portfolio well in excess of the amount of short-term borrowings. Accordingly, the Company has no net exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its financial obligations. The Company has long-term debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of the debt by $130 million. However, the Company does not expect to refund this debt. Interest Rate Swaps In 1991 and 1992, the Company utilized interest rate swaps as part of its international cash management strategy. For additional information, see the “Financial Instruments and Commitments” footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These swaps subject the Company to a moderate degree of market risk. The Company accounts for these swaps using fair value accounting, with changes in the fair value recorded in earnings. The fair value of these swaps was a liability of $1 million at December 31, 2003, and a liability of $1 million at December 31, 2002. It is estimated that a 10 percent change in interest rate structure could change the fair value of the swaps by less than $1 million. -59- Table of Contents CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS (Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. They use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “will,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of potential future events, circumstances or future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to future actions, ability to access the capital markets, prospective products, the status of product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, development programs, expenses and programs to reduce expenses, the cost of and savings from the VERP, the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations, growth strategy and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements here or in other publications may turn out to be wrong. Actual results may vary materially, and there are no guarantees about the performance of Schering-Plough stock. Schering-Plough does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Many factors could cause actual results to differ from Schering-Plough’s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the following: • A significant portion of net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the United States. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. • Competitive factors, including technological advances attained by competitors, patents granted to competitors, new products of competitors coming to the market, new indications for competitive products or generic prescription or OTC competition as Schering-Plough’s products mature and patents expire on products. • Increased pricing pressure both in the United States and abroad from managed care organizations, institutions and government agencies and programs. In the United States, among other developments, consolidation among customers may increase pricing pressures and may result in various customers having greater influence over prescription decisions through formulary decisions and other policies. • Government laws and regulations (and changes in laws and regulations) affecting domestic and international operations including health care reform initiatives and drug importation legislation in the United States at the state and federal level and in other -60- Table of Contents countries, as well as laws and regulations relating to trade, antitrust, monetary and fiscal policies, taxes, price controls and possible nationalization. • Patent positions can be highly uncertain and patent disputes are not unusual. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively impact sales of existing products or result in injunctive relief and payment of financial remedies. • Uncertainties of the FDA approval process and the regulatory approval and review processes in other countries, including, without limitation, delays in approval of new products. • Failure to meet Good Manufacturing Practices established by the FDA and other governmental authorities can result in delays in the approval of products, release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. The resolution of manufacturing issues with the FDA discussed in Schering-Plough’s 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties, including the timing, scope and duration of a resolution of the manufacturing issues, will depend on the ability of Schering-Plough to assure the FDA of the quality and reliability of its manufacturing systems and controls, and the extent of remedial and prospective obligations undertaken by Schering-Plough. • Difficulties in product development. Pharmaceutical product development is highly uncertain. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach market for numerous reasons. They may be found to be ineffective or to have harmful side effects in clinical or pre-clinical testing, they may fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, they may turn out not to be economically feasible because of manufacturing costs or other factors or they may be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others. • Efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to recalls, withdrawals or declining sales. • Major products such as CLARITIN, CLARINEX, INTRON A, PEG-INTRON, REBETOL Capsules, REMICADE and NASONEX accounted for a material portion of Schering-Plough’s 2003 revenues. If any major product were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection, OTC availability of the Company’s product or a competitive product (as has been disclosed for CLARITIN and its current and potential OTC competition), previously unknown side effects; if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced; generic availability of competitive products; or if the product is discontinued for any reason, the impact on revenues could be significant. Further, such information about important new products, such as ZETIA, or important products in our pipeline, may impact future revenues. • Unfavorable outcomes of government (local and federal, domestic and international) investigations, litigation about product pricing, product liability claims, other litigation and environmental concerns could preclude commercialization of products, negatively affect the profitability of existing products, materially and adversely impact Schering-Plough’s financial condition and results of operations, or contain conditions that impact business operations, such as exclusion from government reimbursement programs. • Economic factors over which Schering-Plough has no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. -61- Table of Contents • Instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region - due to the location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or customers - regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or diseases. • Changes in tax laws including changes related to taxation of foreign earnings. • Changes in accounting standards promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that would require a significant change to Schering-Plough’s accounting practices. For further details and a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, see Schering-Plough’s past and future SEC filings. Item 7A.

310158,MRK,"Merck & Co., Inc.",2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of the Company: Schering-Plough (the Company) discovers, develops, manufactures and markets medical therapies and treatments to enhance human health. The Company also markets leading consumer brands in the over-the-counter (OTC), foot care and sun care markets and operates a global animal health business. As a research-based pharmaceutical company, Schering-Plough’s core strategy is to invest substantial amounts of funds in scientific research with the goal of creating important medical and commercial value. Research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases. There is a high rate of failure inherent in such research and, as a result, there is a high risk that the funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to the commercial phase may take a decade or more. Because of the high-risk nature of research investments, financial resources typically must come from internal sources (operations and cash reserves) or from equity-type capital. There are two sources of new products: products acquired through acquisition and licensing arrangements, and products in the Company’s late-stage research pipeline. With respect to acquisitions and licensing, there are limited opportunities for obtaining or licensing critical late-stage products, and these limited opportunities typically require substantial amounts of funding. The Company competes for these opportunities against companies often with far greater financial resources than that of the Company. Due to the present financial situation, it may be challenging for the Company to acquire or license critical late-stage products that will have a positive material financial impact. During the past three years, the Company experienced a number of negative events that have strained and continue to strain the Company’s financial resources. These negative events included, but were not limited to, the following matters: • Entered into a formal consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 and agreed to revalidate manufacturing processes at certain manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Significant increased spending associated with manufacturing compliance efforts will continue through the completion of the FDA consent decree obligation. In addition, the Company has found it necessary to discontinue certain older profitable products and outsource other products. • Switch of CLARITIN in the U.S., beginning in December 2002 from prescription to OTC status. This switch coupled with private label competition has resulted in a much lower average unit selling price for this product and ongoing intense competition. The Company’s exposure to powerful retail purchasers has also increased. • Market shares and sales levels of certain other Company products have fallen significantly and have experienced increased competition. Many of these products compete in declining or volatile markets. • Investigations into certain of the Company’s sales and marketing practices by the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. During 2004 the Company made payments totaling $294 million to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in settlement of that investigation. The Massachusetts investigation is continuing and poses significant financial and commercial risks to the Company. In response to these matters, beginning in April 2003 the Company appointed a new management team that formulated, and has begun to implement, a six- to eight-year Action Agenda to stabilize, repair and then turn around the Company. The Company intends to avail itself of the foreign earnings repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Under this Act the Company intends to repatriate $9.4 billion of unremitted foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate. This repatriation of funds will provide the Company with greater financial stability. 22 Table of Contents Current State of the Business: For the past two years the Company’s earnings and cash flow have declined significantly. The overriding cause of this is the loss of marketing exclusivity for two of the Company’s major pharmaceutical products, CLARITIN and REBETOL as well as increased competition in the hepatitis C market. Sales and marketing costs have increased due to the need to reinvest in these functions to launch new products as well as a need to stabilize market shares of the Company’s remaining pharmaceutical products. Many of the Company’s manufacturing sites operate well below optimum production levels due to sales declines and the reduction in output related to the FDA consent decree. At the same time, overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased due to the consent decree and other compliance activities. The Company continues to review the carrying value of these assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related costs. The Company continues to pursue its core strategy of supporting its marketed and new products in its research and development pipeline and plans to invest in sales and marketing and scientific research at historical levels. However, this level of investment is not sustainable without a significant increase in profits and cash flow from operations. The ability of the Company to generate profits and significant operating cash flow is directly and predominantly dependent upon the increasing profitability of the Company’s cholesterol franchise (which includes VYTORIN and ZETIA) and to a much lesser extent growing sales and profitability of the base pharmaceutical business products, developing or acquiring new products and controlling expenses. If the Company cannot generate significant operating cash flow, its ability to invest in sales, marketing and research efforts at historical levels may be negatively impacted. ZETIA is the Company’s novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor, Merck’s statin medication. These two products have been launched through a joint venture between the Company and Merck. The cholesterol-reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical market in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are well positioned in this market, but these products compete against other and well established cholesterol management products marketed by companies with financial resources much greater than that of the Company. The financial commitment to compete in this market is shared with Merck and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. Management cannot provide assurance that profits in the near-term will be sufficient for the Company to maintain its core marketing and research strategies. If a sufficient level of profit and cash flow cannot be achieved, the Company would need to evaluate strategic alternatives. With regard to an examination of strategic alternatives, the contracts with Merck for VYTORIN and ZETIA and the contract with Centocor, Inc. for REMICADE (exhibits 10 (r) and 10 (u), respectively, to the Company’s 2003 Form 10-K) contain provisions related to a change of control, as defined in those contracts. These provisions could result in the aforementioned products being acquired by Merck or reverting back to Centocor, Inc. Regulatory Environment in which the Company Operates: Government regulatory agencies throughout the world regulate the Company’s discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing efforts. The FDA is a central regulator of the Company’s business. Since 2001, the Company has been working with the FDA to resolve issues involving the Company’s compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at certain of its manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. In 2002, the Company reached a formal agreement with the FDA to enter into a consent decree. Under the terms of the consent decree, the Company made payments totaling $500 million and agreed to revalidate the manufacturing processes at these sites. These manufacturing sites have remained open throughout this period; however, the consent decree has placed significant additional controls on production and release of products from these sites, including review and third-party certification of production activities. The third-party certifications and other cGMP improvement projects have resulted in higher costs as well as reduced output at these facilities. In addition, the Company has found it necessary to discontinue certain profitable older products. The Company’s research and development operations have also been negatively impacted by the decree because these operations share common facilities with the manufacturing operations. 23 Table of Contents In the U.S., the pricing of the Company’s pharmaceutical products are subject to competitive pressure as managed care organizations seek price discounts. Also in the U.S., the Company is required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans’ health care program and other government-funded programs. In most international markets, the Company operates in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs. Recently, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. The Company continues to maintain a robust process for monitoring adverse events related to its products around the world. Company personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. On July 30, 2004, Schering-Plough Corporation, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced a settlement related to certain of the Company’s sales and marketing practices that had been under investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, a subsidiary of Schering-Plough Corporation pled guilty to a single federal criminal charge concerning a payment to a managed care customer. In addition, under the settlement, Schering-Plough Corporation also entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (CIA). Failure to comply with the CIA can result in financial penalties. The settlement will not affect the ability of Schering-Plough Corporation to participate in federal healthcare programs. DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales: Consolidated net sales in 2004 totaled $8.3 billion, a decrease of $62 million or 1 percent compared with 2003. Consolidated net sales reflected primarily volume declines offset by a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 4 percent. Consolidated 2003 net sales of $8.3 billion decreased $1.8 billion or 18 percent versus 2002, reflecting primarily volume declines offset by a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 5 percent. 24 Table of Contents Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 (Dollars in millions) Prescription Pharmaceuticals $ 6,417 $ 6,611 $ 8,745 (3 )% (24 )% Remicade 746 540 337 38 60 Clarinex/ Aerius 692 694 598 0 16 Nasonex 594 500 523 19 (4 ) PEG-Intron 563 802 1,015 (30 ) (21 ) Temodar 459 324 278 42 16 Integrilin 325 306 304 6 1 Claritin Rx(a) 321 328 1,802 (2 ) (82 ) Intron A 318 409 533 (22 ) (23 ) Rebetol 287 639 1,222 (55 ) (48 ) Subutex 185 144 103 29 40 Elocon 168 154 165 9 (7 ) Caelyx 150 111 71 35 55 Other Pharmaceutical 1,609 1,660 1,794 (3 ) (7 ) Consumer Health Care 1,085 1,026 758 6 35 OTC(b) 578 588 275 (2 ) N/M Foot Care 331 292 290 13 1 Sun Care 176 146 193 20 (24 ) Animal Health 770 697 677 10 3 Consolidated net sales $ 8,272 $ 8,334 $ 10,180 (1 )% (18 )% Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. N/ M — Not a meaningful percentage. (a) Amounts shown for 2004 and 2003 include international sales of CLARITIN Rx only. (b) Includes OTC CLARITIN of $419, $432 and $105 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. International net sales of REMICADE, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis, were up $206 million or 38 percent in 2004 to $746 million due to greater medical use and expanded indications in European markets. Sales of REMICADE in 2003 were $540 million, up $203 million or 60 percent compared with 2002, primarily in Europe, due to increased patient utilization. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.) for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year-round indoor allergies were $692 million for 2004, essentially flat versus 2003. Sales outside the U.S. increased 39 percent to $272 million in 2004 due to market share gains and continued conversion from prescription CLARITIN. U.S. sales decreased 16 percent to $420 million in 2004 due to the continued contraction in the U.S. prescription antihistamine market following the launch of OTC CLARITIN and other branded and non-branded nonsedating antihistamines coupled with market share declines. Global net sales of CLARINEX were $694 million in 2003, an increase of 16 percent compared to $598 million in 2002, reflecting the continued conversion of patients from prescription CLARITIN, coupled with the launch of CLARINEX in several international markets. Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once-daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 19 percent to $594 million in 2004 primarily due to international sales growth and favorable prior year trade inventory comparisons in the U.S., tempered by a decline in U.S. market share. 2003 sales of NASONEX decreased 4 percent versus 2002 to $500 million due to changes in U.S. trade inventory levels and market share declines in the U.S. 25 Table of Contents Global net sales of PEG-INTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, decreased 30 percent to $563 million compared with 2003 due to ongoing market competition in a contracting market. Market share of PEG-INTRON has been declining, reflecting the entrance of a competitor’s new products in the hepatitis C market in 2003. Sales of PEG-INTRON decreased $213 million or 21 percent to $802 million in 2003 compared to 2002, due primarily to loss of market share. Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, decreased 22 percent in 2004 to $318 million due primarily to lower demand. Sales of INTRON A were $409 million in 2003, a decline of 23 percent from 2002 due primarily to loss of market share. Global net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with INTRON A or PEG-INTRON for treating hepatitis C, decreased 55 percent to $287 million due to the launch of generic versions of REBETOL in the U.S. in April 2004 and increased price competition outside the U.S. Sales of REBETOL were $639 million in 2003, a decline of 48 percent from $1.2 billion in 2002, due primarily to loss of market share resulting from new branded competition. Global net sales of TEMODAR Capsules, for treating certain types of brain tumors, increased $135 million or 42 percent to $459 million in 2004 due to increased market penetration. Sales of TEMODAR were $324 million in 2003, an increase of 16 percent compared to $278 million in 2002, due to increased market penetration. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold by Schering-Plough, primarily in the U.S., increased $19 million or 6 percent to $325 million in 2004 due to increased patient utilization. Sales of INTEGRILIN were $306 million and $304 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Millennium”) and the Company have a co-promotion agreement for INTEGRILIN. Millennium notified the Company that it intends to exercise its right under the agreement to assume responsibilities for consumer service, managed care contracting, government reporting and physical distribution of INTEGRILIN. As a result, based on the final assumption agreement, as early as the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company may be required to cease the recording of sales of INTEGRILIN and record its share of co-promotion profits as alliance revenue. Currently, the Company anticipates that this change in recording sales of INTEGRILIN would have no impact on earnings. International net sales of prescription CLARITIN decreased 2 percent from $328 million in 2003 to $321 million in 2004 due to continued conversion to CLARINEX. In 2002, global sales of prescription CLARITIN were $1.8 billion, reflecting over $1.4 billion of sales in the U.S. prior to its conversion to OTC status. International net sales of SUBUTEX Tablets, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 29 percent to $185 million due to increased market penetration. Sales of SUBUTEX were $144 million in 2003 and $103 million in 2002. SUBUTEX may be vulnerable to generic competition in the future. Global net sales of ELOCON cream, a medium-potency topical steroid, increased 9 percent to $168 million. Sales of ELOCON were $154 million in 2003 and $165 million in 2002. Generic competition is expected to affect sales of this product. International sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma, increased 35 percent to $150 million reflecting further adoption of the metastatic breast cancer indication in patients who are at increased cardiac risk. Sales of CAELYX in 2003 increased 55 percent versus 2002 to $111 million, due to increased patient utilization coupled with the launch of the metastatic breast cancer indication. Other pharmaceutical net sales include a large number of lower sales volume prescription pharmaceutical products. Several of these products are sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. The products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. 26 Table of Contents Global net sales of consumer health care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased $59 million or 6 percent in 2004 to $1.1 billion. Net sales of foot care products increased $39 million or 13 percent in 2004 due primarily to the strong performance of DR. SCHOLL’S FREEZE AWAY, a new wart remover product. Net sales of sun care products increased $30 million or 20 percent in 2004, primarily due to the timing of orders and shipments. Sales of OTC CLARITIN were $419 million in 2004, a decrease of $13 million or 3 percent from 2003, due to competition from branded and private label loratadine. Net sales of consumer health care products in 2003 increased $268 million or 35 percent compared to 2002, due primarily to increased sales of OTC CLARITIN following its launch in December 2002. Global net sales of animal health products increased 10 percent in 2004 to $770 million. Sales were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of 6 percent. Global net sales of animal health products increased 3 percent in 2003, which were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of 7 percent. Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 (Dollars in millions) Cost of sales $ 3,070 $ 2,833 $ 2,505 8 % 13 % % of net sales 37.1 % 34.0 % 24.6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,811 $ 3,474 $ 3,681 10 % (6 %) % of net sales 46.1 % 41.7 % 36.2 % Research and development $ 1,607 $ 1,469 $ 1,425 9 % 3 % % of net sales 19.4 % 17.6 % 14.0 % Other expense (income), net $ 146 $ 59 $ (144 ) N/M N/M % of net sales 1.8 % 0.7 % (1.4 %) Special charges $ 153 $ 599 $ 150 N/M N/M % of net sales 1.8 % 7.2 % 1.5 % Equity income from cholesterol joint venture $ (347 ) $ (54 ) $ — N/M N/M N/ M — Not a meaningful percentage. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2004 increased over 2003, primarily due to lower production volumes coupled with increased spending related to the FDA consent decree, other manufacturing compliance spending, and efforts to upgrade the Company’s global infrastructure. The absence of European LOSEC revenues and a change in product sales mix, including sales of Bayer licensed products, contributed to the unfavorable comparison as well. The Company’s base pharmaceutical business is competing in many declining or volatile markets. Sales and the cost of sales of base business products have a direct impact on gross margin. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2003 increased over 2002 due to a change in product sales mix resulting from the loss of U.S. sales of prescription CLARITIN, as well as lower production volumes and increased spending for the Company’s cGMP compliance efforts. Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in the Company’s net sales. The results of the operations of the joint venture are reflected in equity income and have no impact on the Company’s gross and other operating margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 10 percent to $3.8 billion in 2004 versus $3.5 billion in 2003 primarily due to the expansion of the sales field force, higher employee related costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by lower promotional spending. The ratio of SG&A to net sales of 46.1 percent in 2004 was higher than the ratio of 41.7 percent in 2003. SG&A expenses 27 Table of Contents decreased 6 percent to $3.5 billion in 2003 from $3.7 billion in 2002 due to lower pharmaceutical business marketing spending and lower employee related costs. The ratio of SG&A to net sales of 41.7 percent in 2003 was higher than the ratio of 36.2 percent in 2002, primarily due to lower overall sales reported in 2003. Research and development (R&D) spending increased 9 percent to $1.6 billion, representing 19.4 percent of net sales in 2004, and includes an $80 million charge in conjunction with the license from Toyama Chemical Company Ltd. (Toyama) for garenoxacin, a quinolone antibiotic currently in development. Generally, changes in R&D spending reflect the timing of the Company’s funding of both internal research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. In 2004 and 2003, the increase in Other expense (income), net, is primarily the result of higher net interest expense. Other expense (income), net in 2002 included $80 million of income related to the sale of the Company’s U.S. marketing rights for SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX sublingual tablets for the treatment of opioid dependence. Special Charges: The components of Special Charges are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Litigation charges $ — $ 350 $ 150 Employee termination costs 119 179 — Asset impairment and related charges 34 70 — $ 153 $ 599 $ 150 Litigation Charges In 2003 and 2002, litigation reserves were increased by $350 million and $150 million, respectively, primarily as a result of the investigations into the Company’s sales and marketing practices. Employee Termination Costs In August 2003, the Company announced a global workforce reduction initiative. The first phase of this initiative was a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the U.S. Under this program, eligible employees in the U.S. had until December 15, 2003 to elect early retirement and receive an enhanced retirement benefit. Approximately 900 employees elected to retire under the program, of which approximately 850 employees retired through year-end 2004 and approximately 50 employees have staggered retirement dates in 2005. The total cost of this program is approximately $191 million, comprised of increased pension costs of $108 million, increased post-retirement health care costs of $57 million, vacation payments of $4 million and costs related to accelerated vesting of stock grants of $22 million. For employees with staggered retirement dates in 2005, these amounts will be recognized as a charge over the employees’ remaining service periods. Amounts recognized in 2004 and 2003 for this program were $20 million and $164 million, respectively. The amount expected to be recognized in 2005 is $7 million. Termination costs not associated with the VERP totaled $99 million and $15 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Asset Impairment and Related Charges The Company recorded asset impairment and related charges of $34 million and $70 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The charge in 2004 relates primarily to the shutdown of a small European research-and-development facility. 28 Table of Contents The asset impairment and related charges in 2003 were related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom, the write-down of production equipment related to products that are no longer produced at a manufacturing site operating under the FDA consent decree, the write-down of a drug license and a sun care trade name for which expected cash flows did not support the carrying value. Summary of Selected Special Charges The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to employee termination costs and asset impairment and related charges: Employee Asset Impairment Termination and Related Costs Charges (Dollars in millions) Special charges incurred during 2003 $ 179 $ 70 Impairment write-downs — (70 ) Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (144 ) — Disbursements (6 ) — Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2003 $ 29 $ — Special charges incurred during 2004 $ 119 $ 34 Impairment write-downs — (27 ) Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (20 ) — Disbursements (110 ) (7 ) Special charges liability balance December 31, 2004 $ 18 $ — Equity Income from Cholesterol Joint Venture Global cholesterol franchise sales, which include sales made by the Company and the cholesterol joint venture with Merck of VYTORIN and ZETIA, totaled $1.2 billion and $471 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. VYTORIN has been approved in 25 countries and has been launched in several countries, including the U.S. in July 2004. ZETIA has been approved in 72 countries and was launched in the U.S. and over 40 international markets since November 2002. The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting for the joint venture. Sharing of net income is based upon percentages that vary by product, sales level and country. Schering-Plough’s allocation of joint venture income is increased by milestones earned. The partners bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the joint venture reimburses each partner for a pre-defined amount of physician details that are set on an annual basis. Schering-Plough reports the receipt of this reimbursement as part of equity income as under U.S. GAAP this amount does not represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs for the Company’s detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, this reimbursement amount per physician detail is not reflective of Schering-Plough’s joint venture sales force effort as Schering-Plough’s sales force-related infrastructure costs per physician detail are generally estimated to be higher. Costs of the joint venture that the partners contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct-to consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out-of-pocket promotion) and other agreed-upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by the partners. Equity income from cholesterol joint venture, as defined, totaled $347 million and $54 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. 29 Table of Contents During 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized milestones from Merck of $7 million and $20 million, respectively, relating to the approval of ezetimibe/simvastatin in Mexico in 2004 and certain European approvals of ZETIA in 2003. These amounts are included in equity income. Under certain other conditions, as specified in the Merck agreements, Merck could pay additional milestones to the Company totaling $125 million. It should be noted that the Company incurs substantial costs such as selling costs that are not reflected in Equity income from cholesterol joint venture and are borne entirely by the Company. Prior to 2003, the venture was in the research and development phase and the Company’s share of research and development expense in 2002 was $69 million and was reported in Research and Development in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. In 2003 and 2004 Research and development costs related to the joint venture are included in equity income. Provision for Income Taxes Tax expense was $779 million, $46 million and $589 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The tax provision in 2004 includes a charge of approximately $417 million (tax charge of $494 million less $77 million in foreign tax credits) related to the intended repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), $174 million in foreign and state taxes and a valuation allowance of approximately $240 million provided against certain deferred tax assets resulting from changes in Company tax planning strategies triggered by the opportunity to take full advantage of the Act. See discussion of the overall impacts of the Act on the Company below. The 2004 tax provision also includes a U.S. Net Operating Loss (U.S. NOL) carryback benefit of approximately $52 million. Net (loss)/ income: Net loss was $947 million in 2004 versus a loss of $92 million in 2003 and net income of $2.0 billion in 2002. Net loss in 2004 includes tax expense of $779 million primarily for the intended repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and a valuation reserve for net deferred tax assets in the U.S. The net loss in 2004 also reflects higher Selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the build-up of the U.S. sales force for the VYTORIN launch and the addition of sales representatives as a result of the Bayer licensing agreement as well as pre-tax special charges of $153 million, as described above. The 2004 results also include a pre-tax research and development charge of $80 million for the license of garenoxacin from Toyama Chemical Company Ltd. Net loss in 2003 includes special charges of $599 million, as described above. Net income in 2002 includes special charges of $150 million to increase litigation reserves. Net loss available to common shareholders: The 2004 net loss available to common shareholders includes the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $34 million related to the issuance of the mandatory convertible preferred stock in August 2004. Impact of the American Jobs Creation Act The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was enacted into law in October 2004. One provision of the Act effectively reduces the tax rate on qualifying repatriation of funds held by foreign-based subsidiaries to 5.25 percent. Normally such repatriations would be taxed at a rate of up to 35 percent. To qualify for the reduced tax rate the funds must be repatriated during a one-year period and fund qualifying expenditures in the U.S. The amount of funds that can be repatriated at the reduced tax rate is limited to the amount of unremitted foreign earnings reported in the Company’s 2002 Annual Report. 30 Table of Contents During 2005, the Company intends to repatriate approximately $9.4 billion under the Act, which is the maximum amount of funds qualifying for the reduced tax rate. This repatriation of funds will trigger a U.S. income tax payment in 2005 of approximately $417 million, net of available tax credits. For financial reporting purposes, this tax payment has been recognized as an expense in 2004. Repatriating funds under the Act will benefit the Company in the following ways: • As discussed in more detail in the Liquidity and Financial Resources section, the Company’s U.S. operations incur significant negative cash flow. It is expected that the repatriations to be made during 2005 under the Act will provide the Company with greater financial stability and the ability to fund the U.S. cash needs for the intermediate term. • As disclosed in prior 10-K and 10-Q filings, the Company had intended to fund future U.S. cash flow deficits by repatriating funds in amounts up to its U.S. NOL’s. This strategy would have minimized taxes on such repatriations of funds, but would have also utilized some or all of the U.S. NOL’s and the potential benefit of being able to carry forward these U.S. NOL’s to reduce U.S. taxable income in the future. Under the Act, qualifying repatriations do not reduce U.S. tax losses. As a result of the Act, the Company will have both the cash necessary to fund its U.S. cash needs as well as maintaining the potential benefit of being able to carry forward U.S. NOL’s to reduce U.S. taxable income in the future. This potential future benefit could be significant and is dependent on the Company achieving profitability in the U.S. Under U.S. GAAP companies must review and provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that may not have future benefit. The Company has generally established a valuation reserve against net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2004 due to changes in tax planning strategies triggered by the opportunity to take full advantage of the Act. At December 31, 2004 the Company has approximately $1 billion of U.S. NOL’s for tax purposes available to offset future U.S. taxable income through 2024. The Company has in general recorded a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in the U.S. The Company expects additional U.S. NOL’s to be generated in 2005. If Congress does not legislate certain technical corrections related to the Act in 2005, the Company’s U.S. NOL’s could be reduced by approximately $675 million. As stated above the Company intends to repatriate approximately $9.4 billion during 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s foreign-based subsidiaries held cash and short-term investments totaling approximately $5.8 billion. This amount excludes $1.9 billion in cash that the foreign-based subsidiaries will receive from a counterparty upon termination of an interest rate swap arrangement that the Company will terminate in 2005. Additionally, the foreign-based subsidiaries are expected to generate substantial cash flow during 2005 which will be available to fund the planned repatriation. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow In 2004, operating activities used $154 million of cash. This amount includes the receipt of $404 million for a U.S. tax refund related to the carryback of 2003 U.S. NOL’s and the payment of $473 million to the U.S. government for a tax deficiency relating to certain transactions entered into in 1991 and 1992, and the payment of $294 million under the settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In 2003, operating activities provided approximately $601 million of cash. This amount includes the cash flow benefit from the reduction in accounts receivable following the end of sales of CLARITIN as a prescription product in the U.S. This amount also includes a $250 million payment relating to the FDA consent decree. In both 2004 and 2003, operating activities on a worldwide basis generated insufficient cash to fund capital expenditures and dividends. This cash flow deficit is particularly pronounced when disaggregated on a geographic basis. Foreign operations generate cash in excess of local cash needs. However, U.S. operations 31 Table of Contents have cash needs well in excess of cash generated in the U.S. The U.S. operations must fund dividend payments, the vast majority of research and development costs and U.S. capital expenditures. In years prior to 2003, overall U.S. cash needs were funded primarily through operations. Following the loss of marketing exclusivity of CLARITIN in December 2002, U.S. profits and cash generation declined materially. Cash requirements during 2004 in the U.S. including operating cash needs, capital expenditures, litigation and tax charges, and dividends on common and preferred shares approximated $2.2 billion. The Company borrowed funds and issued equity securities during 2004 as discussed below to finance U.S. operations, and continued to accumulate cash in its foreign-based subsidiaries. In 2005, management expects that dividends and capital expenditures on a worldwide basis will again exceed cash generated from operating activities and that U.S. operations will continue to generate negative cash flow. Payments regarding litigation and investigations could increase cash needs. Management expects to fund the overall 2005 U.S. cash flow deficit by using cash and investments currently held by its foreign subsidiaries. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, discussed above, will provide the Company with greater financial stability and the ability to fund U.S. cash needs for the intermediate term. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments less total debt was approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company anticipates this amount to decline in 2005, but remain positive. In August 2004 the Company issued 6% mandatory convertible preferred stock (see Note 10 “Shareholders Equity” to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and received net proceeds of $1.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. The proceeds were used to reduce short-term commercial paper borrowings, to pay settlement amounts and litigation costs, and fund operating expenses, shareholder dividends and capital expenditures. The preferred stock was issued under the Company’s $2.0 billion shelf registration. As of December 31, 2004, $563 million remains registered and unissued under the shelf registration. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On November 26, 2003, the Company issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2033. Proceeds from this offering of $2.4 billion were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying commercial paper outstanding in the U.S. Upon issuance, the notes were rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and A+ (on Credit Watch with negative implications) by Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moody’s or S&P is downgraded below A3 or A-, respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 8 “Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Other Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On July 14, 2004, Moody’s lowered its rating on the notes to Baa1. Accordingly, the interest payable on each note increased 25 basis points effective December 1, 2004. Therefore, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3% to 5.55%, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5% to 6.75%. This adjustment to the interest rate payable on the notes will increase the Company’s interest expense by approximately $6 million annually. The Company has two revolving credit facilities totaling $1.5 billion. Both facilities are from a syndicate of major financial institutions. The most recently negotiated facility (May 2004) is a $1.25 billion, five-year credit facility. This facility matures in May 2009 and requires the Company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent. The second credit facility provides a $250 million line of credit through its maturity date in May 2006 and requires the Company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent any time the Company is rated at or below Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by S&P. These facilities are available for general corporate purposes and are considered as support for the Company’s commercial paper borrowings. These facilities do not require compensating balances; however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. At December 31, 2004, no funds were drawn under either of these facilities. 32 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004, short-term borrowings totaled $1.6 billion. Approximately 93 percent of this was outstanding commercial paper. The commercial paper ratings discussed below have not significantly affected the Company’s ability to issue or rollover its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, the Company believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as the Company, with one or more short-term credit ratings of P-2 from Moody’s, A-2 from S&P and/or F2 from Fitch Ratings (Fitch) to issue or rollover outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short-term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to such issuers is typically less than that of higher-rated companies. The Company maintains sizable lines of credit with commercial banks, as well as cash and short-term investments held by foreign-based subsidiaries, to serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. Credit Ratings On February 18, 2004, S&P downgraded the Company’s senior unsecured debt ratings to A- from A. At the same time, S&P also lowered the Company’s short-term corporate credit and commercial paper rating to A-2 from A-1. The Company’s S&P rating outlook remains negative. On May 11, 2004, the shelf registration, as amended, that allowed the Company to issue up to $2 billion in various debt and equity securities was declared effective by the SEC. On March 3, 2004, S&P assigned the shelf registration a preliminary rating of A- for senior unsecured debt and a preliminary subordinated debt rating of BBB+. As of September 30, 2004, $563 million remains registered and unissued under the shelf registration. On April 29, 2004, Moody’s placed the Company’s senior unsecured credit rating of A3 on its Watchlist for possible downgrade based upon concerns related to market share declines, litigation risks and a high degree of reliance on the success of VYTORIN. On July 14, 2004, Moody’s lowered the Company’s senior unsecured credit rating from A3 to Baa1, lowered the Company’s senior unsecured shelf registration rating from (P)A3 to (P)Baa1, lowered the Company’s subordinated shelf registration rating from (P)Baa1 to (P)Baa2, lowered the Company’s cumulative and non-cumulative preferred stock shelf registration rating from (P)Baa2 to (P)Baa3, confirmed the Company’s P-2 commercial paper rating and removed the Company from the Watchlist. Moody’s rating outlook for the Company is negative. See the Borrowings and Credit Facilities section above for a discussion of the impact of Moody’s rating downgrade on the interest rates payable on the Company’s long-term debt. On November 20, 2003, Fitch downgraded the Company’s senior unsecured and bank loan ratings to A- from A+, and its commercial paper rating to F-2 from F-1. The Company’s rating outlook remained negative. In announcing the downgrade, Fitch noted that the sales decline in the Company’s leading product franchise, at that time the INTRON franchise, was greater than anticipated, and that it was concerned that total Company growth is reliant on the performance of two key growth drivers, ZETIA and REMICADE, in the near term. On August 4, 2004, Fitch affirmed the Company’s A-senior unsecured rating and bank loan rating and the F-2 commercial paper rating, and reiterated the negative outlook. The Company’s credit rating could decline further. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on the Company’s long-term debt. As discussed above, the Company believes that the repatriation of funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 will allow the Company to fund its U.S. cash needs for the intermediate term. Financial Arrangements Containing Credit Rating Downgrade Triggers The Company has an interest rate swap arrangement in effect with a counterparty bank that is subject to credit rating triggers. The arrangement utilizes two long-term interest rate swap contracts, one between a foreign-based subsidiary of the Company and a bank and the other between a U.S. subsidiary of the Company and the same bank. The two contracts have equal and offsetting terms and are covered by a master netting arrangement. The contract involving the foreign-based subsidiary permits the subsidiary to prepay a portion of its future obligation to the bank, and the contract involving the U.S. subsidiary permits the bank to prepay a portion of its future obligation to the U.S. subsidiary. Interest is paid on the prepaid balances by both parties at 33 Table of Contents market rates. Prepayments totaling $1.9 billion have been made under both contracts as of December 31, 2004. The arrangement originally provided that in the event the Company failed to maintain the required minimum credit ratings, the counterparty may terminate the transaction by designating an early termination date not earlier than 36-months following the date of such notice to terminate. Both S&P’s and Moody’s current credit ratings are below the specified minimum. As of the date of this 10-K, the counterparty has not given the Company notice to terminate. On December 1, 2004, the Company and the counterparty mutually agreed to amend the swap contracts. The Company and the counterparty have agreed to a phased termination of the arrangement, including repayment of all prepaid amounts based on an agreed schedule. The scheduled terminations and associated repayment of the prepaid amounts will begin no later than March 30, 2005, and will end no later than January 15, 2009. In addition, under the amended agreement, the 36-month grace period that previously applied in the event the counterparty gives notice of termination as a result of the Company’s failure to maintain the required minimum credit ratings has been extended to January 15, 2009. In the event that the counterparty gives the Company a termination notice under this provision, all scheduled terminations and associated payments will continue according to the agreed repayment schedule during the time between delivery of the termination notice and January 15, 2009. The provisions in the original arrangement, which also allowed the counterparty to give a 12-month notice to terminate the transaction if, on the 10th anniversary of the transaction (November 17, 2007), the Company’s credit ratings were not at least A2 by Moody’s and A by S&P, have been eliminated. In their place, the Company has accepted a new credit trigger which provides that the counterparty may terminate the transaction should the Company fail to maintain a long-term, U.S. dollar denominated, senior unsecured indebtedness rating of at least BBB by S&P or Baa2 by Moody’s. Termination under this provision would be on the later of November 16, 2007, or 60 days from the date the Company receives such notice to terminate. Should the Company fail to meet the minimum credit requirement resulting in an early termination under this provision, all scheduled swap terminations and associated payments will continue through the termination date. The Company may, at its option, accelerate the scheduled terminations and associated payments for a nominal fee. On February 28, 2005, the Company’s foreign-based subsidiary and U.S. subsidiary each gave notice to the counterparty to terminate the arrangement. Accordingly, all prepaid amounts will be repaid by the respective obligor. The Company will repay its U.S. obligation with funds repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (see above section entitled “Impact of the American Jobs Creation Act”). 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments due by period under the Company’s known contractual obligations at December 31, 2004, are as follows: Payments Due By Period Less More than than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 2,392 $ — $ — $ — $ 2,392 Operating lease obligations 317 80 115 81 41 Purchase obligations: Advertising contracts 153 146 7 — — Research contracts(2) 134 129 5 — — Capital expenditure commitments 154 151 3 — — Other purchase orders(3) 998 992 6 — — Other recorded long-term liabilities(4) 534 18 20 20 476 Total $ 4,682 $ 1,516 $ 156 $ 101 $ 2,909 (1) Long-term debt obligations include the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2013 and $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2033. See Note 8 “Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Other Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) Research contracts do not include any potential milestone payments to be made since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by the Company without penalty. (3) Other open purchase orders consist of both cancelable and noncancelable inventory and expense items. (4) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of the Company’s pension plans that do not hold qualified assets and estimated payments under the Company’s deferred compensation plans. Environmental Matters The Company has responsibilities for environmental cleanup under various state, local and federal laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Environmental expenditures have not had and, based on information currently available, are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company. See Note 16 “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additional Factors Influencing Operations In the U.S., many of the Company’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In most international markets, the Company operates in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs. In the U.S. market, the Company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans’ health care program and other government-funded programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods to control costs. Since the Company is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. 35 Table of Contents Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company cannot predict what net effect the Medicare prescription drug benefit will have on markets and sales. The new Medicare Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D), which will take effect January 1, 2006, will offer voluntary prescription drug coverage, subsidized by Medicare, to over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries through competing private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Many of the Company’s leading drugs are already covered under Medicare Part B (e.g., TEMODAR, INTEGRILIN and INTRON A). Medicare Part B provides payment for physician services which can include prescription drugs administered incident to a physician’s services. Beginning in 2005 the Medicare Part B drugs will be reimbursed in a manner that may limit Schering-Plough’s ability to offer larger price concessions or make large price increases on these drugs. Other Schering-Plough drugs have a relatively small portion of their sales to the Medicare population (e.g., CLARINEX, the hepatitis C franchise). The Company could experience expanded utilization of VYTORIN and ZETIA and new drugs in the Company’s R&D pipeline. Of greater consequence for the Company may be the legislation’s impact on pricing, rebates and discounts. A significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. The Company’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as the Company’s products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. The Company launched OTC CLARITIN in the U.S. in December 2002. Also in December 2002, a competing OTC loratadine product was launched in the U.S. and private-label competition was introduced. The Company continues to market CLARINEX (desloratadine) 5 mg Tablets for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, which combines the indication of seasonal allergic rhinitis with the indication of perennial allergic rhinitis, as well as the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria, or hives of unknown cause. The ability of the Company to capture and maintain market share for CLARINEX and OTC CLARITIN in the U.S. market will depend on a number of factors, including: additional entrants in the market for allergy treatments; clinical differentiation of CLARINEX from other allergy treatments and the perception of the extent of such differentiation in the marketplace; the pricing differentials among OTC CLARITIN, CLARINEX, other allergy treatments and generic OTC loratadine; the erosion rate of OTC CLARITIN and CLARINEX sales upon the entry of additional generic OTC loratadine products; and whether or not one or both of the other branded second-generation antihistamines are switched from prescription to OTC status. CLARINEX is experiencing intense competition in the prescription U.S. allergy market. The prescription allergy market has been shrinking since the OTC switch of CLARITIN in December 2002. Additionally, the Company is implementing new marketing efforts to address market share performance for CLARINEX. The switch of CLARITIN to OTC status and the introduction of competing OTC loratadine have resulted in a rapid, sharp and material decline in CLARITIN sales in the U.S. and the Company’s results of operations. U.S. sales of prescription CLARITIN products were $25 million or 0.3 percent of the Company’s consolidated global sales in 2003 and $1.4 billion or 14 percent in 2002. Sales of CLARINEX in the U.S. and abroad have also been materially adversely affected by the presence of generic OTC loratadine and OTC CLARITIN. In light of the factors described above, management believes that the Company’s December 2002 introduction of OTC CLARITIN, as well as the introduction of a competing OTC loratadine product in December 2002 and additional entrants of generic OTC loratadine products in the market, have had a rapid, sharp and material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in 2003 and 2004. 36 Table of Contents PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy for hepatitis C has contributed substantially to sales in 2003 and 2002 and to a lesser extent in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2002, a competing pegylated interferon-based combination product, including a brand of ribavirin, received regulatory approval in most major markets, including the U.S. The overall market share of the hepatitis C franchise has declined sharply, reflecting this new market competition. In addition, the overall market value has contracted. Management believes that the ability of PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy to maintain market share will continue to be adversely affected by competition in the hepatitis C marketplace. Generic forms of ribavirin entered the U.S. market in April 2004. In October 2004, another generic ribavirin was approved by the FDA. The generic forms of ribavirin compete with the Company’s REBETOL (ribavirin) Capsules in the U.S. Prior to the second half of 2004 the REBETOL patents were material to the Company’s business. As a result of the introduction of a competitor for pegylated interferon and the introduction of generic ribavirin, the value of an important Company product franchise has been severely diminished and earnings and cash flow have been materially and negatively impacted. In October 2002, Merck/ Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals announced that the FDA approved ZETIA (ezetimibe) 10 mg for use either by itself or together with statins for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. In March 2003, the Company announced that ezetimibe (EZETROL, as marketed in Europe) had successfully completed the European Union (EU) mutual recognition procedure (MRP). With the completion of the MRP process, the 15 EU member states as well as Iceland and Norway can grant national marketing authorization with unified labeling for EZETROL. EZETROL has been launched in many international markets. The Merck/ Schering-Plough partnership also developed a once-daily tablet combining ezetimibe with simvastatin (Zocor), Merck’s cholesterol-modifying medicine. This product is marketed as VYTORIN in the U.S. and INEGY in many international markets. Ezetimibe/simvastatin has been approved for marketing in several countries, including Germany in April of 2004 and in Mexico in March of 2004. On July 23, 2004, Merck/ Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals announced that the FDA had approved VYTORIN. INEGY completed the MRP in Europe on October 1, 2004. In September 2004, the Company announced that it entered into an agreement with Bayer intended to enhance the companies’ pharmaceutical resources. The agreement was entered into by the Company primarily for strategic purposes. Commencing in October 2004, in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, the Company began marketing, selling and distributing Bayer’s primary care products including AVELOX and CIPRO under an exclusive license agreement. The Company will pay Bayer royalties in excess of 50 percent on these products based on sales, which will have an unfavorable impact on the Company’s gross margin percentage. Also commencing in October 2004, the Company assumed Bayer’s responsibilities for U.S. commercialization activities related to the erectile dysfunction medicine LEVITRA under Bayer’s co-promotion agreement with GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The Company reports its share of LEVITRA results as alliance revenue. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Bayer supports the promotion of certain of the Company’s oncology products in the U.S. and key European markets for a defined period of time. In Japan, upon regulatory approval Bayer will co-market the Company’s cholesterol absorption inhibitor ZETIA. This arrangement does not include the rights to any future cholesterol combination product. ZETIA was filed with regulatory authorities in Japan during the fourth quarter of 2003. This agreement with Bayer potentially restricts the Company from marketing products in the U.S. that would compete with any of the products under the strategic alliance. As a result, the Company expects that it may need to sublicense rights to garenoxacin, the quinolone antibacterial agent that the Company licensed from Toyama. The Company is exploring its options with regard to garenoxacin and will continue to fulfill its commitments to Toyama under its arrangement, including taking the product through regulatory approval. 37 Table of Contents Uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect the Company’s operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies and is, therefore, subject to potential administrative actions. Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S. It has jurisdiction over all the Company’s businesses and administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, approval, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of the Company’s products. From time to time, agencies, including the FDA, may require the Company to address various manufacturing, advertising, labeling or other regulatory issues, such as those noted below relating to the Company’s current manufacturing issues. Failure to comply with governmental regulations can result in delays in the release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, discontinuance of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Any such result could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and its results of operations. Additional information regarding government regulation that may affect future results is provided in Part I, Item I, Business, in this annual report on Form 10-K. Additional information about cautionary factors that may affect future results is provided under the caption Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results (Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations and Financial Condition. As included in Note 14 “Consent Decree,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on May 17, 2002, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with the FDA for a consent decree to resolve issues involving the Company’s compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices at certain manufacturing facilities in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey approved and entered the consent decree on May 20, 2002. Under terms of the consent decree, the Company agreed to pay a total of $500 million to the U.S. government in two equal installments of $250 million; the first installment was paid in May 2002 and the second installment was paid in May 2003. As previously reported, the Company accrued a $500 million provision for this consent decree in the fourth quarter of 2001. The consent decree requires the Company to complete a number of actions. In the event certain actions agreed upon in the consent decree are not satisfactorily completed on time, the FDA may assess payments for each deadline missed. The consent decree required the Company to develop and submit for the FDA’s concurrence comprehensive cGMP Work Plans for the Company’s manufacturing facilities in New Jersey and Puerto Rico that are covered by the decree. The Company received FDA concurrence with its proposed cGMP Work Plans on May 14, 2003. The cGMP Work Plans contain a number of Significant Steps whose timely and satisfactory completion are subject to payments of $15,000 per business day for each deadline missed. These payments may not exceed $25 million for 2002, and $50 million for each of the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. These payments are subject to an overall cap of $175 million. In connection with its discussions with the FDA regarding the Company’s cGMP Work Plans, and pursuant to the terms of the decree, the Company and the FDA entered into a letter agreement dated April 14, 2003. In the letter agreement, the Company and the FDA agreed to extend by six months the time period during which the Company may incur payments as described above with respect to certain of the Significant Steps whose due dates are December 31, 2005. The letter agreement does not increase the yearly or overall caps on payments described above. In addition, the decree requires the Company to complete programs of revalidation of the finished drug products and bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured at the covered manufacturing facilities. The Company is required under the consent decree to complete its revalidation programs for bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients by September 30, 2005, and for finished drugs by December 31, 2005. In general, the timely and satisfactory completions of the revalidations are subject to payments of $15,000 per business day for each deadline missed, subject to the caps described above. However, if a product scheduled for revalidation has not been certified as having been validated by the last date on the validation schedule, the FDA may assess a payment of 24.6 percent of the net domestic sales of the uncertified product until the 38 Table of Contents validation is certified. Any such payment would not be subject to the caps described above. Further, in general, if a product scheduled for revalidation under the consent decree is not certified within six months of its scheduled date, the Company must cease production of that product until certification is obtained. The completion of the Significant Steps in the Work Plans and the completion of the revalidation programs are subject to third-party expert certification, as well as the FDA’s acceptance of such certification. The consent decree provides that if the Company believes that it may not be able to meet a deadline, the Company has the right, upon the showing of good cause, to request extensions of deadlines in connection with the cGMP Work Plans and revalidation programs. However, there is no guarantee that FDA will grant any such requests. Although the Company believes it has made significant progress in meeting its obligations under the consent decree, it is possible that (1) the Company may fail to complete a Significant Step or a revalidation by the prescribed deadline; (2) the third-party expert may not certify the completion of the Significant Step or revalidation; or (3) the FDA may disagree with an expert’s certification of a Significant Step or revalidation. In such a case, it is possible that the FDA may assess payments as described above. The Company would expense any payments assessed under the decree if and when incurred. In addition, the failure to meet the terms of the consent decree could result in delays in approval of new products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. In April 2003, the Company received notice of a False Claims Act complaint brought by an individual purporting to act on behalf of the U.S. government against it and approximately 25 other pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that the pharmaceutical companies, including the Company, have defrauded the U.S. by having made sales to various federal governmental agencies of drugs that were allegedly manufactured in a manner that did not comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices. The Company and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in this action on April 12, 2004. The Company is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the European Union (EU) and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug in order to alert the manufacturer of the drug and the governmental agency to potential problems. During 2003 pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), serious deficiencies in reporting processes were identified. The Company is taking urgent actions to rectify these deficiencies as quickly as possible. The Company does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to these findings. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against the Company and/or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for the Company’s products. The Company sells numerous upper respiratory products which contain pseudoephedrine (PSE), an FDA-approved ingredient for the relief of nasal congestion. The Company’s annual sales of upper respiratory products that contain PSE totaled approximately $195 million in 2004 and approximately $160 million in 2003. These products include all CLARITIN-D products as well as some DRIXORAL, CORICIDIN and CHLOR-TRIMETON products. The Company understands that PSE has been used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine, a dangerous and addictive drug. As of February 2005, 12 states and Canada have enacted regulations concerning the sale of PSE, including limiting the amount of these products that can be purchased at one time, or requiring that these products be located behind the pharmacist’s counter, with the stated goal of deterring the illicit/illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. An additional eight states have enacted limits on the quantity of PSE any person can possess. To date, the regulations have not had a material impact on the Company’s operations or financial results. 39 Table of Contents As described more specifically in Note 16 “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of the Company and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorney’s Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti-kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject the Company to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, and the Company also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on the Company, its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 151 Inventory Costs. This SFAS requires that abnormal spoilage be expensed in the period incurred (as opposed to inventoried and amortized to income over inventory usage) and that fixed production facility overhead costs be allocated over the normal production level of a facility. This SFAS is effective for inventory costs incurred for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not anticipate any material impact from the implementation of this accounting standard. In December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123R (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment. Statement 123R requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of all share-based payments granted to employees. Companies are required to implement this SFAS in July 2005 by recognizing compensation on all share-based grants made after July 1, 2005, and for the unvested portion of share-based grants made prior to July 1, 2005. Restatement of previously issued statements is allowed, but not required. The Company is currently evaluating the various implementation options available and related financial impacts under SFAS 123R. Critical Accounting Policies The following accounting policies are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the Company’s financial statements: • Revenue Recognition • Rebates, Discounts and Returns • Provision for Income Taxes • Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property • Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition The Company’s pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers (e.g., wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations). Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies as well as to indirect purchasers and other market participants (e.g., managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers). 40 Table of Contents The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain Federal and state governmental programs and; iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. When recognizing revenue, the Company estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re-evaluated as part of this process. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made, the Company defers the recognition of revenue. Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, the Company would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of accruals. During 2004, the Company entered into agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers. These agreements deal with a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of this monitoring and the above noted agreements, the Company expects to avoid situations where the Company’s shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Rebate accruals for federal and state governmental programs were $155 million at December 31, 2004, and $127 million at December 31, 2003. Commercial discounts and other rebate accruals were $123 million at December 31, 2004, and $211 million at December 31, 2003, respectively. These and other rebate accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized, resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of a liability, which is included in other accrued liabilities. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, the Company’s payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy the Company’s obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 16 “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. 41 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/ Returns/ Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 487 Provision for Rebates 417 Payments (476 ) (59 ) Provision for Returns 17 Returns (39 ) (22 ) Provision for Discounts 282 Discounts granted (256 ) 26 Accrued Rebates/ Returns/ Discounts, End of Period $ 432 Management makes estimates and uses assumptions in recording the above accruals. Actual amounts paid in the current period were consistent with those previously estimated. Provision for Income Taxes As of December 31, 2004, taxes have not been provided on approximately $2.2 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, after considering the impact of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. If certain assets associated with these earnings are repatriated to the U.S., additional tax provisions may be necessary. Tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. These potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations, including (1) intercompany terms of cross-border agreements between affiliates, for which management believes its intercompany terms are based on sound economic facts and circumstances and (2) utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property). The Company’s estimate of the accrual for tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may be materially greater or less than the amounts accrued. The Company records a tax valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination would be made. Likewise, should the Company subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $580 million at December 31, 2004. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $50 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2004. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and 42 Table of Contents marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. The Company’s manufacturing sites operate well below optimum levels due to sales declines and the reduction in output related to the FDA consent decree. At the same time, overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have increased due to the consent decree and other compliance activities. The impact of this is a material increase in manufacturing costs. The Company continues to review the carrying value of these assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related costs. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are also required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters. In particular, the Company has recognized estimated minimum liabilities in connection with certain of the government investigations into its sales and marketing activities. The ultimate resolution of this matter could involve amounts materially in excess of amounts accrued. This could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows or operations. See Note 16 “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Market Risk Disclosure The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company has subsidiaries in more than 50 countries. In 2004, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 61 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, the Company’s reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula-based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of foreign operations using derivative financial instruments. Because the Company’s foreign subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover provides a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that the Company’s foreign operations are widespread. In addition, at any point in time, the Company’s foreign subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short-term, third-party and intercompany receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect these financial assets and liabilities. Gains or losses that arise from translation do not affect net income. On occasion, the Company has used derivatives to hedge specific short-term risk situations involving foreign currency exposures. However, these derivative transactions have not been material. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk The only financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and/or equity prices are the debt and equity securities held in non-qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled $153 million at December 31, 2004. Due to the long-term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, the Company’s exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest expense are long-term and short-term borrowings. The Company maintains a cash and cash equivalent portfolio in excess of the amount of borrowings. 43 Table of Contents Accordingly, the Company has mitigated its exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its financial obligations. The Company has long-term debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of the debt by $127 million. However, the Company does not expect to refund this debt. Disclosure Notice Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results (Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. They use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “will,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of potential future events, circumstances or future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to future actions, ability to access the capital markets, prospective products, the status of product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, development programs, estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, expenses and programs to reduce expenses, the cost of and savings from reductions in work force, the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations, growth strategy and financial results. Any or all forward-looking statements here or in other publications may turn out to be wrong. Actual results may vary materially, and there are no guarantees about Schering-Plough’s financial and operational performance or the performance of Schering-Plough stock. Schering-Plough does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Many factors could cause actual results to differ from Schering-Plough’s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the following: • A significant portion of net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care products distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. • Competitive factors, including technological advances attained by competitors, patents granted to competitors, new products of competitors coming to the market, new indications for competitive products, and new and existing generic, prescription and/or OTC products that compete with products of Schering-Plough or the Merck/ Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals joint venture (such as competition from OTC statins, like the one approved for use in the U.K., the impact of which in the cholesterol reduction market is not yet known). • Increased pricing pressure both in the U.S. and abroad from managed care organizations, institutions and government agencies and programs. In the U.S., among other developments, consolidation among customers may increase pricing pressures and may result in various customers having greater influence over prescription decisions through formulary decisions and other policies. • The potential impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003; possible other U.S. legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement, including Medicaid and Medicare; involuntary approval of prescription medicines for over-the- counter use; and other health care reform initiatives and drug importation 44 Table of Contents legislation. Legislation or regulations in markets outside the U.S. affecting product pricing, reimbursement or access. Laws and regulations relating to trade, antitrust, monetary and fiscal policies, taxes, price controls and possible nationalization. • Patent positions can be highly uncertain and patent disputes are not unusual. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively impact sales of existing products or result in injunctive relief and payment of financial remedies. • Uncertainties of the FDA approval process and the regulatory approval and review processes in other countries, including, without limitation, delays in approval of new products. • Failure to meet current Good Manufacturing Practices established by the FDA and other governmental authorities can result in delays in the approval of products, release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of products, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. The resolution of manufacturing issues with the FDA discussed in Schering-Plough’s 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties, including the timing, scope and duration of a resolution of the manufacturing issues, will depend on the ability of Schering- Plough to assure the FDA of the quality and reliability of its manufacturing systems and controls, and the extent of remedial and prospective obligations undertaken by Schering-Plough. • Difficulties in product development. Pharmaceutical product development is highly uncertain. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach market for numerous reasons. They may be found to be ineffective or to have harmful side effects in clinical or pre-clinical testing, they may fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, they may turn out not to be economically feasible because of manufacturing costs or other factors or they may be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others. • Post-marketing issues. Once a product is approved and marketed, clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance may raise efficacy or safety concerns. Whether or not scientifically justified, this new information could lead to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products, which may negatively impact sales. Concerns of prescribers or patients relating to the safety or efficacy of Schering-Plough products, or other companies’ products or pharmaceutical products generally, may also negatively impact sales. • Major products such as CLARITIN, CLARINEX, INTRON A, PEG-INTRON, REBETOL Capsules, REMICADE, TEMODAR and NASONEX accounted for a material portion of Schering-Plough’s 2004 revenues. If any major product were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection, OTC availability of the Company’s product or a competitive product (as has been disclosed for CLARITIN and its current and potential OTC competition), previously unknown side effects; if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced; generic availability of competitive products; or if the product is discontinued for any reason, the impact on revenues could be significant. Also, such information about important new products, such as ZETIA and VYTORIN, or important products in our pipeline, may impact future revenues. Further, sales of VYTORIN may negatively impact sales of ZETIA. • Unfavorable outcomes of government (local and federal, domestic and international) investigations, litigation about product pricing, product liability claims, other litigation and environmental concerns could preclude commercialization of products, negatively affect the profitability of existing products, materially and adversely impact Schering-Plough’s financial condition and results of operations, or contain conditions that impact business operations, such as exclusion from government reimbursement programs. • Economic factors over which Schering-Plough has no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 45 Table of Contents • Instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region — due to the location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or customers — regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. • Changes in tax laws including changes related to taxation of foreign earnings. • Changes in accounting and auditing standards promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that would require a significant change to Schering-Plough’s accounting practices. • For further details and a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, see Schering-Plough’s past and future SEC reports and filings.

310158,MRK,"Merck & Co., Inc.",2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of the Company Schering-Plough (the Company) discovers, develops, manufactures and markets medical therapies and treatments to enhance human health. The Company also markets leading consumer brands in the over-the-counter (OTC), foot care and sun care markets and operates a global animal health business. 23 Table of Contents As a research-based pharmaceutical company, a core strategy of Schering-Plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments with important medical and commercial value. Consistent with this core strategy, the Company has been increasing its investment in research and development, and this trend is expected to continue at historic levels or greater. Research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases. There is a high rate of failure inherent in such research and, as a result, there is a high risk that the funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to the commercial phase may take a decade or more. There are two sources of new products: products acquired through acquisition and licensing arrangements, and products in the Company’s late-stage research pipeline. With respect to acquisitions and licensing, there are limited opportunities for obtaining or licensing critical late-stage products, and these limited opportunities typically require substantial amounts of funding. The Company competes for these opportunities against companies often with greater financial resources. Accordingly, it may be challenging for the Company to acquire or license critical late-stage products that will have a positive material financial impact. The Company supports commercialized products with manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. The Company is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business, including capital expenditures for the development process, where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets, information technology systems, and post-marketing studies and monitoring. The Company’s financial situation continues to improve, as discussed below. The Company’s cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, are the primary drivers of this improvement. ZETIA is the Company’s novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor, Merck & Co., Inc.’s (Merck) statin medication. These two products have been launched through a joint venture between the Company and Merck. ZETIA (ezetimibe), marketed in Europe as EZETROL, is marketed for use either by itself or together with statins for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. ZETIA/ EZETROL has been launched in more than 60 countries. VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin), marketed as INEGY internationally, has been launched in over 20 countries, including the United States. The Company currently expects its cholesterol franchise to continue to grow. The financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with Merck and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. The operating results of the joint venture with Merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting. Outside of the joint venture with Merck, in the Japanese market, Bayer Healthcare will co-market the Company’s cholesterol-absorption inhibitor, ZETIA, upon approval. Due to a backlog of new drug applications in Japan, the Company cannot precisely predict the timing of this approval. The cholesterol-reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are competing in this market, and on a combined basis, these products continued to grow in terms of market share during 2005. As a franchise, the two products together have captured more than 14 percent of new prescriptions for the U.S. cholesterol management market (based on January 2006 IMS data). VYTORIN currently ranks as the third-leading prescription product for treating patients with high cholesterol (based on new prescriptions). To date, physicians have written more than 11 million total prescriptions for VYTORIN in the U.S. ZETIA sales continue to grow even as VYTORIN grows its market share. During 2005, the Company’s results of operations and cash flows were driven significantly by the performance of VYTORIN and ZETIA. As a result, the Company’s ability to generate profits is predominantly dependent upon the performance of the VYTORIN and ZETIA cholesterol franchise, which dependence is expected to continue for some time. For 2005, equity income from the cholesterol joint venture was $873 million and net income available to common shareholders was $183 million. Additional information regarding the joint venture with Merck is also included in Note 3, “Equity Income 24 Table of Contents from Cholesterol Joint Venture,” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K. Although it is expected that operating cash flow, existing cash and investments, including funds repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), will fund the Company’s operations for the near and intermediate term, as discussed in more detail below, future cash flows are also dependent upon the performance of VYTORIN and ZETIA. The Company must generate profits and cash flows to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and business as discussed above. Sales of the products may be impacted by the introduction of new innovative competing treatments and generic versions of existing products. In this regard, the Company expects that generic forms of Pravachol and Zocor, two existing well-established cholesterol-management products, will be introduced in the U.S. as they lose patent protection beginning in 2006 (generics have been introduced during 2005 in some international markets). The Company cannot reasonably predict what effect the introduction of generic forms of cholesterol management products may have on VYTORIN and ZETIA, although the decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and reimbursement policies could potentially negatively impact the dollar size and/or growth of the cholesterol management market, including VYTORIN and ZETIA. A material change in the sales or market share of VYTORIN and ZETIA would have a significant impact on the Company’s operations and cash flow. REMICADE is prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis, and recently gained approval in Europe for psoriasis. REMICADE is the Company’s second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line (after the cholesterol franchise). This product is licensed from and manufactured by Centocor, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company. The Company has the exclusive marketing rights to this product outside of the U.S., Japan, China (including Hong Kong), Taiwan and Indonesia. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company exercised an option under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, in the same territories as REMICADE. Golimumab is currently under Phase III trials. Centocor believes these rights to golimumab expire in 2014, while the Company believes these rights extend beyond 2014. The parties are working together to move forward with their collaboration on golimumab, and steps are being taken to resolve the difference of opinion as to the expiration date. As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, the Company licenses manufacturing, marketing and/or distribution rights to certain products to others, and also manufactures, markets and/or distributes products owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements. Any time that third parties are involved, there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of the Company that may create positive or negative impacts on the Company. VYTORIN, ZETIA and REMICADE are subject to such arrangements and are key to the Company’s current business and financial performance. In addition, any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements, which could result in VYTORIN and ZETIA being acquired by Merck or REMICADE reverting back to Centocor. The change in control provision relating to VYTORIN and ZETIA is included in the contract with Merck, filed as Exhibit 10(q) to the Company’s 10-K, and the change of control provision relating to REMICADE is contained in the contract with Centocor, filed as Exhibit 10(u) to the Company’s 10-K. During the period from 2002 to 2004, the Company experienced a number of negative events that have strained and continue to strain the Company’s financial resources. While as explained below, the Company’s overall financial situation began to improve in 2005, these negative events remain relevant to understand the Company’s current challenges. These negative events included, but were not limited to, the following matters: • Entered into a formal Consent Decree with the FDA in 2002 and agreed to implement a cGMP Work Plan and revalidate manufacturing processes at certain manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The Company has completed all of the significant steps of the cGMP Work Plan and validation actions required by December 31, 2005, under the Consent Decree. These are subject to certification by an external third party and review and approval by the FDA. Under the terms of 25 Table of Contents the Decree, provided that the FDA has not notified the Company of a significant violation of FDA law, regulations, or the Decree in the five year period since the Decree’s entry, May 2002 through May 2007, the Company may petition the court to have the Decree dissolved and the FDA will not oppose the Company’s petition. The Company has incurred significant costs associated with manufacturing compliance efforts as part of the Consent Decree. Incremental compliance costs will be incurred through the completion of the third party certification and FDA review and approval process. In addition, the Company has found it necessary to discontinue certain older profitable products and outsource other products. • Switch of CLARITIN in the U.S., beginning in December 2002, from prescription to OTC status. This switch coupled with private label competition has resulted in substantially lower overall sales of this product starting in 2003 as well as lower average unit selling price for this product and ongoing intense competition. The Company’s exposure to powerful retail purchasers has also increased. • Market shares and sales levels of certain other Company products fell significantly and have experienced increased competition. Some of these products continue to compete in declining or volatile markets. • Investigations into certain of the Company’s sales and marketing practices by the U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. During 2004, the Company made payments totaling $294 million to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in settlement of that investigation. In response to these matters, beginning in April 2003, the Board of Directors named Fred Hassan as the new Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Schering-Plough Corporation. Under his leadership, a new leadership team was recruited and a six- to eight-year, five-phase Action Agenda was formulated with the goal of stabilizing, repairing and turning around the Company. In October 2005, the Company announced that it has entered the third, Turnaround, phase of the Action Agenda. The beginning of the Turnaround phase had been defined as achieving three consecutive quarters of sales and earnings growth, excluding special items. Current State of the Business Net sales in 2005 were $9.5 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 15 percent, over the 2004 period. The increase was driven primarily by the growth of REMICADE, PEG-INTRON, NASONEX, TEMODAR and the Animal Health business, and the U.S. sales contribution from the antibiotics AVELOX and CIPRO and other products under the agreement with Bayer that became effective in October 2004. Foreign exchange contributed 1 percent to the sales increase. Sales and marketing costs have increased due to the addition of Bayer sales representatives, increased selling expenses in Europe to support the continued launches of VYTORIN and ZETIA, and increased promotional spending, primarily for NASONEX, ASMANEX and the products under the agreement with Bayer. The Company had net income available to common shareholders of $183 million for 2005, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of $981 million in 2004. Net income available to common shareholders for 2005 included a charge to increase the litigation reserves by $250 million resulting in a total reserve of $500 million representing the Company’s current estimate to resolve the Massachusetts investigation as well as the investigations disclosed under “AWP Investigations” and the state litigation disclosed under “AWP Litigation” in Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In addition, net income available to common shareholders also included research and development expense of approximately $124 million (or $118 million net of tax) for the license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab. Net loss available to common shareholders for 2004 included a pre-tax research and development charge of $80 million for the license of garenoxacin from Toyama Chemical Company Ltd., tax expense of $779 million which included a 26 Table of Contents provision for taxes related to the planned repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings during 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act, and a valuation reserve for net deferred tax assets in the U.S. Many of the Company’s manufacturing sites operate below capacity. The Company’s manufacturing sites subject to the Consent Decree remained open while the Company was performing its revalidation and cGMP Work Plan obligations under decree. However, the Consent Decree work placed significant additional controls on production and release of products from these sites, which increased costs and slowed production and led to a reduction in the product mix at the sites. Further, the Company’s research and development operations were negatively impacted by the Consent Decree because these operations share common facilities with the manufacturing operations. Although certain costs, such as those associated with third party certifications, will decrease when the completion of the Work Plan is certified, other financial impacts will continue, such as the costs of the new processes that will continue to be used and the reduced product mix and volumes at the sites. The Company’s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to significantly reduce the Company’s manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. In most cases, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction, revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related costs. During 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $9.4 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate as provided by the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). Repatriating funds under the AJCA benefits the Company in the following ways: • The Company’s U.S. operations currently incur significant negative cash flow. Operating cash flows, existing cash and investments, including repatriations made during 2005 under the AJCA, are expected to provide the Company with the ability to fund U.S. cash needs for the near and intermediate term. The Company will continue to use repatriated funds for AJCA qualified spending. • The U.S. operations during 2005 and 2004 produced U.S. tax net operating loss (U.S. NOL) carryforwards of approximately $1.5 billion. Under the AJCA, qualifying repatriations do not reduce U.S. tax losses. As such, the Company has both the cash necessary to fund its U.S. cash needs and the potential benefit of being able to carry forward U.S. NOLs to reduce future U.S. taxable income. This potential future benefit could be significant but is dependent on the Company achieving profitability in the U.S. DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales A significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. Consolidated net sales in 2005 totaled $9.5 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion or 15 percent compared with 2004. Consolidated net sales reflected higher volumes of REMICADE, PEG-INTRON, NASONEX, TEMODAR and the inclusion of a full year of sales of AVELOX and CIPRO. In addition, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 1 percent. Consolidated 2004 net sales of $8.3 billion had decreased $62 million or 1 percent as compared to 2003, primarily reflecting volume declines offset by a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 4 percent. 27 Table of Contents Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 (Dollars in millions) PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS $ 7,564 $ 6,417 $ 6,611 18 % (3 )% REMICADE 942 746 540 26 38 PEG-INTRON 751 563 802 33 (30 ) NASONEX 737 594 500 24 19 CLARINEX/ AERIUS 646 692 694 (7 ) 0 TEMODAR 588 459 324 28 42 CLARITIN Rx(a) 371 321 328 16 (2 ) REBETOL 331 287 639 15 (55 ) INTEGRILIN 315 325 306 (3 ) 6 INTRON A 287 318 409 (10 ) (22 ) AVELOX 228 44 — N/M N/M SUBUTEX 197 185 144 6 29 CAELYX 181 150 111 21 35 CIPRO 146 43 — N/M N/M ELOCON 144 168 154 (14 ) 9 Other Pharmaceutical 1,700 1,522 1,660 12 (8 ) CONSUMER HEALTH CARE 1,093 1,085 1,026 1 6 OTC(b) 556 578 588 (4 ) (2 ) Foot Care 333 331 292 1 13 Sun Care 204 176 146 16 20 ANIMAL HEALTH 851 770 697 11 10 CONSOLIDATED NET SALES $ 9,508 $ 8,272 $ 8,334 15 % (1 )% Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. N/ M — Not a meaningful percentage. (a) Amounts shown include international sales of CLARITIN Rx only. (b) Includes OTC CLARITIN of $394, $419, and $432 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. International net sales of REMICADE, for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis, were up $196 million or 26 percent in 2005 to $942 million due to greater demand, expanded indications and continued market growth. Sales of REMICADE in 2004 were $746 million, up $206 million or 38 percent compared with 2003, due to greater medical use and expanded indications in European markets. In the near future, additional competitive products for the indications referred to above are likely to be introduced. Global net sales of PEG-INTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, increased $188 million or 33 percent to $751 million compared with 2004 due to the December 2004 launch of the PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy in Japan. Sales in Japan benefited from the significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEG-INTRON before beginning treatment (patient warehousing). Comparisons in 2006 will be unfavorably impacted by the absence of this patient warehousing and anticipated government mandated price reductions in Japan. As a result of these factors, sales may decline materially. Sales of PEG-INTRON in the U.S. in 2005 have decreased, primarily reflecting a decline in the overall market. Sales of PEG-INTRON decreased 28 Table of Contents $239 million or 30 percent to $563 million in 2004, due primarily to loss of market share reflecting the entrance of a competitor’s new products in the hepatitis C market in 2003. Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once-daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 24 percent to $737 million in 2005 as the product captured greater U.S. and international market share versus the 2004 period. U.S. sales benefited from an increased promotional effort and the introduction, beginning in January 2005, of a new scent-free, alcohol-free formulation of NASONEX nasal spray. 2004 sales of NASONEX increased 19 percent versus 2003 to $594 million primarily due to international sales growth and favorable prior year trade inventory comparisons in the U.S., tempered by a decline in U.S. market share. Generic Flonase (fluticasone propionate) was approved in 2006 and may unfavorably impact the corticosteroid nasal spray market. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.), for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year-round indoor allergies, decreased $46 million, or 7 percent, versus 2004. Sales in the U.S. decreased $95 million or 23 percent versus 2004 due to reduced market share in a declining market. In September 2005, generic Allegra (fexofenadine) was introduced to the U.S., which will continue to negatively affect the antihistamine market including CLARINEX. Sales outside the U.S. increased $49 million or 18 percent to $321 million in 2005 due primarily to market share gains. Global net sales of CLARINEX were $692 million in 2004, essentially flat versus 2003. Sales outside the U.S. increased 39 percent to $272 million in 2004 due to market share gains and continued conversion from prescription CLARITIN. U.S. sales decreased 16 percent to $420 million in 2004 due to the continued contraction in the U.S. prescription antihistamine market following the launch of OTC CLARITIN and other branded and non-branded non-sedating antihistamines coupled with market share declines. Global net sales of TEMODAR Capsules, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased $129 million or 28 percent to $588 million in 2005 due to increased utilization for treating newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is the most prevalent form of brain cancer. This new indication was granted U.S. FDA approval in March 2005 and was rapidly adopted by U.S. physicians. In June 2005, TEMODAR received approval from the European Commission for use in combination with radiotherapy for GBM patients in 25 member states as well as in Iceland and Norway. In Japan, TEMODAR was granted a priority review of the regulatory application to treat malignant glioma in the 2005 fourth quarter. Sales of TEMODAR increased $135 million or 42 percent to $459 million in 2004 due to increased market penetration. The growth rates for TEMODAR may moderate going forward, as significant market penetration has already been achieved in the treatment of GBM, especially in the U.S. International net sales of prescription CLARITIN increased $50 million or 16 percent to $371 million in 2005 due to the launch of CLARITIN REDITABS in Japan coupled with an unusually severe Japanese allergy season that may not recur in 2006. In 2004, international sales of prescription CLARITIN were $321 million, a decrease of 2 percent compared to 2003 due to continued conversion to CLARINEX. Global net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with INTRON A or PEG-INTRON for treating hepatitis C, increased $44 million or 15 percent to $331 million in 2005 due primarily to the launch of the PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy in Japan in December 2004. Sales in Japan benefited from the significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEG-INTRON before beginning treatment (patient warehousing). Comparisons in 2006 will be unfavorably impacted by the absence of this patient warehousing and, as a result, sales may decline materially. REBETOL may also be subject to larger than average government mandated price reductions in Japan. Sales of REBETOL in 2004 decreased 55 percent to $287 million due to the launch of generic versions of REBETOL in the U.S. in April 2004 and increased price competition outside the U.S. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold primarily in the U.S. by the Company, were $315 million in 2005 compared with $325 million in 2004. While sales of INTEGRILIN in the U.S. were essentially flat versus 2004, sales outside the U.S. decreased $8 million, reflecting the return of 29 Table of Contents European marketing rights to Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Millennium). Sales of INTEGRILIN in 2004 increased $19 million or 6 percent versus 2003 due to increased patient utilization. Effective September 1, 2005, the Company restructured its INTEGRILIN co-promotion agreement with Millennium. Under the terms of the restructured agreement, the Company acquired exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN in exchange for an upfront payment of $36 million and royalties on INTEGRILIN sales. The restructured agreement calls for minimum royalty payments of $85 million per year to Millennium for 2006 and 2007. Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, decreased 10 percent in 2005 to $287 million due to the conversion to PEG-INTRON in Japan. Sales of INTRON A decreased 22 percent in 2004 to $318 million due primarily to lower demand. Net sales of AVELOX, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering-Plough as a result of the Company’s license agreement with Bayer, were $228 million in 2005. Sales of AVELOX in 2004 represented the initial three months of sales under the agreement with Bayer, which was effective October 1, 2004. International net sales of SUBUTEX Tablets, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 6 percent to $197 million in 2005 due to increased market penetration. Sales of SUBUTEX were $185 million in 2004, an increase of 29 percent over 2003 due to increased market penetration. It is expected that SUBUTEX will encounter generic competition in the near future. International sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma, increased 21 percent to $181 million, reflecting further adoption of the ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer indications. Sales of CAELYX in 2004 increased 35 percent versus 2003 to $150 million, reflecting initial adoption of the metastatic breast cancer indication. Net sales of CIPRO, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory, skin, urinary tract and other infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering-Plough as a result of the Company’s license agreement with Bayer, were $146 million in 2005. Sales of CIPRO in 2004 represented the initial three months of sales under the agreement with Bayer. Global net sales of ELOCON cream, a medium-potency topical steroid, decreased 14 percent to $144 million, reflecting generic competition introduced in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2005. Generic competition is expected to continue to adversely affect sales of this product. Other pharmaceutical net sales include a large number of lower sales volume prescription pharmaceutical products. Several of these products are sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. The products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. Global net sales of Consumer Health Care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, were $1.1 billion in 2005 and 2004. Sales of OTC CLARITIN were $394 million in 2005, a decrease of $25 million or 6 percent from 2004, reflecting the adverse impact on sales of CLARITIN-D due to restrictions on the retail sale of OTC products containing pseudoephedrine (PSE) that came into effect during 2005. Sales of CLARITIN-D may continue to be adversely affected by both recent and future restrictions on the retail sale of such products. In addition, OTC CLARITIN continues to face competition from private label and branded loratadine. Net sales of sun care products increased $28 million or 16 percent in 2005, primarily due to the launch of new COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY products coupled with a stronger overall suncare season in the U.S. Net sales of foot care products increased $2 million or 1 percent in 2005, due primarily to the new MEMORY FIT and FOR HER INSOLES and other insole products. Net sales of Consumer Health Care products in 2004 increased $59 million or 6 percent compared to 2003, due primarily to the strong performance of DR. SCHOLL’S FREEZE AWAY and other foot care products. 30 Table of Contents The Company sells numerous non-prescription upper respiratory products that contain PSE, an FDA-approved ingredient for the relief of nasal congestion. The Company’s annual North American sales of non-prescription upper respiratory products that contain PSE totaled approximately $277 million in 2005, $305 million in 2004 and approximately $160 million in 2003. These products include all CLARITIN-D products as well as some DRIXORAL, CORICIDIN and CHLOR-TRIMETON products. The Company understands that PSE has been used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine, a dangerous and addictive drug. As of December 31, 2005, 26 states, Canada and Mexico have enacted regulations concerning the non-prescription sale of products containing PSE, including limiting the amount of these products that can be purchased at one time or requiring that these products be located behind the pharmacist’s counter, with the stated goal of deterring the illicit/illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. An additional 12 states have enacted limits on the quantity of PSE any person can possess. One state has recently enacted legislation that regulates all PSE products to prescription status. Also, the U.S. federal government has proposed legislation placing restrictions on the sale of products containing PSE. Further, major U.S. retailers that are customers of the Company have voluntarily placed non-prescription products containing PSE behind the pharmacy counter at all of their stores, whether or not required by local law. Sales of non-prescription PSE products were down $28 million or approximately 9 percent as compared to 2004. The Company continues to monitor developments in this area that could have a further negative impact on operations or financial results. It should be noted that these regulations do not relate to the sale of prescription products, such as CLARINEX-D products, that contain PSE. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 11 percent in 2005 to $851 million. The increased sales reflected strong growth of core brands across most geographic and species areas, led by products serving the U.S. cattle market, including NUFLOR, and the vaccine business. The increased sales were also due in part to better product supply in the U.S. The sales growth included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 1 percent. The Company expects this growth rate to moderate due to increased competition, including generic products. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 10 percent in 2004, which included a favorable foreign exchange impact of 6 percent. Certain situations that had a positive impact on sales and net income in 2005 may not recur in 2006. These include the favorable effect of foreign exchange, the patient warehousing benefit to PEG-INTRON and REBETOL related to the launch of PEG-INTRON in Japan, and an unusually severe allergy season in Japan that benefited the reported sales of prescription CLARITIN. Generic Allegra (fexofenadine) was introduced in the U.S. during 2005, which is expected to have a negative impact on U.S. CLARINEX sales in 2006. Generic Flonase (fluticasone propionate) was approved in 2006 and may unfavorably impact the corticosteroid nasal spray market. The growth of REMICADE may also be affected by increased competition. In addition, the Company expects the growth rate for the Animal Health business to moderate due to increased competition, including generic products. 31 Table of Contents Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 (Dollars in millions) Cost of sales $ 3,346 $ 3,070 $ 2,833 9 % 8 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 4,374 3,811 3,474 15 % 10 % Research and development (R&D) 1,865 1,607 1,469 16 % 9 % Other expense/(income), net 5 146 59 N/M N/M Special charges 294 153 599 N/M N/M Equity income from cholesterol joint venture (873 ) (347 ) (54 ) N/M N/M N/ M — Not a meaningful percentage Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in the Company’s net sales. The results of these sales are reflected in equity income from cholesterol joint venture. In addition, due to the virtual nature of the joint venture, the Company incurs substantial selling, general and administrative expenses that are not captured in equity income but are included in the Company’s Statements of Consolidated Operations. As a result, the Company’s gross margin, and ratios of SG&A expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales do not reflect the impact of the joint venture’s operating results. Gross margin Gross margin increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 from 62.9 percent to 64.8 percent, primarily due to supply chain process improvements, increased sales of higher-margin products and a favorable impact from foreign exchange, partly offset by higher royalties related to the Bayer products and beginning September 1, 2005, royalties for INTEGRILIN. The restructuring of the INTEGRILIN agreement has substantially offsetting effects, generally increasing cost of sales due to increased royalties offset by reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. Gross margin in 2006 will be unfavorably impacted by a full year of the increased royalties from this restructured agreement. Gross margin in 2004 decreased as compared to 2003 from 66.0 percent to 62.9 percent, primarily due to lower production volumes coupled with increased spending related to the FDA Consent Decree, other manufacturing compliance spending and efforts to upgrade the Company’s global infrastructure. The absence of European LOSEC revenues and a change in product sales mix, including sales of Bayer licensed products, contributed to the unfavorable comparison as well. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 15 percent to $4.4 billion in 2005 versus $3.8 billion in 2004. This increase was primarily due to the addition in the 2004 fourth quarter of Bayer sales representatives, increased selling expenses in Europe to support the continued launch of VYTORIN and ZETIA, and increased promotional spending, primarily for NASONEX, ASMANEX and the products under the agreement with Bayer. SG&A expenses increased 10 percent to $3.8 billion in 2004 from $3.5 billion in 2003 primarily due to the expansion of the sales field force, higher employee-related costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by lower promotional spending. Research and development Research and development (R&D) spending increased 16 percent to $1.9 billion, representing 19.6 percent of net sales in 2005, and included a $124 million charge in conjunction with the Company’s exercise of its rights to develop and commercialize golimumab. R&D spending for 2004 included an $80 million charge in conjunction with the license from Toyama Chemical Company Ltd. for garenoxacin. Generally, changes in R&D spending reflect the timing of the Company’s funding of both internal research 32 Table of Contents efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. The Company believes it has a strong Early Development pipeline across a wide-range of therapeutic areas with 14 preclinical/ Phase I compounds in 2005. Additionally, as the later phase growth-drivers of the pipeline enter Phase III (e.g., Thrombin Receptor Antagonist, vicriviroc and HCV protease inhibitor), the Company anticipates an approximate doubling of annual patient enrollment in clinical trials over the next 2-4 years versus 2005 levels. The Company expects R&D spending to increase as compared to prior years due to the progression of the Company’s early-stage pipeline and increased clinical trial activity. To maximize the Company’s chances for the successful development of new products, the Company began a Development Excellence initiative in 2005 to build talent and critical mass, create a uniform level of excellence and deliver on high-priority programs within R&D. Other expense/(income), net In 2005, Other expense/(income), net, of $5 million was lower than 2004 as it reflected higher net interest income due to higher interest rates on cash equivalents and short-term investments. The increase in Other expense/(income), net, in 2004 versus 2003 was primarily the result of higher net interest expense due to debt issuances in 2003. Special charges The components of special charges are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions) Litigation charges $ 250 $ — $ 350 Employee termination costs 28 119 179 Asset impairment and other charges 16 34 70 $ 294 $ 153 $ 599 Litigation charges In 2005, litigation reserves were increased by $250 million. This increase resulted in a total reserve of $500 million for the Massachusetts investigation as well as the investigations disclosed under “AWP Investigations” and the state litigation disclosed under “AWP Litigation” in Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” representing the Company’s current estimate to resolve this matter. Additional information regarding litigation reserves is also included in Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K. In 2003, litigation reserves were increased by $350 million, primarily as a result of the investigations into the Company’s sales and marketing practices. Employee termination costs In August 2003, the Company announced a global workforce reduction initiative. The first phase of this initiative was a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the U.S. Under this program, eligible employees in the U.S. had until December 15, 2003 to elect early retirement and receive an enhanced retirement benefit. Approximately 900 employees elected to retire under the program, all of which have retired by December 31, 2005. The total cost of this program was approximately $191 million, comprised of increased pension costs of $108 million, increased post-retirement health care costs of $57 million, vacation payments of $4 million and costs related to accelerated vesting of stock grants of 33 Table of Contents $22 million. Amounts recognized in 2005, 2004 and 2003 for this program were $7 million, $20 million and $164 million, respectively. No additional amounts are expected to be recognized under this program. Termination costs not associated with the VERP totaled $21 million, $99 million and $15 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to employee termination costs: Employee Termination Costs (Dollars in millions) Special charges incurred during 2003 $ 179 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (144 ) Disbursements (6 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2003 $ 29 Special charges incurred during 2004 $ 119 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (20 ) Disbursements (110 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2004 $ 18 Special charges incurred during 2005 $ 28 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (7 ) Disbursements (35 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2005 $ 4 Asset impairment and other charges For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized asset impairment and other charges of $16 million related primarily to the consolidation of the Company’s U.S. biotechnology organizations. The Company recorded asset impairment and other charges of $34 million in 2004, related primarily to the shutdown of a small European research and development facility. Asset impairment and other charges in 2003 were $70 million and related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom, the write-down of production equipment related to products that were no longer going to be produced at a manufacturing site operating under the FDA Consent Decree, and the write-down of a drug license and a sun care trade name for which expected cash flows did not support the carrying value. Equity Income from Cholesterol Joint Venture Global cholesterol franchise sales, which include sales made by the Company and the cholesterol joint venture with Merck of VYTORIN and ZETIA, totaled $2.4 billion, $1.2 billion and $471 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 sales comparison benefited from the U.S. launch of VYTORIN in the second half of 2004. As a franchise, the two products combined have passed the 14 percent share level of new prescriptions in the U.S. cholesterol management market (based on January 2006 IMS data). VYTORIN has been launched in more than 20 countries, including the U.S. in August 2004. ZETIA has been approved in more than 70 countries and has been launched in more than 60 countries. The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting for the joint venture. Sharing of income from operations is based upon percentages that vary by product, sales level and country. The Company’s allocation of joint venture income is increased by milestones earned. Merck and Schering-Plough (the Partners) bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the joint venture reimburses each Partner for a pre-defined amount of physician details that are set on an annual basis. The Company 34 Table of Contents reports this reimbursement as part of equity income from the cholesterol joint venture. This reimbursement does not represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs for the Company’s detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, this reimbursement amount is not reflective of Schering-Plough’s sales effort related to the joint venture as Schering-Plough’s sales force and related costs associated with the joint venture are generally estimated to be higher. Costs of the joint venture that the Partners contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct-to-consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out-of-pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by the Partners. Equity income from cholesterol joint venture totaled $873 million, $347 million and $54 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 equity income comparison benefited from the U.S. launch of VYTORIN in the second half of 2004. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized milestones from Merck of $20 million, $7 million and $20 million, respectively. The $20 million milestone in 2005 related to certain European approvals of VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) in 2005. The $7 million milestone in 2004 related to the approval of ezetimibe/simvastatin in Mexico in 2004. The $20 million milestone in 2003 related to certain European approvals of ZETIA in 2003. These amounts are included in equity income. Under certain other conditions, as specified in the joint venture agreements with Merck, the Company could earn additional milestones totaling $105 million. It should be noted that the Company incurs substantial selling, general and administrative and other costs, which are not reflected in equity income from the cholesterol joint venture and instead are included in the overall cost structure of the Company. Provision for Income Taxes Tax expense was $228 million, $779 million, and $46 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The overall income tax expense in 2005, net of the benefit described below, primarily related to foreign taxes and does not include any benefit related to U.S. Net Operating Losses (NOLs). The Company has established a valuation allowance on net U.S. deferred tax assets, including the benefit of U.S. NOLs, as management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of U.S. net deferred tax assets can be realized. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had U.S. NOL carryforwards totaling approximately $1.5 billion. The Company’s tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a U.S. federal income tax benefit of approximately $42 million as a result of an IRS Notice issued in August 2005. The provisions of this Notice resulted in a reduction of the previously accrued tax liability attributable to the AJCA repatriation, and also reduced the 2005 U.S. NOLs carried forward to subsequent years. The 2005 income tax provision includes a charge of approximately $260 million related to foreign taxes, $14 million for state taxes and a benefit of $46 million for U.S. federal taxes primarily related to the 2005 IRS Notice mentioned above. In January 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of the Company’s 1993 - 1996 federal income tax returns. The Company had made a cash payment in the third quarter of 2005 in the form of a tax deposit of approximately $239 million in anticipation of the settlement of the 1993 - 1996 tax examination and to prevent additional IRS interest charges. This payment fully satisfied the liability associated with the tax examination and was consistent with the previously recorded reserves. The IRS is currently examining the Company’s 1997 - 2002 federal income tax returns. 35 Table of Contents Net Income/(Loss) Available to Common Shareholders Net income available to common shareholders for 2005 includes the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $86 million related to the issuance of the 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in August 2004. The 2004 net loss available to common shareholders includes the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $34 million. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions) Cash flow from operating activities $ 882 $ (154 ) $ 601 Cash flow from investing activities (454 ) (621 ) (790 ) Cash flow from financing activities (633 ) 1,534 882 In 2005, cash flow from operating activities on a worldwide basis approximated cash payments for capital expenditures and dividends. International operations generate cash in excess of local cash needs. However, U.S. operations have cash needs well in excess of cash generated in the U.S. The U.S. operations must fund dividend payments, the majority of research and development costs and U.S. capital expenditures. In years prior to 2003, overall U.S. cash needs were funded primarily through operations. Cash requirements during 2005 in the U.S. including operating cash needs, capital expenditures, tax payments and dividends on common and preferred shares approximated $1.1 billion. In 2005, consolidated operating activities generated $882 million of cash, compared with a use of $154 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher net income and timing of payments of special charges related to litigation, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to sales growth, payments to tax authorities for tax liabilities related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA of approximately $375 million and tax deposits of $239 million for the anticipated settlement of certain tax contingencies for the tax years 1993 through 1996. Tax charges related to the AJCA were expensed in 2004. In 2004, operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a U.S. tax refund of $404 million as a result of loss carry back. However, cash flow was unfavorably impacted by a $473 million payment to the U.S. government for a tax deficiency related to certain transactions in tax years 1991 to 1992 and the payment of $294 million under the settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In 2003, operating activities provided approximately $601 million of cash. This amount includes the cash flow benefit from the reduction in accounts receivable following the end of sales of CLARITIN as a prescription product in the U.S. This amount also includes a $250 million payment under the terms of the FDA Consent Decree. Net cash used for investing activities during 2005 was $454 million, primarily related to $478 million of capital expenditures and the purchase of intangible assets of $51 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $43 million and the net reduction in short-term investments of $33 million. Net cash used for investing activities in 2004 was $621 million and included capital expenditures of $489 million and net purchases of investments of $264 million, partially offset by cash proceeds of $118 million from the transfer of license rights and $7 million from the dispositions of property and equipment. Net cash used for financing activities during 2005 was $633 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.5 billion in 2004. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2005 include the 36 Table of Contents payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $410 million and the repayment of $1.2 billion of commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by proceeds of $900 million from bank debt incurred by a foreign subsidiary related to funding of a portion of the repatriations under the AJCA during 2005. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 reflected proceeds of $1.4 billion from the preferred stock issuance and $546 million from the increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $354 million. As the Company’s financial situation has begun to improve, the Company is moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business. This includes expected capital expenditures of up to $300 million over the next several years for a pharmaceutical sciences center. This center will allow the Company to streamline and integrate the Company’s drug development process, where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to market. There will be additional related expenditures to upgrade equipment and staffing for this center. In 2006, the U.S. operations will continue to generate negative cash flow. Payments regarding litigation and investigations could increase cash needs. Operating cash flows, existing cash and investments, including repatriations made during 2005 under the AJCA, are expected to provide the Company with the ability to fund cash needs, including U.S. cash needs, for the near and intermediate term. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments less total debt was approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2005. In August 2004 the Company issued 6 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock (see Note 14, “Shareholders Equity,” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) and received net proceeds of $1.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. The proceeds were used to reduce short-term commercial paper borrowings, pay tax and litigation settlement amounts and litigation costs, and to fund operating expenses, shareholder dividends and capital expenditures. The preferred stock was issued under the Company’s $2.0 billion shelf registration. As of December 31, 2005, $563 million remains registered and unissued under the shelf registration. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On November 26, 2003, the Company issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. Proceeds from this offering of $2.4 billion were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying commercial paper outstanding in the U.S. Upon issuance, the notes were rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and A+ (on Credit Watch with negative implications) by Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moody’s or S&P is downgraded below A3 or A-, respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 12, “Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Other Commitments,” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K, for additional information. On July 14, 2004, Moody’s lowered its rating on the notes to Baa1. Accordingly, the interest payable on each note increased 25 basis points effective December 1, 2004. Therefore, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3 percent to 5.55 percent, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent. This adjustment to the interest rate payable on the notes increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $6 million annually. The Company has a revolving credit facility from a syndicate of major financial institutions. During March 2005, the Company negotiated an increase in the bank commitments from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion with no changes in the basic terms of the pre-existing credit facility. Concurrently with the increase in commitments under this facility, the Company terminated early a separate $250 million line of credit which would have matured in May 2006. There was no outstanding balance under this facility at the time it was terminated. 37 Table of Contents The existing $1.5 billion credit facility matures in May 2009 and requires the Company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent. This credit line is available for general corporate purposes and is considered as support to the Company’s commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under this credit facility may be drawn by the U.S. parent company or by its wholly-owned international subsidiaries when accompanied by a parent guarantee. This facility does not require compensating balances, however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. As of December 31, 2005, $325 million has been drawn under this facility by a wholly-owned international subsidiary for the purposes of funding AJCA related repatriations. In addition to the aforementioned credit facility, the Company entered into a $575 million credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2005, all of which was drawn as of December 31, 2005. This credit facility was utilized by a wholly-owned international subsidiary to fund repatriations under the AJCA. This credit facility requires the Company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent. These borrowings are payable no later than November 4, 2008. Any funds borrowed under this facility which are subsequently repaid may not be re-borrowed. All credit facility borrowings have been classified as short-term borrowings as the Company intends to repay these amounts in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, short-term borrowings, including the credit facilities mentioned above, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $298 million and $1.46 billion, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate for short-term borrowings at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 4.7 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. Credit Ratings The Company’s current unsecured senior credit ratings and outlook are as follows: Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings Long-term Short-term Outlook Moody’s Investors Service Baa1 P-2 Negative Standard and Poor’s A- A-2 Negative Fitch Ratings A- F-2 Negative The commercial paper ratings discussed above have not significantly affected the Company’s ability to issue or rollover its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, the Company believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as the Company, with one or more short-term credit ratings of P-2 from Moody’s, A-2 from S&P and/or F2 from Fitch to issue or rollover outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short-term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to these issuers is typically less than that of higher-rated companies. The Company maintains sizable lines of credit with commercial banks, as well as cash and short-term investments held by U.S. and international subsidiaries, to serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. The Company’s credit ratings could decline below their current levels. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on the Company’s short and long-term debt. As discussed above, the Company believes that existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will allow the Company to fund its U.S. cash needs for the near and intermediate term. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments due by period under the Company’s known contractual obligations at December 31, 2005, are as follows: Payments Due by Period Less More than than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 1,278 $ 1,278 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt obligations(1) 2,399 — 2 1 2,396 Operating lease obligations 249 76 108 33 32 Purchase obligations: Advertising contracts 107 107 — — — Research contracts(2) 161 140 12 7 2 Capital expenditure commitments 179 175 4 — — Other purchase obligations(3) 829 778 25 9 17 Other obligations(4) 912 269 170 25 448 Total $ 6,114 $ 2,823 $ 321 $ 75 $ 2,895 (1) Long-term debt obligations include the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2013 and $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2033 and excludes interest obligations. See Note 12, “Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Other Commitments,” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K, for additional information. (2) Research contracts do not include any potential milestone payments to be made since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by the Company without penalty. (3) Other purchase obligations consist of both cancelable and non-cancelable inventory and expense items. (4) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of the Company’s pension and deferred compensation plans, preferred stock dividends and other contractual obligations. REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. These regulations are described in more detail in Part I, Item I, Business, of this 10-K. Regulatory compliance is complex, as regulatory standards (including Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices) vary by jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. Regulatory compliance is costly. Regulatory compliance also impacts the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Further, failure to comply with regulations can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recall of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Regulatory compliance, and the cost of compliance failures, can have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, its cash flows or financial condition. Since 2002, the Company has been working under a U.S. FDA Consent Decree to resolve issues involving the Company’s compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at certain of its 39 Table of Contents manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. See details in Note 18, “Consent Decree” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, the Company made payments totaling $500 million. As of the end of 2005, the Company has completed the revalidation programs for bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug products, as well as all 212 Significant Steps of the cGMP Work Plan, in accordance with the schedules required by the Consent Decree. The Company’s completion of the cGMP Work Plan is currently pending certification by a third party expert, whose certification is in turn subject to acceptance by the FDA. Under the terms of the Decree, provided that the FDA has not notified the Company of a significant violation of FDA law, regulations, or the Decree in the five year period since the Decree’s entry, May 2002 through May 2007, the Company may petition the court to have the Decree dissolved and FDA will not oppose the Company’s petition. The Company is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the European Union (EU) and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug, in order to alert the manufacturer of the drug and the governmental agency to potential problems. During 2003, pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) cited serious deficiencies in reporting processes. The Company has continued to work on its long-term action plan to rectify the deficiencies and has provided regular updates to the EMEA. During the fourth quarter 2005, local UK and EMEA regulatory authorities conducted a follow up inspection to assess the Company’s implementation of its action plan. The inspectors acknowledged that progress had been made since 2003, but also continued to note significant concerns with the quality systems supporting the Company’s pharmacovigilance processes. Similarly, in a follow up inspection of the Company’s clinical trial practices in the UK, inspectors identified issues with respect to the Company’s management of clinical trials and related pharmacovigilance practices. The Company intends to continue upgrading skills, processes and systems in clinical practices and pharmacovigilance. The Company remains committed to accomplish this work and to invest significant resources in this area. Further, in February 2006, the Company announced a 2006 initiative for building clinical excellence (in trial design, execution and tracking), which will strengthen the Company’s scientific and compliance rigor on a global basis. The Company does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to the inspections. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against the Company and/or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for the Company’s products. Recently, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors’ within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. Company personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. Following this wake of recent product withdrawals of other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMEA and the PMDA have increased their focus on safety, when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re-reviewing select products which are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the United States, on advertising and promotion and in particular direct-to-consumer advertising. 40 Table of Contents Similarly, major health authorities, including the FDA, EMEA and PMDA, have also increased collaboration amongst themselves, especially with regard to the evaluation of safety and benefit/risk information. Media attention has also increased. In the current environment, a health authority regulatory action in one market, such as a safety labeling change, may have regulatory, prescribing and marketing implications in other markets to an extent not previously seen. Some health authorities, such as the PMDA in Japan, have publicly acknowledged a significant backlog in workload due to resource constraints within their agency. This backlog has caused long regulatory review times for new indications and products, including the initial approval of ZETIA in Japan, and has added to the uncertainty in predicting approval timelines in these markets. While the PMDA has committed to correcting the backlog, it is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. In 2005, the FDA issued a Final Rule removing the essential use designation for albuterol CFC products. The removal of this designation requires that all CFC albuterol products, including the Company’s PROVENTIL CFC, be removed from the market no later than December 31, 2008. This will necessitate a transition in the marketplace from albuterol CFC (PROVENTIL) to albuterol HFA (PROVENTIL HFA) no later than the end of 2008. It is difficult to predict what impact this transition will have on the albuterol marketplace and the Company’s products. These and other uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect the Company’s operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. The Company has nevertheless achieved a significant number of important regulatory approvals since 2004, including approvals for VYTORIN, CLARINEX D-24, CLARINEX REDITABS, CLARINEX D-12 and new indications for TEMODAR and NASONEX. Other significant approvals since 2004 include ASMANEX DPI (Dry Powder for Inhalation) in the United States, NOXAFIL in the EU, PEG-INTRON in Japan and new indications for REMICADE. The Company also has a number of significant regulatory submissions filed in major markets awaiting approval. As described more specifically in Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of the Company and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorney’s Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti-kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject the Company to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. The Company also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business. In the U.S., many of the Company’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In the U.S. market, the Company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans’ health care program and other government-funded programs. In most international markets, the Company operates in an environment of government mandated cost-containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price 41 Table of Contents cuts as methods to control costs. For example, Japan generally enacts biennial price reductions and this is expected to occur again in 2006. Pricing actions will occur in 2006 in certain major European markets. Since the Company is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company cannot predict what net effect the Medicare prescription drug benefit will have on markets and sales. The new Medicare Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D), which took effect January 1, 2006, offers voluntary prescription drug coverage, subsidized by Medicare, to over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries through competing private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Many of the Company’s leading drugs are already covered under Medicare Part B (e.g., TEMODAR, INTEGRILIN and INTRON A). Medicare Part B provides payment for physician services which can include prescription drugs administered along with other physician services. The manner in which drugs are reimbursed under Medicare Part B may limit the Company’s ability to offer larger price concessions or make large price increases on these drugs. Other Schering-Plough drugs have a relatively small portion of their sales to the Medicare population (e.g., CLARINEX, the hepatitis C franchise). The Company could experience expanded utilization of VYTORIN and ZETIA and new drugs in the Company’s R&D pipeline. Of greater consequence for the Company may be the legislation’s impact on pricing, rebates and discounts. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. The Company’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as the Company’s products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. 2006 OUTLOOK As it relates to financial performance, the Company anticipates that sales and profits of its pivotal cholesterol franchise will continue to grow in 2006. The Company’s gross margin improved in 2005 as a result of, among other things, operating efficiencies in its plants and reduced spending related to the Consent Decree. The improvement in gross margin is expected to moderate in 2006 and improvements may be offset by royalty payments to partners. The Company anticipates that R&D expenses may grow at a faster rate than net sales in 2006, but will depend on the timing of studies and the success of Phase II trials now underway for the Thrombin Receptor Antagonist, the Hepatitis Protease Inhibitor and the HIV drug vicriviroc. As the Company moves forward in the Action Agenda, additional investments are anticipated to enhance the infrastructure in areas such as clinical development, pharmacovigilance and information technology. The risks described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” could cause actual results to differ from the expectations provided in this section. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 151, “Inventory Costs.” This SFAS requires that abnormal spoilage be expensed in the period incurred (as 42 Table of Contents opposed to inventoried and amortized to income over inventory usage) and that fixed production facility overhead costs be allocated over the normal production level of a facility. The Company implemented SFAS 151 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The implementation of this SFAS did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47) for SFAS 143, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,” to clarify the term “conditional asset retirement obligations,” as used in SFAS 143. This term refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Accordingly, a company is required to recognize liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. This interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal year ending after December 15, 2005. Retroactive application is not required. The Company implemented FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The implementation of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R is effective for the Company on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize compensation costs related to all share-based transactions as well as compensation based on the market performance of Company shares on a fair value basis. The Company will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method. The modified prospective method requires the Company to recognize compensation costs on all share-based grants made on or after January 1, 2006 as well as the unrecognized cost of unvested awards at the date of adoption. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company will recognize share-based compensation costs over the service period, which is the earlier of the employees’ retirement eligibility date or the stated vesting period of the award. For grants issued to retirement eligible employees prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company will recognize compensation costs over the stated vesting period with acceleration of any unrecognized compensation costs upon the retirement of the employee. SFAS 123R also amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows,” to require that excess tax benefits that had been reflected as operating cash flows be reflected as financing cash flows. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K presents pro forma disclosures reflecting the effect on net income/(loss) as if stock based compensation had been applied under the SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” fair value method. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company’s 2006 compensation expense for stock options and deferred stock units is expected to be consistent with 2005 pro forma amounts but could be lower based on the timing and number of individual grants, the Company’s stock price and other assumptions necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, the Company has two compensation plans that will be accounted for under SFAS 123R as liability-based plans. The ultimate cash payout of these liability-based plans will be based on the Company’s stock price performance as compared to the stock price performance of its peer group. This change in accounting required by SFAS 123R will result in a cumulative effect of $26 million in income at January 1, 2006, in order to recognize the difference between the Company’s previously accrued liability as reported under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion Number 25 and the fair value of the liability for these plans. Future operating results will be impacted by the fluctuation in the fair value of the liability under these plans, which is required to be remeasured at each reporting date. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following accounting policies are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the Company’s financial statements: • Revenue Recognition • Rebates, Discounts and Returns • Provision for Income Taxes 43 Table of Contents • Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property • Accounting for Pensions and Post-retirement Benefit Plans • Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition The Company’s pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers (e.g., wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations). Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies as well as to indirect purchasers and other market participants (e.g., managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers). The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain federal and state governmental programs and; iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. When recognizing revenue, the Company estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re-evaluated as part of this process. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made, the Company defers the recognition of revenue. Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, the Company would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with wholesalers, managed-care organizations and government purchasers as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of third party demand and market research data as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of return reserves. During 2004, the Company entered into agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers. These agreements deal with a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of this monitoring and the above noted agreements, the Company expects to avoid situations where the Company’s shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Rebate accruals for federal and state governmental programs were $144 million at December 31, 2005 and $155 million at December 31, 2004. Commercial discounts and other rebate accruals were 44 Table of Contents $378 million at December 31, 2005, and $382 million at December 31, 2004. These and other rebate accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of liabilities, which are included in total current liabilities. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, the Company’s payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy the Company’s obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/ Returns/ Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 537 $ 594 Provision for Rebates 479 486 Payments (495 ) (524 ) (16 ) (38 ) Provision for Returns 116 277 Returns (167 ) (321 ) (51 ) (44 ) Provision for Discounts 459 294 Discounts granted (407 ) (269 ) 52 25 Accrued Rebates/ Returns/ Discounts, End of Period $ 522 $ 537 Management makes estimates and uses assumptions in recording the above accruals. Actual amounts paid in the current period were consistent with those previously estimated. Certain prior year amounts have been conformed to reflect the current year presentation. Provision for Income Taxes As of December 31, 2005, taxes have not been provided on approximately $3.1 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as the Company considers these earnings permanently reinvested in its international subsidiaries. The Company’s potential tax exposures result from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property). Although the Company’s cross border arrangements between affiliates are based upon internationally accepted standards, tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their country. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matters could materially affect shareholders’ equity, liquidity and/or cash flows. The Company believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years, based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities. The Company accrues liabilities for identified tax contingencies that result from tax positions taken that could be challenged by tax authorities. While the Company believes that its tax reserves reflect the probable 45 Table of Contents outcome of identified tax contingencies, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may be materially greater or less than the amount accrued. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or an additional portion of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should the Company subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or an additional portion of its remaining net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $569 million at December 31, 2005. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $50 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2005. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. Many of the Company’s manufacturing sites operate below capacity. Overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased due to the Consent Decree and other compliance activities. The Company’s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to significantly reduce the Company’s manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. In most cases, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction, revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related costs. Accounting for Pension and Post-retirement Benefit Plans Pension and other post-retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions. The Company assesses its pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, the Company considers many factors including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, the Company’s historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (see Note 6, “Retirement Plans and Other Post-retirement Benefits,” under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this 10-K, for additional information). Discount rates used for pension and other post-retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate at the measurement date of a high-quality fixed income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. In countries where debt instruments are thinly traded, estimates are based on available market rates. Actuarial assumptions are based upon management’s best estimates and judgment. An increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $21 million favorable impact on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost. An increase of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $8 million favorable impact on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost. 46 Table of Contents The expected rates of return for the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans represent the average rates of return to be earned on plan assets over the period during which the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company determines expected returns for each of the major asset classes, principally equities, fixed income and real estate. The return expectations for these asset classes are based on assumptions for economic growth and inflation, which are supported by long term historical data as well as the Company’s actual experience of return on plan assets. The expected portfolio performance also reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Expected returns are based primarily on a calculated market-related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from the Company’s expected returns for the majority of the assets are realized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. Total unrecognized net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other post-retirement benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. The targeted investment portfolio of the Company’s U.S. pension plan is allocated 65 percent to equities, 28 percent to fixed income investments and 7 percent to real estate. The targeted investment portfolio of the Company’s U.S. other post-retirement benefit plans is allocated 70 percent to equities and 30 percent to fixed income investments. The portfolios’ equity weightings are consistent with the long-term nature of the plans’ benefit obligations. For non-U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local governmental rules and regulations. Substantially all investments in equities and fixed income are valued based on quoted public market values. All investments in real estate are valued based on periodic appraisals. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis including insurance coverages. The Company reviews the status of all claims, investigations and legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. From time to time, the Company may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions management believes are in the best interests of the Company. Resolution of any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company has subsidiaries in more than 50 countries. In 2005, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 62 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, the Company’s reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula-based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of international operations using derivative financial instruments. Because the Company’s international subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover provides a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that the Company’s international operations are widespread. 47 Table of Contents In addition, at any point in time, the Company’s international subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short-term, third party and intercompany, receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect the translated value of these financial assets and liabilities. Gains or losses that arise from translation do not affect net income. On occasion, the Company has used derivatives to hedge specific short-term risk situations involving foreign currency exposures. However, these derivative transactions have not been material. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and/or equity prices are primarily cash equivalents, short-term investments and the debt and equity securities held in non-qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled $5.7 billion at December 31, 2005. For cash equivalents and short-term investments, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $15 million. For securities held in non-qualified trusts, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, the Company’s exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates are primarily short-term borrowings. The Company maintains an investment portfolio in excess of the amount of borrowings. Accordingly, the Company has mitigated its exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its financial obligations. The Company has long-term debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the debt by approximately $120 million. However, the Company does not expect to refund this debt.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of Schering-Plough Schering-Plough discovers, develops, manufactures and markets medical therapies and treatments to enhance human health. Schering-Plough also markets leading consumer brands in the over-the-counter (OTC), foot care and sun care markets and operates a global animal health business. There are two sources of new products: products acquired through acquisition and licensing arrangements, and products in Schering-Plough’s late-stage research pipeline. With respect to acquisitions and licensing, Schering-Plough has recently acquired some new product licenses. However, there are limited opportunities for obtaining or licensing critical late-stage products that will have a positive material financial impact. These limited opportunities typically require substantial amounts of funding. Schering-Plough often competes for these opportunities against companies with greater financial resources. Strategy — Focused on Science Earlier this decade, Schering-Plough experienced a number of business, regulatory, and legal challenges. In April 2003, the Board of Directors named Fred Hassan as the new Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Schering-Plough Corporation. With support from the Board, he recruited a new senior executive team and initiated a strategic plan, with the goal of stabilizing, repairing and turning around Schering-Plough in order to build long-term shareholder value. That strategic plan, the Action Agenda, is a six- to eight-year, five-phase plan. In October 2006, Schering-Plough announced that it entered the fourth phase of the Action Agenda — Build the Base. During the Build the Base phase, Schering-Plough continues to focus on its strategy of value creation across a broad front, including: • growing the business; • penetrating new markets; • expanding existing products; and • discovering and developing or acquiring new products. As part of this effort, Schering-Plough is enhancing infrastructure, upgrading processes and systems, and strengthening talent—both the recruitment of talented individuals and the development of key employees. While these efforts are companywide, Schering-Plough is focusing especially on research and development. A key component of the Action Agenda is applying science to meet unmet medical needs. Research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases. As a result, a core strategy of Schering-Plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments with important medical and commercial value. Consistent with this core strategy, Schering-Plough has been increasing its investment in research and development. Schering-Plough’s progressing pipeline includes drug candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas with 21 compounds now approaching or in Phase I development. As Schering-Plough continues to develop the later phase growth-drivers of the pipeline (e.g., thrombin receptor antagonist, golimumab, vicriviroc and HCV protease inhibitor), it anticipates higher spending on clinical trial activities. 2006 Results — Highlights of Schering-Plough’s performance in 2006 are as follows: • Schering-Plough’s net sales in 2006 were $10.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 11 percent, as compared to the 2005 period. Net Income Available to Common Shareholders in 2006 was $1.1 billion, as compared to $183 million in 2005. Cash flow from operating activities was $2.2 billion in 2006. • Global sales of Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, made by the cholesterol joint venture with Merck & Company, Inc. (Merck) continued to grow in 2006 and significantly contributed to Schering-Plough’s improved operating results and cash flow. In addition, increased sales of 28 Table of Contents pharmaceutical products such as REMICADE, NASONEX, TEMODAR, and CLARINEX also contributed favorably to Schering-Plough’s overall operating results and cash flow. • Schering-Plough gained approvals for new products and indications, including for the life-saving antifungal medicine NOXAFIL Oral Suspension in the United States and EU for the prevention of invasive fungal infections (NOXAFIL was discovered in Schering-Plough’s research laboratories); TEMODAL in Japan for the treatment of a form of brain cancer, malignant glioma; REMICADE in the EU for ulcerative colitis; and SUBOXONE Sublingual Tablets in the EU for opioid dependence. • Schering-Plough streamlined the global supply chain to yield expected annualized cost savings of about $100 million. • Schering-Plough reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle a previously disclosed investigation that related to actions that took place prior to 2003. The agreement provided for an aggregate settlement amount of $435 million. This settlement did not have a material adverse effect on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, financial condition or its business. Strategic Alliances As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, Schering-Plough licenses manufacturing, marketing and/or distribution rights to certain products to others, and also manufactures, markets and/or distributes products owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements. Any time that third parties are involved, there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of Schering-Plough that may create positive or negative impacts on Schering-Plough. VYTORIN, ZETIA and REMICADE are subject to such arrangements and are key to Schering-Plough’s current business and financial performance. In addition, any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements, which could result in VYTORIN and ZETIA being acquired by Merck or REMICADE reverting back to Centocor. The change in control provision relating to VYTORIN and ZETIA is included in the contract with Merck, filed as Exhibit 10(r) to Schering-Plough’s 10-K, and the change of control provision relating to REMICADE is contained in the contract with Centocor, filed as Exhibit 10(v) to Schering-Plough’s 10-K. Cholesterol Franchise Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, are managed through a joint venture between Schering-Plough and Merck for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels. ZETIA is Schering-Plough’s novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor, Merck’s statin medication. The financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with Merck, and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. The operating results of the joint venture with Merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting. A material change in the sales or market share of Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise would have a significant impact on Schering-Plough’s results of operations and cash flows. In order to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and business, Schering-Plough must continue to increase profits. This increased profitability is largely dependent upon the performance of Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise. The cholesterol-reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are competing in this market and, on a combined basis, these products continued to grow in terms of market share during 2006. As a franchise, the two products together have captured more than 15 percent of total prescriptions for the U.S. cholesterol management market (based on January 2007 IMS data). Japan is not included in the joint venture with Merck. In the Japanese market, Bayer Healthcare will co-market Schering-Plough’s cholesterol-absorption inhibitor, ZETIA, upon approval. Schering-Plough anticipates receiving this approval in Japan in 2007, but due to a backlog of new drug applications in Japan, Schering-Plough cannot precisely predict the timing of the approval. 29 Table of Contents License Arrangements with Centocor REMICADE is prescribed for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. REMICADE is Schering-Plough’s second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line (after the cholesterol franchise). REMICADE is licensed from and manufactured by Centocor, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company. Schering-Plough has the exclusive marketing rights to this product outside of the U.S., Japan and certain Asian markets. During 2005, Schering-Plough exercised an option under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab, a new TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, in the same territories as REMICADE. Golimumab is currently in Phase III trials. Schering-Plough and Centocor have been collaborating in resolving the difference in the parties’ opinions as to the expiration date of Schering-Plough’s rights to golimumab. In August 2006, Schering-Plough received a determination through arbitration that its rights to market golimumab will extend to 15 years after the first commercial sales in its territories, but Centocor has appealed the ruling. Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Schering-Plough supports commercialized products with manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. Schering-Plough is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business, including capital expenditures for the drug development process (where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets), information technology systems, and post-marketing studies and monitoring. Schering-Plough continually reviews the business, including manufacturing operations, to identify actions that will enhance long-term competitiveness. However, Schering-Plough’s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed, and actions to significantly reduce Schering-Plough’s manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. During 2006, Schering-Plough closed one manufacturing plant and took other streamlining actions. Schering-Plough continues to review the carrying value of manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments or related costs. Regulatory and Competitive Environment • Schering-Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. Regulatory compliance is complex and costly, impacting the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. • Since 2002, Schering-Plough has been working under a U.S. FDA Consent Decree to resolve issues involving Schering-Plough’s compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices at certain of its manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. Under the terms of the Decree, provided that the FDA has not notified Schering-Plough of a significant violation of FDA law, regulations, or the Decree in any five-year period since the Decree’s entry in May 2002, Schering-Plough may petition the court to have the Decree dissolved and FDA will not oppose Schering-Plough’s petition. There is no assurance about any particular date when the Consent Decree will be lifted. • Schering-Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU-member states. • Schering-Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. Research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., the EU, and local country regulatory authorities. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. • The pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering-Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. 30 Table of Contents • In the U.S., many of Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost-containment programs. • The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering-Plough’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, loss of patent protection due to challenges by competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering-Plough’s products mature. DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales A significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. In addition to these fluctuations, sales of many pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups, institutions, government agencies, and other groups seeking discounts. Schering-Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the U.S. market are also required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in the Medicaid program, the veterans’ health care program, and other government-funded programs. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment where governments may and have mandated cost-containment programs, placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods to control costs. Consolidated net sales in 2006 were $10.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion or 11 percent as compared to 2005. The increase primarily reflected the growth in sale volumes of REMICADE, NASONEX, PEG-INTRON and TEMODAR. This increase also reflected an unfavorable impact of 1 percent from foreign exchange. Consolidated net sales in 2005 totaled $9.5 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion or 15 percent compared to 2004, reflecting higher volumes of REMICADE, NASONEX, PEG-INTRON, TEMODAR and the inclusion of a full year of sales of AVELOX and CIPRO. In addition, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 1 percent. 31 Table of Contents Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 (Dollars in millions) PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS $ 8,561 $ 7,564 $ 6,417 13 % 18 % REMICADE 1,240 942 746 32 26 NASONEX 944 737 594 28 24 PEG-INTRON 837 751 563 11 33 CLARINEX/AERIUS 722 646 692 12 (7 ) TEMODAR 703 588 459 20 28 CLARITIN Rx 356 371 321 (4 ) 16 INTEGRILIN 329 315 325 5 (3 ) REBETOL 311 331 287 (6 ) 15 AVELOX 304 228 44 34 N/M INTRON A 237 287 318 (17 ) (10 ) CAELYX 206 181 150 13 21 SUBUTEX 203 197 185 3 6 ELOCON 141 144 168 (2 ) (14 ) CIPRO 111 146 43 (24 ) N/M Other Pharmaceutical 1,917 1,700 1,522 13 12 CONSUMER HEALTH CARE 1,123 1,093 1,085 3 1 OTC 558 556 578 N/M (4 ) Foot Care 343 333 331 3 1 Sun Care 222 204 176 9 16 ANIMAL HEALTH 910 851 770 7 11 CONSOLIDATED NET SALES $ 10,594 $ 9,508 $ 8,272 11 % 15 % N/M — Not a meaningful percentage. International net sales of REMICADE, a drug for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis, were up 32 percent to $1.2 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 26 percent in 2005 to $942 million as compared to 2004, due to greater demand, expanded indications and continued market growth. During 2006, competitive products for the indications referred to above have been introduced, and additional competitive products are expected to be introduced in 2007. Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once-daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 28 percent to $944 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 24 percent to $737 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, as the product captured greater U.S. and international market share in both 2006 and 2005. In 2005, U.S. sales benefited from an increased promotional effort and the introduction of a new scent-free, alcohol-free formulation of NASONEX nasal spray. A generic form of Flonase (fluticasone propionate) was approved early in 2006 and may unfavorably impact the corticosteroid nasal spray market going forward. Global net sales of PEG-INTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, increased 11 percent to $837 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 33 percent to $751 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. The sales increase in 2006 reflected higher sales volume in Japan and the U.S. Sales growth in 2005 was due to the December 2004 launch of the PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy in Japan. In Japan, sales in 2005 benefited from a significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEG-INTRON before beginning treatment. PEG-INTRON sales in Japan have begun to decline toward the end of 2006, 32 Table of Contents and this trend is expected to continue into 2007 as new patient enrollment for hepatitis C treatment moderates and new competition enters the Japanese market. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.), for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year-round indoor allergies, increased 12 percent to $722 million as compared to 2005 due to increased demand in Europe and Latin America as well as increased sales in the U.S. despite slightly declining market share. Global net sales of CLARINEX in 2005 decreased 7 percent to $646 million as compared to 2004 primarily due to reduced market share in a declining market in the U.S. Global net sales of TEMODAR Capsules, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased 20 percent to $703 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and increased 28 percent to $588 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increases in 2006 and 2005 sales were due to the increased utilization for new indications. In 2005, TEMODAR was approved by the U.S. FDA for treating newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is the most prevalent form of brain cancer, and by the European Commission for use in combination with radiotherapy for GBM patients in 25 EU-member states as well as in Iceland and Norway. In 2006, TEMODAR was approved in Japan for the treatment of malignant glioma. The growth rates for TEMODAR are expected to moderate, as significant market penetration has already been achieved in the treatment of GBM. International net sales of prescription CLARITIN decreased 4 percent to $356 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Sales in 2005 increased 16 percent to $371 million as compared to 2004 due to the launch of CLARITIN REDITABS in Japan coupled with an unusually severe Japanese allergy season during 2005. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering-Plough, increased 5 percent to $329 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. During 2005, sales decreased 3 percent to $315 million as compared to 2004. Effective September 1, 2005, Schering-Plough restructured its INTEGRILIN co-promotion agreement with Millennium. Under the terms of the restructured agreement, Schering-Plough acquired exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN in exchange for an upfront payment of $36 million and royalties on INTEGRILIN sales. The restructured agreement calls for minimum royalty payments of $85 million per year to Millennium in 2006 and 2007. Global 2006 net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with PEG-INTRON or INTRON A for treating hepatitis C, decreased 6 percent to $311 million as compared to 2005 due to lower sales in Europe and increased competition. Global net sales in 2005 increased 15 percent to $331 million as compared to 2004 due primarily to the launch of the PEG-INTRON and REBETOL combination therapy in Japan in December 2004. In Japan, sales in 2005 benefited from the significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEG-INTRON before beginning hepatitis C treatment. Sales are expected to continue to decline as a result of the moderation of hepatitis C patient enrollments in Japan and as new competition enters the Japanese market. Net sales of AVELOX, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering-Plough as a result of its license agreement with Bayer, increased 34 percent to $304 million in 2006 as compared to $228 million in 2005 due to share growth and new indications. Sales of AVELOX in 2004 represented the initial three months of sales under the agreement with Bayer, which was effective October 1, 2004. Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, decreased 17 percent to $237 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 10 percent in 2005 to $287 million as compared to 2004, due to the conversion to PEG-INTRON for treating hepatitis C in Japan. International net sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma, increased 13 percent to $206 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an expanding market for this product. Sales in 2005 increased 21 percent to $181 million as compared to 2004, reflecting further adoption of the ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer indications. International net sales of SUBUTEX Tablets, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 3 percent to $203 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to increased market share. Sales increased 6 percent to $197 million 33 Table of Contents in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increased market penetration. In October 2006, SUBOXONE was approved by the EU, including the 25 member states as well as Iceland and Norway, for the treatment of opioid dependence. Global net sales of ELOCON cream, a medium-potency topical steroid, decreased 2 percent to $141 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and decreased 14 percent to $144 million in 2005 as compared to 2004, reflecting generic competition that was introduced in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2005. Generic competition is expected to continue to adversely affect sales of this product. Net sales of CIPRO, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory, skin, urinary tract and other infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering-Plough as a result of its license agreement with Bayer, decreased 24 percent to $111 million in 2006 as compared to $146 million in 2005 due to market share erosion from generic competition. Sales of CIPRO in 2004 represented the initial three months of sales under the agreement with Bayer. Other pharmaceutical net sales include a large number of lower sales volume prescription pharmaceutical products. Several of these products are sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. These products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. Included in other pharmaceutical sales is sales of Schering-Plough’s albuterol products. In 2005, the FDA issued a Final Rule that requires all CFC albuterol products, including Schering-Plough’s PROVENTIL CFC, be removed from the market no later than December 31, 2008. Schering-Plough and other manufacturers of albuterol CFC have to transition to albuterol HFA (PROVENTIL HFA) prior to this 2008 year-end deadline. Schering-Plough has begun the transition to the HFA product. Schering-Plough is uncertain as to the ultimate impact on Schering-Plough’s overall future sales of PROVENTIL products, due to the complexities and multiple external factors influencing this transition, including competing albuterol HFA products. Global net sales of Consumer Health Care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased 3 percent or $30 million as compared to 2005 reflecting an increase in sales of sun care products and DR. SCHOLL’S and other foot care products. Sales were $1.1 billion in 2005 and 2004. Sales of OTC CLARITIN decreased 1 percent to $390 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 6 percent to $394 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of the restrictions on the retail sale of OTC products containing pseudoephedrine (PSE). In addition, OTC CLARITIN continues to face competition from private labels and branded loratadine. Net sales of sun care products increased $18 million or 9 percent in 2006 as compared to 2005, and $28 million or 16 percent in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily due to the success of new COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY products launched in 2005. Sales of sun care products in 2005 also reflected a stronger overall suncare season in the U.S. Future sales are difficult to predict because the consumer health care market is highly competitive, with heavy advertising to consumers and frequent competitive product introductions. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 7 percent to $910 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and 11 percent in 2005 to $851 million as compared to 2004, reflecting strong growth of core brands across most geographic and species areas led by higher sales of companion animal products in 2006 while the products serving the U.S. cattle market, including NUFLOR, and the vaccine business led sales growth in 2005. The increased net sales were also due in part to better product supply in the U.S. Schering-Plough expects this growth rate to moderate due to increased competition, including the introduction of generic products. 34 Table of Contents Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin 65.1 % 64.8 % 62.9 % 0.3 % 1.9 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) $ 4,718 $ 4,374 $ 3,811 7.9 % 14.8 % Research and development (R&D) 2,188 1,865 1,607 17.3 % 16.1 % Other (income)/expense, net (135 ) 5 146 N/M N/M Special charges 102 294 153 N/M N/M Equity income from cholesterol joint venture (1,459 ) (873 ) (347 ) N/M N/M N/M — Not a meaningful percentage Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in Schering-Plough’s net sales. The results of these sales are reflected in equity income from cholesterol joint venture. In addition, due to the virtual nature of the joint venture, Schering-Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative expenses that are not captured in equity income but are included in Schering-Plough’s Statements of Consolidated Operations. As a result, Schering-Plough’s gross margin, and ratios of SG&A expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the joint venture’s operating results. Gross margin Despite negative impacts on cost of sales from the costs resulting from Schering-Plough’s actions to streamline its manufacturing operations during 2006, gross margin increased to 65.1 percent in 2006 from 64.8 percent in 2005. This improvement in gross margin is primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products and process improvements within Schering-Plough’s supply chain, including cost savings from the manufacturing streamlining activities completed during 2006. In 2006, cost of sales included charges totaling $146 million associated with Schering-Plough’s actions to streamline its manufacturing operations, offset by savings of approximately $30 million as a result of these actions. See Note 2, “Special Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” for additional information. Gross margin increased to 64.8 percent in 2005 from 62.9 percent in 2004, primarily due to supply chain process improvements, increased sales of higher-margin products and a favorable impact from foreign exchange, partly offset by higher royalties related to the Bayer products and, beginning September 1, 2005, royalties for INTEGRILIN. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 8 percent to $4.7 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, reflecting ongoing investments in emerging markets and field support for product launches as well as higher promotional spending. SG&A expenses increased 15 percent to $4.4 billion in 2005 as compared to $3.8 billion in 2004. This increase was primarily due to the addition in the 2004 fourth quarter of Bayer sales representatives, increased selling expenses in Europe to support the continued launch of VYTORIN and ZETIA, and increased promotional spending, primarily for NASONEX, ASMANEX and the products under the agreement with Bayer. Research and development Research and development (R&D) spending increased 17 percent to $2.2 billion in 2006 as compared to the 2005 period. In 2005, R&D spending increased 16 percent to $1.9 billion as compared to the 2004 period. The 2006 increase was due to higher costs associated with clinical trials as well as building greater breadth and capacity to support Schering-Plough’s progressing pipeline. The 2005 increase is partially due to a $124 million charge in the third quarter of 2005 resulting from Schering-Plough’s exercise of its rights to develop and commercialize golimumab. R&D spending for 2004 included an $80 million charge in conjunction with the license from Toyama 35 Table of Contents Chemical Company Ltd. for garenoxacin. Generally, changes in R&D spending reflect the timing of Schering-Plough’s funding of both internal research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. To maximize Schering-Plough’s chances for the successful development of new products, Schering-Plough began a Development Excellence initiative in 2005 to build talent and critical mass, create a uniform level of excellence and deliver on high-priority programs within R&D. In 2006, Schering-Plough began a Global Clinical Harmonization Program to maximize and globalize the quality of clinical trial execution, pharmacovigilance and regulatory processes. Other (income)/expense, net Schering-Plough had other income, net, of $135 million in 2006 as compared to other expense, net, of $5 million and $146 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to higher interest rates on larger overall balances of cash equivalents and short-term investments. Special charges and Manufacturing Streamlining 2006 Manufacturing Streamlining During 2006, Schering-Plough implemented changes to its manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico and New Jersey to streamline its global supply chain and further enhance Schering-Plough’s long-term competitiveness. These changes resulted in the phase-out and closure of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations in Manati, Puerto Rico, and additional workforce reductions in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and New Jersey. In total, these actions have resulted in the elimination of over 1,000 positions. Schering-Plough expects these actions to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $100 million. Special Charges: Special charges in 2006 related to the changes in Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations totaled $102 million. These charges consisted of approximately $47 million of severance and $55 million of fixed asset impairments. Cost of Sales: Included in 2006 cost of sales was approximately $146 million consisting of $93 million of accelerated depreciation, $46 million of inventory write-offs, and $7 million of other charges related to the closure of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing facilities in Manati, Puerto Rico. The following table summarizes activities reflected in the consolidated financial statements related to changes to Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations which were completed in 2006: Charges included in Special Total Cash Non-Cash Accrued Cost of Sales Charges Charges Payments Charges Liability (Dollars in millions) Accrued liability at January 1, 2006 $ — Severance $ — $ 47 $ 47 $ (35 ) $ — 12 Asset impairments — 55 55 — (55 ) — Accelerated depreciation 93 — 93 — (93 ) — Inventory write-offs 46 — 46 — (46 ) — Other 7 — 7 (2 ) (5 ) — Total $ 146 $ 102 $ 248 $ (37 ) $ (199 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2006 $ 12 The accrued liability balance at December 31, 2006, is expected to be paid during the first quarter of 2007. Schering-Plough does not expect to incur any material additional charges related to the manufacturing streamlining actions announced in 2006. 36 Table of Contents 2004-2005 Special Charge Activities Special charges incurred in 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Litigation charges $ 250 $ — Employee termination costs 28 119 Asset impairment and other charges 16 34 $ 294 $ 153 Litigation charges: In 2005, litigation reserves were increased by $250 million. This increase resulted in a total reserve of $500 million for the Massachusetts Investigation, as well as the investigations and the state litigation disclosed under “AWP Litigation and Investigations” in Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” representing Schering-Plough’s then current estimate to resolve this matter. On August 29, 2006, Schering-Plough announced it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the Massachusetts Investigation for an aggregate amount of $435 million plus interest. This settlement amount relates only to the Massachusetts Investigation. The AWP investigations and litigation are ongoing. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, Schering-Plough made payments totaling $388 million related to this settlement including interest of $12 million. Substantially all the remaining payments under this settlement agreement will be paid in the remainder of 2007. See Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. Employee termination costs: In August 2003, Schering-Plough announced a global workforce reduction initiative. The first phase of this initiative was a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the U.S. Under this program, eligible employees in the U.S. had until December 15, 2003, to elect early retirement and receive an enhanced retirement benefit. Approximately 900 employees elected to retire under the program, all of which retired by December 31, 2005. The total cost of this program was approximately $191 million, comprised of increased pension costs of $108 million, increased post-retirement health care costs of $57 million, vacation payments of $4 million and costs related to accelerated vesting of stock grants of $22 million. Amounts recognized in 2005 and 2004 for this program were $7 million and $20 million, respectively. No additional amounts are expected to be recognized under this program. Termination costs not associated with the VERP totaled $21 million and $99 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to employee termination costs: Employee Termination Costs (Dollars in millions) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2003 $ 29 Special charges incurred during 2004 $ 119 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (20 ) Disbursements (110 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2004 $ 18 Special charges incurred during 2005 $ 28 Credit to retirement benefit plan liability (7 ) Disbursements (35 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2005 $ 4 Disbursements (4 ) Special charges liability balance at December 31, 2006 $ — 37 Table of Contents Asset impairment and other charges: For the year ended December 31, 2005, Schering-Plough recognized asset impairment and other charges of $16 million related primarily to the consolidation of Schering-Plough’s U.S. biotechnology organizations. Schering-Plough recorded asset impairment and other charges of $34 million in 2004, related primarily to the shutdown of a small European research and development facility. Equity Income from Cholesterol Joint Venture Global cholesterol franchise sales, which include sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA, made by the cholesterol joint venture with Merck and Schering-Plough totaled $3.9 billion, $2.4 billion, and $1.2 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The sales growth in 2006 was due to an increase in market share. The 2005 sales comparison benefited from the U.S. launch of VYTORIN in the second half of 2004. As a franchise, the two products combined have captured more than 15 percent of total prescriptions in the U.S. cholesterol management market (based on January 2007 IMS data). Schering-Plough utilizes the equity method of accounting for the joint venture. Sharing of income from operations is based upon percentages that vary by product, sales level and country. Schering-Plough’s allocation of joint venture income is increased by milestones earned. Merck and Schering-Plough (the Partners) bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the cholesterol agreements provide for a reimbursement to each Partner for physician details that are set on annual basis, and in Italy, a contractual amount is included in the profit sharing calculation that is not reimbursed. These amounts are equal to each Partner’s physician details multiplied by a contractual fixed fee. Schering-Plough reports these amounts as part of equity income from the cholesterol joint venture. These amounts do not represent specific, incremental and identifiable costs for Schering-Plough’s detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, these amounts are not reflective of Schering-Plough’s sales effort related to the joint venture, as Schering-Plough’s sales force and related costs associated with the joint venture are generally estimated to be higher. Costs of the joint venture that the Partners contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct-to-consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out-of-pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by the Partners. Additional information regarding the joint venture with Merck is also included in Note 3, “Equity Income from Cholesterol Joint Venture,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Equity income from cholesterol joint venture totaled $1.5 billion, $873 million and $347 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 equity income as compared to 2005 reflecting continued strong sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA. The 2005 equity income comparison benefited from the U.S. launch of VYTORIN in the second half of 2004. During 2005 and 2004, Schering-Plough recognized milestones from Merck of $20 million and $7 million, respectively. The $20 million milestone in 2005 related to certain European approvals of VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) in 2005. The $7 million milestone in 2004 related to the approval of ezetimibe/simvastatin in Mexico in 2004. Under certain other conditions, as specified in the joint venture agreements with Merck, Schering-Plough could earn additional milestones totaling $105 million. It should be noted that Schering-Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative and other costs, which are not reflected in equity income from the cholesterol joint venture and instead are included in the overall cost structure of Schering-Plough. Provision for Income Taxes Tax expense was $362 million, $228 million and $779 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The tax provisions in 2006, 2005 and 2004 do not include any benefit related to U.S. operating losses. During 2004, Schering-Plough established a valuation allowance on its net U.S. deferred tax assets, including the benefit of U.S. operating losses, as management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the benefit of the U.S. net deferred tax assets can be realized. At December 31, 2006, Schering-Plough continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its 38 Table of Contents U.S. deferred tax assets. Schering-Plough expects to report a U.S. Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward of $1.54 billion on its tax return for the year ended December 31, 2006. This U.S. NOL carryforward could be materially reduced after examination of Schering-Plough’s income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 2006, Schering-Plough generated approximately $600 million in U.S. operating losses; however, due to differences between financial and tax reporting, the expected NOL to be generated on the 2006 U.S. tax return will be less than the U.S. operating loss for the year. Schering-Plough expects to continue to generate U.S. operating losses in 2007; however, the U.S. NOL will be subject to differences between financial and tax reporting. The 2006 and 2005 income tax provision primarily relates to foreign taxes. The 2005 tax provision includes a benefit of $46 million related to an IRS Notice issued in August 2005, which resulted in a reduction of the previously accrued tax liability attributable to repatriations under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The 2004 tax provision includes a $417 million charge related to the intended AJCA repatriation that took place in 2005. The IRS is examining Schering-Plough’s 1997-2002 federal income tax returns and is in the process of completing that examination. Schering-Plough anticipates that the examination will be completed before the end of 2007. The finalization of this IRS audit may result in adjustments to Schering-Plough’s accruals for tax contingencies and the U.S. NOLs as reported on Schering-Plough’s income tax returns. Schering-Plough’s tax reserves reflect its best estimate of the probable tax liability; however, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of these tax matters may be materially greater or less than the amount accrued. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Schering-Plough is required to apply the provisions of this interpretation beginning on January 1, 2007. The provisions of FIN 48 will be applied to all existing uncertain income tax positions on the effective date. Upon the implementation of FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this Interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of Schering-Plough’s retained earnings in 2007. Although Schering-Plough is still evaluating the potential impact of FIN 48, it expects a decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, from $225 million to $300 million with a corresponding increase to the appropriate tax liability accounts upon the adoption of this Interpretation. Net Income/(Loss) Available to Common Shareholders Schering-Plough had net income/(loss) available to common shareholders of $1.1 billion, $183 million and $(981) million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net income available to common shareholders for 2006 and 2005 included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $86 million, in each period, related to the issuance of the 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in August 2004. The 2004 net loss available to common shareholders included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $34 million. Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders for 2006, 2005 and 2004 also included special charges and manufacturing streamlining costs of approximately $248 million, $294 million and $153 million, respectively. See Note 2, “Special Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. In addition, 2006 net income available to common shareholders included an income item of $22 million resulting from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax, related to the implementation of SFAS 123R, “Share-Based Compensation.” LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Cash flow from operating activities $ 2,161 $ 882 $ (154 ) Cash flow from investing activities (2,908 ) (454 ) (621 ) Cash flow from financing activities (1,361 ) (633 ) 1,534 39 Table of Contents Operating Activities In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion as compared to 2005. The increase primarily resulted from higher net income and the timing of operating cash payments and receipts. As disclosed in Note 19, “Legal, Environment and Regulatory Matters,” Schering-Plough has reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the Massachusetts Investigation for an aggregate amount of $435 million plus interest. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, Schering-Plough made payments totaling $388 million related to this settlement, including interest of $12 million. Substantially all the remaining payments under this settlement agreement will be paid in the remainder of 2007. In 2005, operating activities generated $882 million of cash, compared with a use of $154 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher net income and timing of payments of special charges related to litigation, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to sales growth; payments of approximately $375 million to tax authorities for tax liabilities related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA; and tax payments of $239 million related to the settlement of certain tax contingencies for the tax years 1993 through 1996. Tax charges related to the AJCA were expensed in 2004. In 2004, operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a U.S. tax refund of $404 million as a result of loss carryback. However, cash flow was unfavorably impacted by a $473 million payment to the U.S. government for a tax deficiency related to certain transactions in tax years 1991 to 1992 and the payment of $294 million under the settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during 2006 was $2.9 billion primarily related to the net purchases of short-term investments of $2.4 billion previously invested in cash equivalents and $458 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities during 2005 was $454 million, primarily related to $478 million of capital expenditures and the purchase of intangible assets of $51 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $43 million and the net reduction in short-term investments of $33 million. Net cash used for investing activities in 2004 was $621 million and included capital expenditures of $489 million and net purchases of investments of $264 million, partially offset by cash proceeds of $118 million from the transfer of license rights and $7 million from the dispositions of property and equipment. Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities during 2006 and 2005 was $1.4 billion and $633 million, respectively. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2006 and 2005 include the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $412 million and $410 million, respectively; the repayment of $1.0 billion of bank debt and short-term commercial borrowings in 2006, and $1.2 billion of short-term commercial paper borrowings in 2005. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2005 was partially offset by proceeds of $900 million from bank debt incurred by a foreign subsidiary related to funding of a portion of the repatriations under the AJCA during 2005. This bank debt was fully repaid in 2006. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 reflected proceeds of $1.4 billion from the preferred stock issuance and $546 million from the increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $354 million. Other Discussion of Cash Flows Schering-Plough is moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business and currently is in the process of building a U.S. pharmaceutical sciences center in New Jersey. Capital expenditures of approximately $38 million were made in 2006 related to this center. Additional capital expenditures of approximately $260 million are expected over the next three years. This center will allow Schering-Plough to streamline and integrate its drug development process, where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to market. There will be additional related expenditures to upgrade equipment and staffing for this center. 40 Table of Contents In 2006, U.S. operations generated negative cash flow. U.S. operations have cash needs in excess of cash generated in the U.S. The U.S. operations must fund dividend payments, the majority of research and development costs and U.S. capital expenditures. It is expected that the U.S. operation will also generate negative cash flow in 2007. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments less total debt was approximately $3.3 billion at December 31, 2006. Cash generated from operations and available cash and short-term investments are expected to provide Schering-Plough with the ability to fund cash needs for the intermediate term. 6 Percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock In August 2004, Schering-Plough issued 6 percent mandatory convertible preferred stock and received net proceeds of $1.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. The proceeds were used to reduce short-term commercial paper borrowings, pay tax and litigation settlement amounts and litigation costs, and to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures. The preferred stock was issued under Schering-Plough’s $2.0 billion shelf registration, and each preferred share will automatically convert into between 2.2451 and 2.7840 common shares of Schering-Plough depending on the average closing price of Schering-Plough’s common shares over a period immediately preceding the mandatory conversion date of September 14, 2007, as defined in the prospectus. See Note 15, “Shareholders’ Equity,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. The conversion of these preferred shares will not trigger any cash payment by Schering-Plough. At December 31, 2006, $563 million remains registered and un-issued under the shelf registration. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On November 26, 2003, Schering-Plough issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. Proceeds from this offering of $2.4 billion were used for general corporate purposes, including repaying commercial paper outstanding in the U.S. Upon issuance, the notes were rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and A+ (on Credit Watch with negative implications) by Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moody’s or S&P is downgraded below A3 or A-, respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 13, “Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Other Commitments,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. On July 14, 2004, Moody’s lowered its rating on the notes to Baa1. Accordingly, the interest payable on each note increased 25 basis points effective December 1, 2004. Therefore, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3 percent to 5.55 percent, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent. This adjustment to the interest rate payable on the notes increased Schering-Plough’s interest expense by approximately $6 million annually. The interest rate payable on a particular series of notes will return to 5.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, and the rate adjustment provisions will permanently cease to apply if, following a downgrade by either Moody’s or S&P below A3 or A-, respectively, the notes are subsequently rated above Baa1 by Moody’s and BBB+ by S&P. Schering-Plough has a $1.5 billion credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This facility matures in May 2009 and requires Schering-Plough to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio of no more than 60 percent, which was met at December 31, 2006. This credit line is available for general corporate purposes and is considered as support to Schering-Plough’s commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under this credit facility may be drawn by the U.S. parent company or by its wholly-owned international subsidiaries when accompanied by a parent guarantee. This facility does not require compensating balances; however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. As of December 31, 2005, $325 million was drawn under this facility by a wholly-owned international subsidiary for the purposes of funding repatriations under the AJCA. During 2006, this borrowing amount was fully repaid. As of December 31, 2006, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. In addition to the above credit facility, Schering-Plough entered into a $575 million credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2005 for the purposes of funding repatriations under the AJCA. As of December 31, 2005, the entire amount was drawn by a wholly-owned international subsidiary to fund the repatriations. This facility was paid in full and terminated in 2006. 41 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, short-term borrowings, including the credit facilities mentioned above, totaled $242 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, including outstanding commercial paper of $149 million and $298 million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate for short-term borrowings at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 6.4 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. Credit Ratings Schering-Plough’s current unsecured senior credit ratings and outlook are as follows: Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings Long-term Short-term Outlook Moody’s Investors Service Baa1 P-2 Positive Standard and Poor’s A- A-2 Stable Fitch Ratings A- F-2 Stable The short-term ratings discussed above have not significantly affected Schering-Plough’s ability to issue or roll over its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, Schering-Plough believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as Schering-Plough, with one or more short-term credit ratings of P-2 from Moody’s, A-2 from S&P and/or F-2 from Fitch to issue or roll over outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short-term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to these issuers is typically less than that of higher-rated companies. Schering-Plough’s sizable lines of credit with commercial banks as well as cash and short-term investments held by U.S. and international subsidiaries serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. Schering-Plough’s credit ratings could decline below their current levels. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on Schering-Plough’s short and long-term debt. As discussed above, Schering-Plough believes that existing cash, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will allow Schering-Plough to fund its cash needs for the intermediate term. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Schering-Plough has various contractual obligations that are reported as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and others that are not required to be recognized as liabilities such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts. The following table summarizes payments due by period under Schering-Plough’s known contractual obligations at December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period Less More Than Than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 242 $ 242 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt obligations(1) 2,414 2 3 2 2,407 Operating lease obligations 264 85 106 38 35 Purchase obligations: Advertising contracts 117 117 — — — Research contracts(2) 141 126 9 4 2 Capital expenditure commitments 181 179 2 — — Other purchase obligations(3) 1,643 1,562 55 19 7 Deferred compensation plan obligations 85 14 11 18 42 Other obligations(4) 391 247 19 16 109 Total $ 5,478 $ 2,574 $ 205 $ 97 $ 2,602 (1) Long-term debt obligations include the $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.55 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2013 and $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75 percent senior, unsecured notes due 2033 and excludes interest obligations. See Note 13, “Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and 42 Table of Contents Other Commitments,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. (2) Research contracts do not include any potential milestone payments to be made since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by Schering-Plough without penalty. (3) Other purchase obligations consist of both cancelable and non-cancelable inventory and expense items. (4) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of Schering-Plough’s pension plans, preferred stock dividends and other contractual obligations. REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SCHERING-PLOUGH OPERATES Schering-Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. These regulations are described in more detail in Item 1, “Business.” Regulatory compliance is complex, as regulatory standards (including Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices) vary by jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. Regulatory compliance is also costly. Regulatory compliance also impacts the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Further, failure to comply with regulations can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recall of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Regulatory compliance, and the cost of compliance failures, can have a material impact on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, its cash flows or financial condition. Much is still unknown about the science of human health and with every drug there are benefits and risks that may be balanced. Societal and government pressures are constantly shifting between the demand for innovation to meet urgent unmet medical needs and adversity to risk. These pressures impact the regulatory environment and the market for Schering-Plough’s products. Regulatory Compliance and Pharmacovigilance Consent Decree Since 2002, Schering-Plough has been working under a U.S. FDA Consent Decree to resolve issues involving Schering-Plough’s compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at certain of its manufacturing sites in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. See details in Note 18, “Consent Decree” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Under the terms of the Consent Decree, Schering-Plough made payments totaling $500 million. As of the end of 2005, Schering-Plough has completed the revalidation programs for bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug products, as well as all 212 Significant Steps of the cGMP Work Plan, in accordance with the schedules required by the Consent Decree. Schering-Plough has obtained third-party expert certification of completion of the cGMP Work Plan as required by the Decree. This certification is in turn subject to acceptance by the FDA. Under the terms of the Decree, provided that the FDA has not notified Schering-Plough of a significant violation of FDA law, regulations, or the Decree in any five-year period since the Decree’s entry in May of 2002, Schering-Plough may petition the court to have the Decree dissolved and the FDA will not oppose Schering-Plough’s petition. There is no assurance about any particular date when the Consent Decree will be lifted. Regulatory Inspections Schering-Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU-member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug in order to alert the drug’s manufacturer and the governmental agency to potential problems. 43 Table of Contents During 2003, pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) cited serious deficiencies in reporting processes. Schering-Plough has continued to work on its long-term action plan to rectify the deficiencies and has provided regular updates to the EMEA. During the fourth quarter 2005, local UK and EMEA regulatory authorities conducted a follow up inspection to assess Schering-Plough’s implementation of its action plan. In the first quarter of 2006, these authorities also inspected the U.S.-based components of Schering-Plough’s pharmacovigilance system. The inspectors acknowledged that progress had been made since 2003, but also continued to note significant concerns with the quality systems supporting Schering-Plough’s pharmacovigilance processes. Similarly, in a follow up inspection of Schering-Plough’s clinical trial practices in the UK, inspectors identified issues with respect to Schering-Plough’s management of clinical trials and related pharmacovigilance practices. Schering-Plough intends to continue upgrading skills, processes and systems in clinical practices and pharmacovigilance. Schering-Plough remains committed to accomplish this work and to invest significant resources in this area. Further, in February 2006, Schering-Plough began the Global Clinical Harmonization Program for building clinical excellence (in trial design, execution and tracking), which will strengthen Schering-Plough’s scientific and compliance rigor on a global basis. Schering-Plough does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to the inspections. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against Schering-Plough and/or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering-Plough’s products. Regulatory Compliance and Post-Marketing Surveillance Schering-Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. These clinical trial research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., EU, and local country regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with current Good Clinical Practices, other applicable laws or regulations or quality processes can result in delays in approval of clinical trials, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, delays in approval of marketing authorizations, criminal sanctions against Schering-Plough and/or responsible individuals, changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering-Plough’s products and increased costs. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. Schering-Plough’s personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. Following this wake of recent product withdrawals by other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMEA and the PMDA in Japan have continued to increase their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re-reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the U.S., on advertising and promotion and in particular, direct-to-consumer advertising. Similarly, major health authorities, including the FDA, EMEA and PMDA, have also increased collaboration amongst themselves, especially with regard to the evaluation of safety and benefit/risk information. Media attention has also increased. In the current environment, a health authority regulatory action in one market, such as a safety labeling change, may have regulatory, prescribing and marketing implications in other markets to an extent not previously seen. Some health authorities, such as the PMDA, have publicly acknowledged a significant backlog in workload due to resource constraints within their agency. This backlog has caused long regulatory review times for new indications and products, including the initial approval of ZETIA in Japan, and has added to the uncertainty in 44 Table of Contents predicting approval timelines in these markets. While the PMDA has committed to correcting the backlog and has made some progress over the last year, it is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. These and other uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect Schering-Plough’s operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. Schering-Plough has nevertheless achieved a significant number of important regulatory approvals since 2004, including approvals for VYTORIN, CLARINEX D-24, CLARINEX REDITABS, CLARINEX D-12 and new indications for TEMODAR and NASONEX. Other significant approvals since 2004 include ASMANEX DPI (Dry Powder for Inhalation) in the U.S.; NOXAFIL in the U.S., the EU and Australia; PEG-INTRON in Japan; and new indications for REMICADE. Schering-Plough also has a number of significant regulatory submissions filed in major markets awaiting approval. Pricing Pressures As described more specifically in Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering-Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorney’s Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti-kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject Schering-Plough to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. Schering-Plough also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business. In the U.S., many of Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In the U.S. market, Schering-Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans’ health care program and other government-funded programs. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost-containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements; emphasized greater use of generic drugs; and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods to control costs. Since Schering-Plough is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. Medicare Schering-Plough cannot predict what net effect the Medicare prescription drug benefit will have on markets and sales. The new Medicare Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D), which took effect January 1, 2006, offers voluntary prescription drug coverage, subsidized by Medicare, to more than 40 million Medicare beneficiaries through competing private prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Many of Schering-Plough’s leading drugs are already covered under Medicare Part B (e.g., TEMODAR, INTEGRILIN and INTRON 45 Table of Contents A). Medicare Part B provides payment for physician services that can include prescription drugs administered along with other physician services. The manner in which drugs are reimbursed under Medicare Part B may limit Schering-Plough’s ability to offer larger price concessions or make large price increases on these drugs. Other Schering-Plough drugs have a relatively small portion of their sales to the Medicare population (e.g., CLARINEX, the hepatitis C franchise). Schering-Plough could experience expanded utilization of VYTORIN and ZETIA and new drugs in Schering-Plough’s R&D pipeline. Of greater consequence for Schering-Plough may be the legislation’s impact on pricing, rebates and discounts. Competition The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering-Plough’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering-Plough’s products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. 2007 OUTLOOK Schering-Plough is on track with the actions to build long-term high performance in the Build the Base phase of the Action Agenda. Schering-Plough will continue to make investments to support its geographical expansion strategy and plans to make sound promotional investments to continue driving the growth of key brands worldwide. Schering-Plough remains focused on controlling its overhead spending and maintaining a right-sized sales force for its current opportunities in the U.S. Schering-Plough currently does not provide numeric guidance. However, the following outlook may be helpful to readers in assessing future prospects: Currently, the U.S. cholesterol lowering market is adjusting to the entry into the market of multiple generic forms of competing cholesterol products. Despite the introduction of new innovative competing treatments and generic versions of competing products, Schering-Plough continues to anticipate that sales from VYTORIN and ZETIA will grow in 2007. The decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and reimbursement policies could negatively impact the dollar size and/or growth of the cholesterol management market, including VYTORIN and ZETIA. As Schering-Plough’s pipeline continues to progress, it expects that the number of patients in Schering-Plough’s clinical trials will increase substantially in 2007. Schering-Plough also will continue to invest in research and development with a focus on enhancing infrastructure and upgrading processes, systems and talent. As a result, Schering-Plough expects R&D expenses, excluding any upfront payments, will grow faster than adjusted net sales in 2007. Adjusted net sales is defined as net sales plus an assumed 50 percent of global cholesterol joint venture net sales. Schering-Plough believes that this growth comparison provides a useful guideline to review our outlook for R&D expenses. As a result of Schering-Plough’s actions to streamline its manufacturing operations, Schering-Plough expects annualized cost savings of approximately $100 million in 2007, and gross margin should improve accordingly. The risks described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” could cause actual results to differ from the expectations provided in this section. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which is effective for calendar-year companies on January 1, 2008. The Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Statement codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The 46 Table of Contents standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Schering-Plough is currently assessing the potential impacts of implementing this standard. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 1N (SAB 108), “Financial Statements — Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,” which is effective for calendar-year companies as of December 31, 2006. SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the financial statements are materially misstated. Under this guidance, companies should take into account both the effect of a misstatement on the current year balance sheet as well as the impact upon the current year income statement in assessing the materiality of a current year misstatement. Once a current year misstatement has been quantified, the guidance in SAB Topic 1M, “Financial Statements — Materiality,” (SAB 99) should be applied to determine whether the misstatement is material. The implementation of SAB 108 did not have any impact on Schering-Plough’s financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Schering-Plough is required to apply the provisions of this interpretation beginning on January 1, 2007. The provisions of FIN 48 will be applied to all existing uncertain income tax positions on the effective date. Upon the implementation of FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this Interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Although Schering-Plough is still evaluating the potential impact of FIN 48, upon the adoption of FIN 48, it expects a decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 from $225 million to $300 million with a corresponding increase to other accrued liability accounts upon the adoption of this Interpretation. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and estimates are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect Schering-Plough’s financial statements: • Revenue Recognition • Rebates, Discounts and Returns • Provision for Income Taxes • Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property • Accounting for Pensions and Post-retirement Benefit Plans • Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers, which include wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations. Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies, other indirect purchasers and other market participants such as managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers. Schering-Plough recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain federal and state governmental programs; and iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. 47 Table of Contents When recognizing revenue, Schering-Plough estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made, Schering-Plough defers the recognition of revenue. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re-evaluated as part of this process. Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, Schering-Plough would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with wholesalers, managed-care organizations and government purchasers, and certain other market conditions. Rebates are estimated based on sales and contract terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Schering-Plough evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of third-party demand and market research data as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition including expected generic introductions, or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of return reserves. Schering-Plough’s agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers address a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of these agreements, Schering-Plough expects to avoid situations where Schering-Plough’s shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Schering-Plough’s rebate accruals for Federal and State governmental programs, including Medicaid and Medicare Part D, at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $115 million and $144 million, respectively. Commercial discounts, returns and other rebate accruals in the U.S. at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $371 million and $378 million, respectively. These accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of liabilities, which are included in total current liabilities, or in the case of returns and other receivable adjustments, an allowance provided against accounts receivable. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, Schering-Plough’s payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy Schering-Plough’s obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 19, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. 48 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 522 $ 537 Provision for Rebates 474 479 Adjustment to prior-year estimates(1) (56 ) — Payments (460 ) (495 ) (42 ) (16 ) Provision for Returns 124 116 Adjustment to prior-year estimates (8 ) — Returns (121 ) (167 ) (5 ) (51 ) Provision for Discounts 605 459 Adjustment to prior-year estimates (6 ) — Discounts granted (588 ) (407 ) 11 52 Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, End of Period $ 486 $ 522 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2006, the adjustment to prior-year estimates for rebates includes $24 million resulting from the reversal of the accrued rebate amounts recorded in 2005 and 2004 for the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program that in August 2006, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals ruled pharmaceutical manufacturers are not obligated to pay. In formulating and recording the above accruals, management utilizes assumptions and estimates that include historical experience, wholesaler data, the projection of market conditions, the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate, utilization estimates, and forecasted product demand amounts as discussed under the critical accounting policy entitled “Revenue Recognition.” As part of its review of these accruals, management performs a sensitivity analysis that considers differing assumptions, which are most subject to judgment in its rebate accrual calculation. Based upon Schering-Plough’s sensitivity analysis, reasonably possible changes to assumptions related to rebate accruals for Federal and State governmental programs could favorably or unfavorably impact net sales and income before taxes by approximately $20 million for 2006. Provision for Income Taxes As of December 31, 2006, taxes have not been provided on approximately $4.2 billion of earnings of international subsidiaries as Schering-Plough considers these earnings indefinitely reinvested in its international subsidiaries. Schering-Plough believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years, based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities. Schering-Plough accrues liabilities for identified tax contingencies that result from tax positions taken that could be challenged by tax authorities. Schering-Plough’s tax reserves reflect Schering-Plough’s best estimate of the probable tax liability, however, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may be materially greater or less than the amount accrued. Schering-Plough will adopt FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” on January 1, 2007. See “Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards” as discussed above for additional 49 Table of Contents information regarding the expected impacts on Schering-Plough’s financial statements from the implementation of FIN 48. Schering-Plough’s potential tax exposures result from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property). Although Schering-Plough’s cross border arrangements between affiliates are based upon internationally accepted standards, tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their country. Schering-Plough records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Schering-Plough has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event Schering-Plough were to determine that it would be able to realize all or an additional portion of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should Schering-Plough subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or an additional portion of its remaining net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Intangible Assets and Property Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $492 million at December 31, 2006. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $45 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2006. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. Certain of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing sites operate below capacity. Overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased due to the Consent Decree and other compliance activities. Schering-Plough’s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to significantly reduce Schering-Plough’s manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments and/or related costs. Accounting for Pension and Post-retirement Benefit Plans Pension and other post-retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions. Schering-Plough assesses its pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, Schering-Plough considers many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, Schering-Plough’s historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations. See Note 7, “Retirement Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. Discount rates used for pension and other post-retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high-quality fixed income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. In countries where debt instruments are thinly traded, estimates are based on available market rates. 50 Table of Contents Actuarial assumptions are based upon management’s best estimates and judgment. With other assumptions held constant, an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated favorable impact of $23 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost and an increase of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated favorable impact of $8 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost. With other assumptions held constant, a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $33 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost and a decreased of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $8 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost. The expected rates of return for the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans represent the average rates of return to be earned on plan assets over the period during which the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Schering-Plough determines expected returns for each of the major asset classes, principally equities, fixed income and real estate. The return expectations for these asset classes are based on assumptions for economic growth and inflation, which are supported by long-term historical data as well as Schering-Plough’s actual experience of return on plan assets. The expected portfolio performance also reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Expected returns are based primarily on a calculated market-related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from Schering-Plough’s expected returns for the majority of the assets are realized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. Total unrecognized net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other post-retirement benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering-Plough’s U.S. pension plan is allocated 65 percent to equities; 28 percent to fixed income investments; and 7 percent to real estate. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering-Plough’s U.S. other post-retirement benefit plans is allocated 70 percent to equities and 30 percent to fixed income investments. The portfolios’ equity weightings are consistent with the long-term nature of the plans’ benefit obligations. For non-U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local governmental rules and regulations. Substantially all investments in equities and fixed income are valued based on quoted public market values. All investments in real estate are valued based on periodic appraisals. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,” an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R. Effective December 31, 2006, Schering-Plough accounts for its retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158. Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2006, was reduced by approximately 7 percent upon the adoption of SFAS No. 158. See Note 7, “Retirement Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” for additional information. SFAS No. 158 allows an extended adoption date for year-end measurement date requirement as allowed under this Statement. Currently, a majority of Schering-Plough’s retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans’ assets and liabilities are measured at December 31. For the remaining plans, which have measurement dates other then year-end, Schering-Plough anticipates adopting the year-end measurement date effective on December 31, 2007. Schering-Plough does not expect any material impact on its financial statements upon the adoption. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis including insurance coverages. Schering-Plough reviews the status of all claims, investigations and legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. From time to time, Schering-Plough may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions management believes are in the best interests of Schering-Plough. Resolution of 51 Table of Contents any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE Schering-Plough is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Schering-Plough has subsidiaries in more than 50 countries. In 2006, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 60 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, Schering-Plough’s reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula-based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of international operations using derivative financial instruments. Because Schering-Plough’s international subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover can provide a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that Schering-Plough’s international operations are widespread. In addition, at any point in time, Schering-Plough’s international subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short-term, third-party and intercompany receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect the translated value of these financial assets and liabilities. Gains or losses that arise from translation do not affect net income. On occasion, Schering-Plough has used derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures. However, these derivative transactions have not been material. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and/or equity prices are primarily cash equivalents, short-term investments and the debt and equity securities held in non-qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled more than $6 billion at December 31, 2006. For cash equivalents and short-term investments, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $25 million. For securities held in non-qualified trusts, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, Schering-Plough’s exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates are primarily short-term borrowings. Schering-Plough currently maintains an investment portfolio of short-term investment instruments in excess of the amount of borrowings. Accordingly, Schering-Plough has mitigated its exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its financial obligations. Schering-Plough has long-term debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the debt by approximately $115 million. However, Schering-Plough does not currently expect to refund this debt.

310158,MRK,"Merck & Co., Inc.",2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of Schering-Plough Schering-Plough is an innovation-driven science-centered global health care company. Schering-Plough discovers, develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals for three customer markets — human prescription, animal health, and consumer. While most of the research and development activity is directed toward prescription products, there are important applications of this central research and development platform into the animal health products and the consumer health care products. Schering-Plough also accesses external innovation via partnering, in-licensing and acquisition for all three customer markets. Strategy — Focused on Science Earlier this decade, Schering-Plough experienced a number of business, regulatory, and legal challenges. In April 2003, the Board of Directors named Fred Hassan as the new Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Schering-Plough Corporation. With support from the Board, he initiated a strategic plan, with the goal of stabilizing, repairing and turning around Schering-Plough in order to build long-term shareholder value. He also installed a new senior executive team. That strategic plan, the Action Agenda, is a six- to eight-year, five-phase plan. Schering-Plough is currently in the fourth phase of the Action Agenda — Build the Base. During the Build the Base phase, Schering-Plough continues to focus on its strategy of value creation across a broad front, and believes the Organon BioSciences N.V. (OBS) acquisition was a major, transformative accomplishment in this regard. The OBS acquisition added further diversification of marketed products, including two new therapeutic areas (Women’s Health and Central Nervous System), as well as significant strength in Animal Health products and pipeline. Other accomplishments in 2007 include: • growing the business, for example there was double digit sales growth in all three product groups, Human Pharmaceuticals, Animal Health and Consumer Health Care; • penetrating new markets, including China, Brazil and Russia; • expanding the product portfolio for Schering-Plough’s three customer groups — human pharmaceutical, animal health and consumer health care; and • discovering and developing or acquiring new products. A key component of the Action Agenda is applying science to meet unmet medical needs. Research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases. As a result, a core strategy of Schering-Plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments that address important unmet medical needs and also have commercial value. Schering-Plough has been successful in advancing its pipeline into several late-stage projects that will require sizable resources to complete. Consistent with this core strategy, Schering-Plough is increasing its investment in research and development. As Schering-Plough continues to develop the later phase growth-drivers of the pipeline (e.g., sugammadex, thrombin receptor antagonist, golimumab, vicriviroc, boceprevir and asenapine), it anticipates higher spending on clinical trial activities. Schering-Plough’s progressing early pipeline includes drug candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas with more than 20 compounds now approaching or in Phase I development. As part of the Action Agenda, Schering-Plough continues to work to enhance infrastructure, upgrade processes and systems and strengthen talent — both the recruitment of talented individuals and the development of key employees. While these efforts are being implemented on a companywide basis, Schering-Plough is focusing especially on research and development to support Schering-Plough’s science-based business. 31 Table of Contents Further, with the integration of the OBS employees into Schering-Plough much new talent has been added. In addition, as part of the integration of OBS, Schering-Plough has also announced that there will be some workforce reduction to eliminate redundancies. 2007 Results — Highlights of Schering-Plough’s performance in 2007 are as follows: • Closed the acquisition of OBS on November 19, 2007 for a purchase price of approximately Euro 11 billion. • Schering-Plough’s net sales in 2007 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion, or 20 percent, as compared to the 2006 period. 2007 net sales included $626 million of sales of products acquired as part of the OBS acquisition. • Net loss available to common shareholders in 2007 was $1.6 billion, as compared to net income available to common shareholders of $1.1 billion in 2006. Included in the 2007 net loss is approximately $4.0 billion of charges related to purchase accounting for the OBS acquisition, including a $3.8 billion acquired in-process research and development charge. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion in 2007. • Global sales of Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, made by the cholesterol joint venture with Merck & Company, Inc. (Merck) continued to grow in 2007 and contributed significantly to Schering-Plough’s improved operating results and cash flow (see note below about 2008 developments). In addition, increased sales of pharmaceutical products such as REMICADE, TEMODAR and NASONEX also contributed favorably to Schering-Plough’s overall operating results and cash flow. The additional strength that Schering-Plough developed, in 2007 and during the four years since Mr. Hassan and the new management team began the Action Agenda, is key for Schering-Plough in the current environment. The pharmaceutical industry continues to be subject to ever-more critical scrutiny, where events can be mischaracterized and drive amplified reactions. Schering-Plough believes that new scientific data are best presented and discussed at appropriate scientific and medical forums. Early 2008 Developments Relating to the Cholesterol Franchise As explained in more detail in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” “ENHANCE Matter,” in early 2008, Schering-Plough encountered such a challenge when results of a Merck/Schering-Plough cholesterol joint venture clinical trial, called ENHANCE, and joint venture products ZETIA and VYTORIN, became the subject of much media scrutiny prior to fuller discussions of the trial results at appropriate medical forums. A discussion is scheduled for the American College of Cardiology meeting on March 30, 2008. Medical experts and health advisory groups have long recognized high LDL cholesterol (often known as “bad cholesterol”) as a significant cardiovascular risk factor and recommended increasingly aggressive treatment of high cholesterol for certain patients. Lowering LDL cholesterol, along with a healthy diet and lifestyle changes, remains the cornerstone of lipid treatment for patients at risk for heart disease. Clinical studies, including ENHANCE, have demonstrated that VYTORIN lowers patients’ LDL cholesterol more than rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin at the doses studied and was able to get more patients to their LDL cholesterol goals (as defined by ATP III). While it is too early to tell the impact of the joint venture’s ENHANCE trial results on the joint ventures’ cholesterol business, Schering-Plough’s diversified group of products and geographic areas, as well as its highly experienced executive team, gives Schering-Plough additional strength that will be helpful in weathering this situation. Strategic Alliances As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, Schering-Plough licenses manufacturing, marketing and/or distribution rights to certain products to others, and also manufactures, markets and/or distributes products 32 Table of Contents owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements. Any time that third parties are involved, there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of Schering-Plough that may create positive or negative impacts on Schering-Plough. VYTORIN, ZETIA and REMICADE are subject to such arrangements and are key to Schering-Plough’s current business and financial performance. In addition, any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements, which could result in VYTORIN and ZETIA being acquired by Merck or REMICADE reverting back to Centocor. The change in control provision relating to VYTORIN and ZETIA is included in the contract with Merck, filed as Exhibit 10(r) to Schering-Plough’s 10-K, and the change of control provision relating to REMICADE is contained in the contract with Centocor, filed as Exhibit 10(v) to Schering-Plough’s 10-K. Cholesterol Franchise Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, are managed through a joint venture between Schering-Plough and Merck for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels in all markets outside of Japan. ZETIA is Schering-Plough’s novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor (simvastatin), a statin medication developed by Merck. The financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with Merck, and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. The operating results of the joint venture with Merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting. The cholesterol-reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are competing in this market, and on a combined basis, these products continued to grow in terms of sales and market share during 2007 (see note above about 2008 developments). A material change in the sales or market share of Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise would have a significant impact on Schering-Plough’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows. In order to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and business, Schering-Plough must continue to increase profits. This increased profitability is largely dependent upon the performance of Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise. Japan is not included in the joint venture with Merck. In the Japanese market, Bayer Healthcare is co-marketing Schering-Plough’s cholesterol-absorption inhibitor, ZETIA, which was approved in Japan in April 2007 as a monotherapy and co-administered with a statin for use in patients with hypercholesterolemia, familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous sitosterolemia. ZETIA was launched in Japan during June 2007. Schering-Plough’s sales of ZETIA in Japan under the co-marketing agreement with Bayer Healthcare are recognized in net sales. License Arrangements with Centocor REMICADE is prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. REMICADE is Schering-Plough’s second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line (after the cholesterol franchise). REMICADE is licensed from and manufactured by Centocor, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company. During 2005, Schering-Plough exercised an option under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody currently in Phase III trials. Schering-Plough has exclusive marketing rights to both products outside of the U.S., Japan and certain Asian markets. In December 2007, Schering-Plough and Centocor revised their distribution agreement regarding the development, commercialization and distribution of both REMICADE and golimumab, extending Schering-Plough’s rights to exclusively market REMICADE to match the duration of Schering-Plough’s exclusive marketing rights for golimumab. Effective upon regulatory approval of golimumab in the EU, Schering-Plough’s marketing rights for both products will now extend for 15 years after the first commercial sale of golimumab within the EU. Centocor will receive a progressively increased share of profits on Schering-Plough’s distribution of both products in the Schering-Plough marketing territory between 2010 and 2014, and the share of profits will remain fixed thereafter for the remainder of the term. The changes to the duration of REMICADE marketing rights and the profit sharing arrangement for the products are all conditioned on approval of golimumab being granted prior to September 1, 2014. Schering-Plough may independently develop 33 Table of Contents and market golimumab for a Crohn’s disease indication in its territories, with an option for Centocor to participate. In addition, Schering-Plough and Centocor agreed to utilize an autoinjector device in the commercialization of golimumab and further agreed to share its development costs. For the rights to this device, Schering-Plough made an upfront payment of $21 million, which is included in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007. Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Schering-Plough supports commercialized products with manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. Schering-Plough is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business, including capital expenditures for the drug development process (where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets), information technology systems, and post-marketing studies and monitoring. Schering-Plough continually reviews the business, including manufacturing operations, to identify actions that will enhance long-term competitiveness. However, Schering-Plough’s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed, and actions to significantly reduce Schering-Plough’s manufacturing infrastructure, including OBS’ manufacturing operations acquired during 2007, involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. From time to time, actions are taken to enhance Schering-Plough’s overall manufacturing efficiency. For example, during 2006, Schering-Plough closed a manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico and in 2007 began the process of closing a small manufacturing facility in the Asia Pacific region. Schering-Plough continues to review the carrying value of manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments or related costs. Regulatory and Competitive Environment Schering-Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. Regulatory compliance is complex and costly, impacting the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Schering-Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. Research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., the EU, and local country regulatory authorities. Schering-Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. A number of intermediaries are involved between drug manufacturers, such as Schering-Plough, and patients who use the drugs. These intermediaries impact the patient’s ability, and their precribers’s ability, to choose and pay for a particular drug. These intermediaries include health care providers, such as hospitals and clinics; payors and their representatives, such as employers, insurers, managed care organizations and governments; and others in the supply chain, such as pharmacists and wholesalers. Further, in the U.S., many of Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as certain of the intermediaries (including managed care groups, institutions and government agencies) seek price discounts. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost-containment programs. Also, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering-Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering-Plough’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, loss of patent protection due to challenges by competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering-Plough’s products mature. 34 Table of Contents OBS Acquisition On November 19, 2007, Schering-Plough acquired OBS for a purchase price of approximately Euro 11 billion in cash, or approximately $16.1 billion. Commencing from the acquisition date, OBS’ assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the results of OBS’ operations, are included in Schering-Plough’s consolidated financial statements. There were approximately one and one-half months of results of operations relating to OBS included in Schering-Plough’s Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. The impact of purchase accounting, based on a preliminary valuation, resulted in the following non-cash charges in 2007: • Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D), which was a one-time charge of approximately $3.8 billion. • Amortization of inventory adjusted to fair value, of which approximately $1.1 billion will be charged to Cost of Sales ($258 million in 2007) approximately over a one year period from the acquisition date. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets adjusted to fair value, of which $6.8 billion will be amortized over a weighted average life of 15 years to Cost of Sales ($65 million in 2007). • Incremental depreciation relating to the adjustment in fair value on property, plant and equipment of $885 million that will be depreciated primarily to Cost of Sales over the lives of the applicable property ($3 million in 2007). The $3.8 billion acquired IPR&D charge was associated with research projects in the women’s health, central nervous system and anesthesia therapeutic areas of human health as well as research projects in animal health. The amount was determined by using discounted cash flow projections of identified research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which there was no alternative future use. The discount rates used ranged from 14 percent to 18 percent. The projected launch dates following FDA or other regulatory approval are years 2008 through 2013, at which time Schering-Plough expects these projects to begin to generate cash flows. All of the research and development projects considered in the valuation are subject to the normal risks and uncertainties associated with demonstrating the safety and efficacy required to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals. DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS The results of operations in 2007 discussed below include OBS’ product sales and expenses as well as certain non-cash charges relating to purchase accounting associated with the OBS acquisition. Net Sales A significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains in the U.S. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler, retail and trade buying decisions, changes in overall demand factors or other factors. In addition to these fluctuations, sales of many pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups, institutions, government agencies, and other groups seeking discounts. Schering-Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the U.S. market are also required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in the Medicaid program, the veterans health care program, and other government-funded programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare. This prescription drug benefit became effective on January 1, 2006 and is resulting in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment where governments may and have mandated cost-containment 35 Table of Contents programs, placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods to control costs. Consolidated net sales in 2007 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 20 percent as compared to 2006. Consolidated net sales in 2007 included $626 million of OBS’ net sales related to the period subsequent to the acquisition. The increase also reflects the growth in sale volumes of REMICADE, TEMODAR, NASONEX and AVELOX as well as contributions from Animal Health and Consumer Health Care and a favorable impact of 4 percent from foreign exchange. Consolidated net sales in 2006 were $10.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion or 11 percent compared to 2005. The increase primarily reflected the growth in sale volumes of REMICADE, NASONEX, PEGINTRON and TEMODAR. This increase also reflected an unfavorable impact of 1 percent from foreign exchange. Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 (Dollars in millions) HUMAN PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS $ 10,173 $ 8,561 $ 7,564 19 % 13 % REMICADE 1,648 1,240 942 33 32 NASONEX 1,092 944 737 16 28 PEGINTRON 911 837 751 9 11 TEMODAR 861 703 588 22 20 CLARINEX/AERIUS 799 722 646 11 12 CLARITIN Rx 391 356 371 10 (4 ) AVELOX 384 304 228 26 34 INTEGRILIN 332 329 315 1 5 REBETOL 277 311 331 (11 ) (6 ) CAELYX 257 206 181 25 13 INTRON A 233 237 287 (2 ) (17 ) SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE 220 203 197 8 3 ASMANEX 162 103 11 57 N/M Other Pharmaceutical 2,606 2,066 1,979 26 44 ANIMAL HEALTH 1,251 910 851 37 7 CONSUMER HEALTH CARE 1,266 1,123 1,093 13 3 OTC 682 558 556 22 N/M Foot Care 345 343 333 1 3 Sun Care 239 222 204 8 9 CONSOLIDATED NET SALES $ 12,690 $ 10,594 $ 9,508 20 % 11 % N/M — Not a meaningful percentage. Sales of Human Prescription Pharmaceuticals in 2007 totaled $10.2 billion, a $1.6 billion or 19% increase compared to 2006. Included in 2007 are $409 million of net sales related to Organon, the human health business of OBS. Sales of Human Prescription Pharmaceuticals in 2006 totaled $8.6 billion, a $1.0 billion or 13% increase compared to 2005. International net sales of REMICADE, a drug for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis, were up 33 percent to $1.6 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006 driven by continued market growth, expanded use across indications and a favorable impact from foreign 36 Table of Contents exchange. Global net sales increased 32 percent in 2006 to $1.2 billion as compared to 2005, due to greater demand, expanded indications and continued market growth. Competitive products for the indications referred to above have been introduced during 2006 and 2007. Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once-daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 16 percent to $1.1 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to increased sales across all geographic regions, and 28 percent to $944 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, as the product captured greater U.S. and international market share in 2006. Competitive products have been introduced in 2007. Global net sales of PEGINTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, increased 9 percent to $911 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to higher sales in Latin America and emerging markets across Europe, and tempered by lower sales in Japan due to increased competition and a decrease in the U.S. market size. Global net sales increased 11 percent to $837 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 reflecting higher sales volume in Japan and the U.S. In Japan, sales in 2005 benefited from a significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEGINTRON before beginning treatment. Global net sales of TEMODAR Capsules, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased 22 percent to $861 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to increased sales across geographic markets, including Japan, where the product was launched in September 2006. Global net sales increased 20 percent to $703 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the increased utilization for new indications. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.), for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year-round indoor allergies, in 2007 increased 11 percent to $799 million as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher sales in international markets. Global net sales in 2006 increased 12 percent to $722 million as compared to 2005 due to increased demand in Europe and Latin America as well as increased sales in the U.S. despite slightly declining market share. International net sales of prescription CLARITIN increased 10 percent to $391 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 reflecting growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. Sales in 2006 decreased 4 percent to $356 million as compared to 2005. Net sales of AVELOX, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering-Plough as a result of its license agreement with Bayer, increased 26 percent to $384 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily as a result of increased market share. Net sales in 2006 increased 34 percent to $304 million in 2006 as compared to $228 million in 2005 due to share growth and new indications. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, which is sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering-Plough, increased 1 percent to $332 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. During 2006, sales increased 5 percent to $329 million as compared to 2005. Global 2007 net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with PEGINTRON or INTRON A for treating hepatitis C, decreased 11 percent to $277 million as compared to 2006 due to lower patient enrollment in Japan and increased generic competition. Global net sales in 2006 decreased 6 percent to $311 million as compared to 2005 due to lower sales in Europe and increased competition. In Japan, sales in 2005 benefited from the significant number of patients who were waiting for approval of PEGINTRON before beginning hepatitis C treatment. International net sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma, increased 25 percent to $257 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased sales in Latin America and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. Sales in 2006 increased 13 percent to $206 million as compared to 2005 primarily due to an expanding market for this product. Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, decreased 2 percent to $233 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, and 17 percent in 2006 to 37 Table of Contents $237 million as compared to 2005. The decrease in both 2007 and 2006 were due to the conversion to PEGINTRON for treating hepatitis C in Japan. International net sales of SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 8 percent to $220 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of a benefit from foreign exchange. Sales increased 3 percent to $203 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to increased market share. In October 2006, SUBOXONE was approved by the EU, including the 25 member states as well as Iceland and Norway, for the treatment of opioid dependence. Global net sales of ASMANEX, an orally inhaled steroid for asthma, were up 57 percent to $162 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to market share growth in the U.S. Sales increased to $103 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the ASMANEX launch commencing in late 2005. Other pharmaceutical net sales include all net sales of Organon from the date of the acquisition through December 31, 2007 and a large number of lower sales volume human prescription pharmaceutical products. Net sales of Organon were $409 million in 2007 and included $57 million for FOLLISTIM/PUREGON, a fertility treatment, and $45 million for NUVARING, a contraception product. Also included in other pharmaceutical sales are several lower volume products which are often sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple source products no longer protected by patents. These products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. Included in other pharmaceutical sales is sales of Schering-Plough’s albuterol products. In 2005, the FDA issued a Final Rule that requires all CFC albuterol products, including Schering-Plough’s PROVENTIL CFC, be removed from the market no later than December 31, 2008. Schering-Plough’s transition to albuterol HFA (PROVENTIL HFA) is complete. Schering-Plough no longer manufactures the CFC product and all remaining CFC inventories have been sold during 2007. Schering-Plough is uncertain as to the ultimate impact on Schering-Plough’s overall future sales of PROVENTIL HFA, due to the complexities and multiple external factors influencing this transition, including competing albuterol HFA products. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 37 percent to $1.3 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006. Included in global Animal Health net sales are $217 million related to Intervet, the animal health business of OBS, for the period subsequent to the acquisition. Global net sales in 2007 also benefited from solid growth in all geographic areas, led by the cattle and companion animal product lines, coupled with a positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Global net sales increased 7 percent in 2006 to $910 million as compared to 2005, reflecting strong growth of core brands across most geographic and species areas led by higher sales of companion animal products. The Animal Health segment’s sales growth rate is impacted by intense competition and the frequent introduction of generic products. Global net sales of Consumer Health Care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased 13 percent or $143 million as compared to 2006. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to the sales of MiraLAX, which was launched in February 2007 as the first Rx-to-OTC switch in the laxative category in more than 30 years, and higher sales of OTC CLARITIN. Global net sales in 2006 increased 3 percent or $30 million as compared to 2005 reflecting an increase in sales of sun care products and DR. SCHOLL’S and other foot care products. Sales of OTC CLARITIN increased 18 percent to $462 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to sales growth across all product forms. OTC CLARITIN sales decreased 1 percent in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of the restrictions on the retail sale of OTC products containing pseudoephedrine (PSE). In addition, OTC CLARITIN continues to face competition from private labels and branded loratadine, and a competing prescription antihistamine was launched for OTC sale in early 2008. Net sales of sun care products increased $17 million or 8 percent in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY line extensions, and $18 million or 9 percent in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to the success of new COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY products launched in 2005. Future sales in the Consumer Health Care segment are difficult to predict because the consumer health care market is highly competitive, with heavy advertising to consumers and frequent competitive product introductions. 38 Table of Contents Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin 65.3 % 65.1 % 64.8 % 0.2 % 0.3 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) $ 5,468 $ 4,718 $ 4,374 15.9 % 7.9 % Research and development (R&D) 2,926 2,188 1,865 33.7 % 17.3 % Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) 3,754 — — N/M N/M Other (income)/expense, net (683 ) (135 ) 5 N/M N/M Special and acquisition-related charges 84 102 294 N/M N/M Equity income (2,049 ) (1,459 ) (873 ) 40.4 % N/M N/M — Not a meaningful percentage Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in Schering-Plough’s net sales. The results of these sales are reflected in equity income. In addition, due to the virtual nature of the joint venture, Schering-Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative expenses that are not captured in equity income but are included in Schering-Plough’s Statements of Consolidated Operations. As a result, Schering-Plough’s gross margin, and ratios of SG&A expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the joint venture’s operating results. Gross margin Gross margin was 65.3 percent in 2007 as compared to 65.1 percent in 2006. Gross margin in 2007 was unfavorably impacted by $326 million of purchase accounting adjustments included in cost of sales. These purchase accounting adjustments were a result of the amortization of fair values of certain assets acquired as part of the OBS acquisition. Gross margin in 2007, when compared to 2006, benefited from realized cost savings of approximately $100 million from manufacturing streamlining in 2006, the non-recurrence of $146 million of charges associated with the aforementioned manufacturing streamlining actions and favorable product mix. Despite negative impacts on cost of sales from the costs resulting from Schering-Plough’s actions to streamline its manufacturing operations during 2006, gross margin increased to 65.1 percent in 2006 from 64.8 percent in 2005. This improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products and process improvements within Schering-Plough’s supply chain, including cost savings from the manufacturing streamlining activities completed during 2006. In 2006, cost of sales included charges totaling $146 million associated with Schering-Plough’s actions to streamline its manufacturing operations, offset by savings of approximately $30 million as a result of these actions. See Note 3, “Special and Acquisition Related Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” for additional information. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 16 percent to $5.5 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006. Included in SG&A in 2007 were $227 million from OBS. In addition, the increase in SG&A reflects higher promotion spending, ongoing investments in emerging markets and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. SG&A increased 8 percent to $4.7 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, reflecting ongoing investments in emerging markets and field support for product launches as well as higher promotional spending. 39 Table of Contents Research and development Research and development (R&D) spending increased 34 percent to $2.9 billion in 2007 as compared to the 2006 period. Included in R&D in 2007 were $111 million from OBS. Also included in R&D were upfront payments of $197 million mainly related to certain licensing transactions. The increase in R&D spending versus 2006 also reflects higher spending for clinical trials and related activities and investments to build greater breadth and capacity to support the continued expansion of Schering-Plough’s pipeline. In 2006, R&D spending increased 17 percent to $2.2 billion as compared to the 2005 period. The 2006 increase was due to higher costs associated with clinical trials as well as building greater breadth and capacity to support Schering-Plough’s progressing pipeline. Generally, changes in R&D spending reflect the timing of Schering-Plough’s funding of both internal research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. To maximize Schering-Plough’s chances for the successful development of new products, Schering-Plough began a Development Excellence initiative in 2005 to build talent and critical mass, create a uniform level of excellence and deliver on high-priority programs within R&D. In 2006, Schering-Plough began a Global Clinical Harmonization Program to maximize and globalize the quality of clinical trial execution, pharmacovigilance and regulatory processes. In 2007, certain aspects of the Global Clinical Harmonization Program have been implemented. Acquired in-process research and development The acquired in-process research and development charge of $3.8 billion in 2007 was a result of the OBS acquisition and represents the immediate expense recognition of the fair value of acquired research projects for which technological feasibility has not been established and for which there is no alternative future use. Other (income)/expense, net Schering-Plough had other income, net, of $683 million in 2007 compared to $135 million of other income, net, in 2006 and other expense, net, of $5 million in 2005. Other income, net, in 2007 included net realized gains on foreign currency options of $510 million related to the OBS acquisition. The increase in other income, net, in 2007 also reflected higher interest income due to higher balances of cash equivalents and short-term investments partially offset by higher interest expense due to the issuance of new debt. Special and acquisition related charges and manufacturing streamlining 2007 special and acquisition related charges During the year ended December 31, 2007, Schering-Plough incurred $84 million of special and acquisition-related charges, comprised of $61 million of integration-related costs for the OBS acquisition and $23 million of severance charges as part of integration activities. 2006 manufacturing streamlining During 2006, Schering-Plough implemented changes to its manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico and New Jersey that have streamlined its global supply chain and further enhanced Schering-Plough’s long-term competitiveness. These changes resulted in the phase-out and closure of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations in Manati, Puerto Rico, and additional workforce reductions in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and New Jersey. In total, these actions resulted in the elimination of over 1,000 positions. Schering-Plough expects these actions to yield an annualized cost savings of approximately $100 million. Special charges: Special charges in 2006 related to the changes in Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations totaled $102 million. These charges consisted of approximately $47 million of severance and $55 million of fixed asset impairments. Cost of Sales: Included in 2006 cost of sales was approximately $146 million consisting of $93 million of accelerated depreciation, $46 million of inventory write-offs, and $7 million of other charges related to the closure of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing facilities in Manati, Puerto Rico. 40 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activities reflected in the consolidated financial statements related to changes to Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations which were completed in 2006: Charges included in Special Total Cash Non-cash Accrued Cost of sales charges charges payments charges Liability (Dollars in millions) Accrued liability at January 1, 2006 $ — Severance $ — $ 47 $ 47 $ (35 ) $ — 12 Asset impairments — 55 55 — (55 ) — Accelerated depreciation 93 — 93 — (93 ) — Inventory write-offs 46 — 46 — (46 ) — Other 7 — 7 (2 ) (5 ) — Total $ 146 $ 102 $ 248 $ (37 ) $ (199 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2006 $ 12 Severance (12 ) (12 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2007 $ — 2005 special charge activities Special charges incurred in 2005 are as follows: 2005 (Dollars in Millions) Litigation charges $ 250 Employee termination costs 28 Asset impairment and other charges 16 $ 294 Litigation Charges: In 2005, litigation reserves were increased by $250 million. This increase resulted in a total reserve of $500 million for the Massachusetts Investigation, as well as the investigations and the state litigation disclosed under “AWP Litigation and Investigations” in Note 20, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” representing Schering-Plough’s then current estimate to resolve this matter. On August 29, 2006, Schering-Plough announced it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the Massachusetts Investigation for an aggregate amount of $435 million plus interest. This settlement amount relates only to the Massachusetts Investigation. The AWP investigations and litigation are ongoing. During 2007, Schering-Plough made payments totaling $435 million related to this settlement. Employee termination costs: Employee termination costs in 2005 consisted of $7 million associated with a Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) in the U.S. during 2003 and $21 million of other employee termination costs. Asset impairment and other charges: For the year ended December 31, 2005, Schering-Plough recognized asset impairment and other charges of $16 million related primarily to the consolidation of Schering-Plough’s U.S. biotechnology organizations. Equity income Sales of the Merck/Schering-Plough cholesterol joint venture totaled $5.2 billion, $3.9 billion, and $2.4 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The sales growth in 2007 was due primarily to higher market share and market growth in the U.S. and continued expansion into international markets. The sales growth in 2006 was due primarily to an increase in market share. 41 Table of Contents The companies bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the cholesterol agreements provide for a reimbursement to each company for physician details that are set on annual basis, and in Italy, a contractual amount is included in the profit sharing calculation that is not reimbursed. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, this amount is equal to each company’s physician details multiplied by a contractual fixed fee. Schering-Plough reports these amounts as part of equity income. These amounts do not represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs for Schering-Plough’s detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, these amounts are not reflective of Schering-Plough’s sales effort related to the joint venture, as Schering-Plough’s sales force and related costs associated with the joint venture are generally estimated to be higher. Costs of the joint venture that the companies contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct-to-consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out-of-pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by Schering-Plough and Merck. Under certain conditions, as specified in the joint venture agreements with Merck, Schering-Plough could be entitled to receive reimbursements of its future research and development expenses of up to $105 million. Additional information regarding the joint venture with Merck is also included in Note 4, “Equity Income,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Equity income from the Merck/Schering-Plough joint venture totaled $2.0 billion, $1.5 billion, and $873 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 equity income as compared to 2006 reflected higher market share in the U.S. and international sales growth. The increase in 2006 equity income as compared to 2005 reflected continued strong sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA. During 2005, Schering-Plough recognized milestones from Merck of $20 million related to certain European approvals of VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) in 2005. It should be noted that Schering-Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative and other costs, which are not reflected in equity income and instead are included in the overall cost structure of Schering-Plough. Provision for income taxes Tax expense was $258 million, $362 million, and $228 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The 2007 tax provision included tax benefits of $89 million related to the amortization of fair values of certain assets acquired as part of the OBS acquisition. The 2006 income tax provision primarily relates to foreign taxes. The 2005 tax provision includes a benefit of $46 million related to an IRS Notice issued in August 2005, which resulted in a reduction of the previously accrued tax liability attributable to repatriations under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The tax provisions in 2007, 2006 and 2005 do not include any benefit related to U.S. operating losses. During 2004, Schering-Plough established a valuation allowance on its net U.S. deferred tax assets, including the benefit of U.S. operating losses, as management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the benefit of the U.S. net deferred tax assets can be realized. At December 31, 2007, Schering-Plough continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. Schering-Plough expects to report a U.S. Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward of $1.7 billion on its tax return for the year ended December 31, 2007. This U.S. NOL carryforward could be materially reduced after examination of Schering-Plough’s income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 2007, Schering-Plough generated approximately $980 million in U.S. losses including the impact of purchase accounting, however, due to differences between financial and tax reporting, Schering-Plough expects to report a minimal increase in its NOL on its 2007 U.S. tax return. Schering-Plough implemented the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007. As required by FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the Interpretation was reported as an adjustment to Schering-Plough’s retained earnings 42 Table of Contents balance as of January 1, 2007. Schering-Plough reduced its January 1, 2007 retained earnings by $259 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Schering-Plough’s unrecognized tax benefits result primarily from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property) as well as Schering-Plough’s tax matters litigation (see Note 20, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” for additional information). At January 1, and December 31, 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $924 million and $859 million, respectively, which includes reductions to deferred tax assets carrying a full valuation allowance, potential refund claims and tax liabilities. At January 1, and December 31, 2007, approximately $645 million and $535 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease over the next twelve-month period by up to $615 million. This decrease would be primarily attributable to a decision in the tax matter currently being litigated in Newark District Court, possible final resolution of Schering-Plough’s 1997 — 2002 examination at IRS Appeals and possible resolutions of various other matters. However, the timing of the ultimate resolution of Schering-Plough’s tax matters and the payment and/or receipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside Schering-Plough’s control. Schering-Plough includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The total amount of accrued interest related to tax positions at January 1, and December 31, 2007 was $193 million and $197 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities. During the second quarter of 2007, the IRS completed its examination of Schering-Plough’s 1997-2002 federal income tax returns. Schering-Plough is seeking resolution of an issue raised during this examination through the IRS administrative appeals process. Schering-Plough remains open with the IRS for the 1997 — 2007 tax years. For most of its other significant tax jurisdictions (both U.S. state and foreign), Schering-Plough’s income tax returns are open for examination for the period 2000 through 2007. Net (loss)/income available to common shareholders Schering-Plough had a net (loss)/income available to common shareholders of $(1.6) billion, $1.1 billion and $183 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net loss available to common shareholders for 2007 included approximately $4.0 billion of charges related to purchase accounting for the OBS acquisition, including a $3.8 billion acquired in-process research and development charge. Net loss available to common shareholders for 2007 included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $118 million related to the 2004 and 2007 Preferred Stock. Net income available to common shareholders for 2006 and 2005 included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $86 million, in each period, related to the 2004 Preferred Stock. Net (loss)/income available to common shareholders for 2007, 2006, and 2005 also included special and acquisition related charges and manufacturing streamlining costs of approximately $84 million, $248 million, and $294 million, respectively. See Note 3, “Special and Acquisition Related Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) Cash flow from operating activities $ 2,630 $ 2,161 $ 882 Cash flow from investing activities (13,156 ) (2,908 ) (454 ) Cash flow from financing activities 10,089 (1,361 ) (633 ) 43 Table of Contents Operating Activities In 2007, operating activities provided $2.6 billion of cash, compared with net cash provided by operations of $2.2 billion in 2006. The increase was primarily due to a net realized gain of $510 million from foreign currency options relating to the OBS acquisition, higher net sales and equity income, partially offset by payments of $435 million for the settlement of the Massachusetts Investigation and $98 million for tax and interest due in connection with an examination by the IRS of Schering-Plough’s 1997-2002 federal income tax returns. During 2007, as part of an overall risk management strategy and in consideration of various preliminary financing scenarios associated with the acquisition of OBS, Schering-Plough purchased euro-denominated currency options (derivatives) for aggregate premiums of approximately $165 million and received proceeds of $675 million upon the termination of these options, resulting in a net realized gain of $510 million. These derivatives were short-term (trading) in nature and did not hedge a specific financing or investment transaction. Accordingly, the cash impacts of these derivatives have been classified as operating cash flows in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion as compared to 2005. The increase primarily resulted from higher net income and the timing of operating cash payments and receipts. In 2005, operating activities generated $882 million of cash including payments of approximately $375 million to tax authorities for tax liabilities related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA; and tax payments of $239 million related to the settlement of certain tax contingencies for the tax years 1993 through 1996. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during 2007 was $13.2 billion, primarily consisting of $15.8 billion of net cash used to purchase OBS. In addition, source of cash for investing activities included a net reduction of short-term investments of $3.3 billion partially offset by $618 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities during 2006 was $2.9 billion primarily related to the net purchases of short-term investments of $2.4 billion previously invested in cash equivalents and $458 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities during 2005 was $454 million, primarily related to $478 million of capital expenditures and the purchase of intangible assets of $51 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $43 million and the net reduction in short-term investments of $33 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $10.1 billion for 2007, compared to cash used of $1.4 billion for the same period in 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 included net proceeds on the issuance of common and mandatory convertible preferred shares of approximately $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, and net proceeds of approximately $6.4 billion on the issuance of long-term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities also included $225 million of proceeds from stock option exercises offset by the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $481 million. Net cash used for financing activities during 2006 and 2005 was $1.4 billion and $633 million, respectively. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2006 and 2005 include the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $412 million and $410 million, respectively; the repayment of $1.0 billion of bank debt and short-term commercial paper borrowings in 2006; and $1.2 billion of short-term commercial paper borrowings in 2005. Uses of cash for financing activities in 2005 was partially offset by proceeds of $900 million from bank debt incurred by a foreign subsidiary related to funding of a portion of the repatriations under the AJCA during 2005. This bank debt was fully repaid in 2006. 44 Table of Contents Other Discussion of Cash Flows Schering-Plough is moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business and currently is in the process of building a U.S. pharmaceutical sciences center in New Jersey. Capital expenditures of approximately $50 million and $40 million were made in 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to this center. Additional capital expenditures of approximately $175 million are expected over the next two years. This center will allow Schering-Plough to streamline and integrate its drug development process, where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to market. There will be additional related expenditures to upgrade equipment and staffing for this center. At December 31, 2007, Schering-Plough had net debt (total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities) of $7.1 billion. Cash generated from operations, available cash and short-term investments and available credit facilities are expected to provide Schering-Plough with the ability to fund cash needs for the intermediate term. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On September 17, 2007, Schering-Plough issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00 percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.55 percent senior unsecured notes due 2037. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.0 billion. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. The effective interest rate on the 6.00 percent senior unsecured notes and the 6.55 percent senior unsecured notes, which incorporates the initial discount and debt issuance fees, is 6.13 percent and 6.67 percent, respectively. The interest rate payable on these notes is not subject to adjustment. The notes generally restrict Schering-Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 10 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. These notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at Schering-Plough’s option at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100 percent of the principal amount of such notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the rate of Treasury Notes with comparable remaining terms plus 25 basis points for the 2017 notes or 30 basis points for the 2037 notes. If a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined in the prospectus, holders of the notes will have the right to require Schering-Plough to repurchase all or any part of the notes for a cash payment equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. On October 1, 2007, Schering-Plough issued Euro 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 percent senior unsecured euro-denominated notes due 2010 and Euro 1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375 percent senior unsecured euro-denominated notes due 2014. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.8 billion. Interest on the notes is payable annually. The effective interest rate on the 5.00 percent senior unsecured euro-denominated notes and the 5.375 percent senior unsecured euro-denominated notes, which incorporates the initial discount, debt issuance fees and the impact of interest rate hedges, is 5.10 percent and 5.46 percent, respectively. The interest rate payable on these notes is not subject to adjustment. The notes generally restrict Schering-Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 10 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. These notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at Schering-Plough’s option at any time, at a redemption price specified in the prospectus. If a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined in the prospectus, holders of the notes will have the right to require Schering-Plough to repurchase all or any part of the notes for a cash payment equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. Schering-Plough used the net proceeds from these notes to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. On October 24, 2007, Schering-Plough entered into a five-year senior unsecured euro-denominated term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. On October 31, 2007, Schering-Plough drew Euro 1.1 billion ($1.6 billion) on this term loan to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. This new term 45 Table of Contents loan has a floating interest rate and requires Schering-Plough to maintain a net debt to total capital ratio of no more than 65 percent through 2009 and 60 percent thereafter, in which net debt equals total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities and total capital equals the sum of total debt and total shareholders’ equity excluding the cumulative effect of acquired in-process research and development in connection with any acquisition consummated after the closing of the term loan. The term loan also generally restricts Schering-Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 12 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. The reported U.S. dollar amounts of the outstanding debt balance and interest expense on the euro-denominated notes and euro-denominated term loan will fluctuate due to the impact of foreign currency translation. On November 26, 2003, Schering-Plough issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment and, in connection with ratings downgrades in 2004, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3 percent to 5.55 percent, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent. The interest rate payable on a particular series of notes will return to 5.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, and the rate adjustment provisions will permanently cease to apply if, the notes are subsequently rated above Baa1 by Moody’s and BBB+ by S&P. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moody’s or S&P is downgraded below A3 or A-, respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 14, “Borrowings and Other Commitments,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. On August 9, 2007, Schering-Plough entered into a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and terminated its $1.5 billion credit facility that was due to mature in May 2009. This credit facility has a floating interest rate, matures in August 2012 and requires Schering-Plough to maintain a net debt to total capital ratio of no more than 65 percent through 2009 and 60 percent thereafter, in which net debt equals total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities and total capital equals the sum of total debt and total shareholders’ equity excluding the cumulative effect of acquired in-process research and development in connection with any acquisition consummated after the closing of the credit facility. The credit facility also generally restricts Schering-Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 12 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. This credit line is available for general corporate purposes and is considered as support to Schering-Plough’s commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under this credit facility may be drawn by the U.S. parent company or by its wholly-owned international subsidiaries when accompanied by a parent guarantee. This facility does not require compensating balances, however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. As of December 31, 2007, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, short-term borrowings, including the credit facilities mentioned above, totaled $451 million and $242 million, respectively, including outstanding commercial paper of $149 million as of both dates. The weighted-average interest rate for short-term borrowings at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 7.9 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively. Schering-Plough’s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes and euro-denominated term loan have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation” (SFAS 52), the foreign currency transaction gains or losses on these euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income. 46 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Schering-Plough’s current unsecured senior credit ratings and outlook are as follows: Long-Term Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings Long-term Short-term Review Status Moody’s Investors Service Baa1 P-2 Stable Standard and Poor’s A− A-2 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB+ F-2 Stable The short-term ratings discussed above have not significantly affected Schering-Plough’s ability to issue or rollover its outstanding commercial paper borrowings at this time. However, Schering-Plough believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as Schering-Plough, with one or more short-term credit ratings of P-2 from Moody’s, A-2 from S&P and/or F-2 from Fitch to issue or rollover outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short-term credit ratings. In addition, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to these issuers is typically less than that of higher-rated companies. Schering-Plough’s sizable lines of credit with commercial banks as well as cash and short-term investments held by U.S. and international subsidiaries serve as alternative sources of liquidity and to support its commercial paper program. Schering-Plough’s credit ratings could decline below their current levels. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on a portion of Schering-Plough’s short and long-term debt. As discussed above, Schering-Plough believes that existing cash and short-term investments, available credit facilities and cash generated from operations will allow Schering-Plough to fund its cash needs for the intermediate term. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock On August 15, 2007, Schering-Plough issued 10,000,000 shares of 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the 2007 Preferred Stock) with a face value of $2.5 billion. Net proceeds to Schering-Plough were approximately $2.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. Schering-Plough used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2007 Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. Each share of the 2007 Preferred Stock will automatically convert into between 7.4206 and 9.0909 common shares of Schering-Plough depending on the average closing price of Schering-Plough’s common shares over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the mandatory conversion date of August 13, 2010, as defined in the prospectus. The preferred shareholders may elect to convert at any time prior to August 13, 2010, at the minimum conversion ratio of 7.4206 common shares per share of the 2007 Preferred Stock. Additionally, if at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date the closing price of Schering-Plough’s common shares exceeds $50.53 (for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days), Schering-Plough may elect to cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, of the 2007 Preferred Stock then outstanding at the same minimum conversion ratio of 7.4206 common shares for each share of 2007 Preferred Stock. The 2007 Preferred Stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of 6 percent on shares outstanding. The dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and, to the extent Schering-Plough is legally permitted to pay dividends and the Board of Directors declares a dividend payable, Schering-Plough will pay dividends on each dividend payment date. The dividend payment dates are February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, with the first dividend to be paid on November 15, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, all shares of 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued on August 10, 2004 (the 2004 Preferred Stock) were converted into 64,584,929 shares of Schering-Plough common stock. 47 Table of Contents Equity Issuance and Treasury Shares On August 15, 2007, Schering-Plough issued 57,500,000 common shares from treasury shares at $27.50 per share. Net proceeds to Schering-Plough were approximately $1.5 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. Schering-Plough used the net proceeds from the sale of the common shares to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. See Note 2, “Acquisition,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Schering-Plough has various contractual obligations that are reported as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and others that are not required to be recognized as liabilities such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts. The following table summarizes payments due by period under Schering-Plough’s known contractual obligations at December 31, 2007. Payments Due by Period Less More than than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 461 $ 461 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt obligations(1) 9,019 — 752 1,657 6,610 Operating lease obligations 907 338 330 168 71 Purchase obligations(2) 2,976 2,736 214 21 5 Deferred compensation plan obligations 192 50 23 63 56 Other obligations(3) 765 363 262 22 118 Total $ 14,320 $ 3,948 $ 1,581 $ 1,931 $ 6,860 (1) Long-term debt obligations include the aggregate principal amount of all long-term debt and excludes interest obligations. See Note 14, “Borrowings and Other Commitments,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. (2) Purchase obligations include advertising and research contracts, capital expenditure commitments and other inventory and expense items, and unless material research milestone payments are likely to be paid do not include potential milestone payments since such payments are contingent on the occurrence of certain events. The table also excludes those research contracts that are cancelable by Schering-Plough without penalty. Other purchase obligations consist of both cancelable and non-cancelable items. (3) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of Schering-Plough’s pension plans, preferred stock dividends, management’s estimate of the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits and other contractual obligations. REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SCHERING-PLOUGH OPERATES Schering-Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. These regulations are described in more detail in Part I, Item I, Business, of this 10-K. Regulatory compliance is complex, as regulatory standards (including Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices) vary by jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. Regulatory compliance is also costly. Regulatory compliance also impacts the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Further, failure to comply with regulations can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recall of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. 48 Table of Contents Regulatory compliance, and the cost of compliance failures, can have a material impact on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, its cash flows or financial condition. Much is still unknown about the science of human health and with every drug there are benefits and risks. Societal and government pressures are constantly shifting between the demand for innovation to meet urgent unmet medical needs and adversity to risk. These pressures impact the regulatory environment and the market for Schering-Plough’s products. Regulatory Compliance and Pharmacovigilance Consent Decree On August 2, 2007, Schering-Plough announced the dissolution of the Consent Decree by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. See Note 19, “Consent Decree,” under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Regulatory Inspections Schering-Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug, in order to alert the drug’s manufacturer and the governmental agency to potential problems. During 2003, pharmacovigilance inspections by officials of the British and French medicines agencies conducted at the request of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) cited serious deficiencies in reporting processes. Schering-Plough has continued to work on its long-term action plan to rectify the deficiencies and has provided regular updates to the EMEA. During the fourth quarter 2005, local UK and EMEA regulatory authorities conducted a follow up inspection to assess Schering-Plough’s implementation of its action plan. In the first quarter of 2006, these authorities also inspected the U.S.-based components of Schering-Plough’s pharmacovigilance system. The inspectors acknowledged that progress had been made since 2003, but also continued to note significant concerns with the quality systems supporting Schering-Plough’s pharmacovigilance processes. Similarly, in a follow up inspection of Schering-Plough’s clinical trial practices in the UK, inspectors identified issues with respect to Schering-Plough’s management of clinical trials and related pharmacovigilance practices. In February 2006, Schering-Plough began the Global Clinical Harmonization Program for building clinical excellence (in trial design, execution and tracking), which will strengthen Schering-Plough’s scientific and compliance rigor on a global basis. In 2007, certain aspects of the Global Clinical Harmonization Program were implemented and work is expected to continue in 2008 and for several years. In addition, during the fourth quarter 2007, the local UK regulatory authority conducted a follow-up inspection which confirmed that the corrective actions committed to by Schering-Plough following the 2006 inspection of Schering-Plough’s UK-based clinical trial operations had in fact been completed. In early January 2008, the local UK regulatory authority returned for a follow-up inspection of Schering-Plough’s UK-pharmacovigilance operations. This inspection likewise confirmed that a number of corrective actions had been completed since the last inspection and noted the number of actions Schering-Plough had taken as set forth in Schering-Plough’s periodic updates to the EMEA and noted a limited number of observations which Schering-Plough is addressing. Schering-Plough intends to continue upgrading skills, processes and systems in clinical practices and pharmacovigilance. Schering-Plough remains committed to accomplish this work and to invest significant resources in this area. Schering-Plough does not know what action, if any, the EMEA or national authorities will take in response to the inspections. Possible actions include further inspections, demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against Schering- Plough and/or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering-Plough’s products. 49 Table of Contents Regulatory Compliance and Post-Marketing Surveillance Schering-Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. These clinical trial research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., EU and local country regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with current Good Clinical Practices or other applicable laws or regulations can result in delays in approval of clinical trials, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, delays in approval of marketing authorizations, criminal sanctions against Schering-Plough and/or responsible individuals, and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering-Plough’s products. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. For the past several years, these occurrences have increased. Recently media mischaracterization of early topline results from the ENHANCE clinical trail led to some concerns among patients and prescribers about ZETIA and VYTORIN (see discussion under “Early 2008 Developments” in the Executive Summary of this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). Schering-Plough’s personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. Following this wave of recent product withdrawals by other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMEA and the PMDA have continued to increase their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re-reviewing select products which are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the U.S., on advertising and promotion and in particular direct-to-consumer advertising. Similarly, major health authorities, including the FDA, EMEA and PMDA, have also increased collaboration amongst themselves, especially with regard to the evaluation of safety and benefit/risk information. Media attention has also increased. In the current environment, a health authority regulatory action in one market, such as a safety labeling change, may have regulatory, prescribing and marketing implications in other markets to an extent not previously seen. Some health authorities, such as the PMDA in Japan, have publicly acknowledged a significant backlog in workload due to resource constraints within their agency. This backlog has caused long regulatory review times for new indications and products and has added to the uncertainty in predicting approval timelines in these markets. While the PMDA has committed to correcting the backlog and has made some progress over the last year, it is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. These and other uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect Schering-Plough’s operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. Schering-Plough has nevertheless achieved a significant number of important regulatory approvals since 2004, including approvals for VYTORIN, NOXAFIL, CLARINEX D-24, CLARINEX REDITABS, CLARINEX D-12, SUBOXONE and new indications for TEMODAR and NASONEX. Other significant approvals since 2004 include ASMANEX DPI (Dry Powder for Inhalation) in the U.S., PEGINTRON, ZETIA, TEMODAR and ESMERON/ESLAX in Japan, and new indications for REMICADE. Schering-Plough also has a number of significant regulatory submissions filed in major markets awaiting approval. Pricing Pressures As described more specifically in Note 20, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 1, “Financial Statements,” the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business 50 Table of Contents practices of Schering-Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorney’s Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state Attorneys General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti-kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject Schering-Plough to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. Schering-Plough also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business. In the U.S., many of Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. In the U.S. market, Schering-Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government-funded programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare. This prescription drug benefit became effective on January 1, 2006 and is resulting in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost-containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements; emphasized greater use of generic drugs; and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods to control costs. Since Schering-Plough is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. Competition The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering-Plough’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering-Plough’s products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. 2008 OUTLOOK Schering-Plough does not provide numeric guidance. However, the following outlook may be helpful to readers in assessing future prospects: See the earlier discussion of matters relating to the Merck/Schering-Plough cholesterol joint venture’s ENHANCE clinical trial. IMS prescription data (U.S.) shows that, to date in 2008, prescriptions for VYTORIN and ZETIA have declined. Although the prescription data has shown some early signs of stabilization, there are limitations to this prescription data and it is too early to discern any trends from this data. It is likely that there will be weekly fluctuations in IMS reported prescription volumes for VYTORIN and ZETIA before any 51 Table of Contents trend can be identified. Wholesalers, retail chains and other trade buyers may respond to these fluctuations by changing their buying patterns or reducing their inventory levels. It is too early to determine the business and financial impact of these lower prescription volumes for 2008 or longer-term. However, first quarter 2008 Merck/Schering-Plough cholesterol joint venture sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. will likely be negatively impacted. Schering-Plough accounts for the joint venture under the equity method. Schering-Plough has been successful in advancing several research and development projects into their late stage. These projects will require sizable resources to complete. Research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase over the next several years as a result of the expanded pipeline, the pipeline projects added through the OBS acquisition and the need for larger, more frequent, and longer clinical trials in the current global regulatory environment. The risks described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations provided in this section. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. For calendar year companies the standard is effective beginning January 1, 2008 except for non-financial items measured on a non-recurring basis for which it is effective beginning January 1, 2009. Based on Schering-Plough’s current financial position the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In November 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (EITF) No. 06-10, “Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefits Aspects of Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements,” which is effective for calendar year companies on January 1, 2008. The Task Force concluded that an employer should recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangement in accordance with either FASB Statement No. 106 or APB Opinion No. 12 based on the substantive agreement with the employee. The Task Force also concluded that an employer should recognize and measure an asset based on the nature and substance of the collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangement. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 also includes an amendment to SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” which applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. This statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Based on Schering-Plough’s current financial position the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In June 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07-3, “Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities,” which is effective for calendar year companies on January 1, 2008. The Task Force concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are 52 Table of Contents delivered or the services are performed, or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07-1, “Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements,” which is effective for calendar year companies on January 1, 2009. The Task Force clarified the manner in which costs, revenues and sharing payments made to, or received by a partner in a collaborative arrangements should be presented in the income statement and set forth certain disclosures that should be required in the partners’ financial statements. Schering-Plough is currently assessing the potential impacts of implementing this standard. In December 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB 110), which permits entities, under certain circumstances, to continue to use the “simplified” method of estimating the expected term of plain vanilla options as discussed in SAB No. 107 and in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment.” The guidance in this release is effective January 1, 2008. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations.” For calendar year companies, the standard is applicable to new business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009. SFAS 141 (R) requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Most significantly, SFAS 141 (R) will require that acquisition costs generally be expensed as incurred, certain acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value, and acquired in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date. The standard will also impact certain unresolved matters related to purchase transactions consummated prior to the effective date of the standard. Schering-Plough is currently assessing the potential impacts of implementing this standard. In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51,” which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The standard establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Schering-Plough is currently assessing the potential impacts of implementing this standard. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and estimates are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect Schering-Plough’s financial statements: • Revenue Recognition • Rebates, Discounts and Returns • Provision for Income Taxes • Acquisitions and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property • Accounting for Pensions and Post-retirement Benefit Plans • Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers, which include wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations. Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies, other indirect purchasers and other market participants such as managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers. 53 Table of Contents Schering-Plough recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain federal and state governmental programs; and iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. When recognizing revenue, Schering-Plough estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made; Schering-Plough defers the recognition of revenue. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re-evaluated as part of this process. Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, Schering-Plough would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with wholesalers, managed-care organizations and government purchasers and certain other market conditions. Rebates are estimated based on sales and contract terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Schering-Plough evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of third party demand and market research data as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition including expected generic introductions, or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of return reserves. Schering-Plough’s agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers address a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of these agreements, Schering-Plough expects to avoid situations where Schering-Plough’s shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Schering-Plough’s rebate accruals for Federal and State governmental programs, including Medicaid and Medicare Part D, at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $114 million and $115 million, respectively. Commercial discounts, returns, and other rebate accruals at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $412 million and $371 million, respectively. These accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized, resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of liabilities, which are included in total current liabilities, or in the case of returns and other receivable adjustments, an allowance provided against accounts receivable. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, Schering-Plough’s payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy Schering-Plough’s obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 20, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially exceed amounts accrued. 54 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2007 2006(1) (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 486 $ 522 OBS’ accruals acquired November 19, 2007 63 — Provision for Rebates 609 474 Adjustment to prior-year estimates (31 ) (56 ) Payments (569 ) (460 ) 9 (42 ) Provision for Returns 142 124 Adjustment to prior-year estimates (24 ) (8 ) Returns (137 ) (121 ) (19 ) (5 ) Provision for Discounts 752 605 Adjustment to prior-year estimates (2 ) (6 ) Discounts granted (763 ) (588 ) (13 ) 11 Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, End of Period $ 526 $ 486 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2006, the adjustment to prior-year estimates for rebates includes $24 million related to the reversal of previously accrued rebate amounts recorded in 2005 and 2004 for the U.S. Government’s TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program that a U.S. Federal Court ruled pharmaceutical manufacturers were not obligated to pay. In formulating and recording the above accruals, management utilizes assumptions and estimates that include historical experience, wholesaler data, the projection of market conditions, the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate, utilization estimates, and forecasted product demand amounts as discussed under the critical accounting policy entitled “Revenue Recognition.” As part of its review of these accruals, management performs a sensitivity analysis that considers differing assumptions, which are most subject to judgment in its rebate accrual calculation. Based upon Schering-Plough’s sensitivity analysis, reasonably possible changes to assumptions related to rebate accruals could favorably or unfavorably impact 2008 net sales and income before taxes in an amount consistent with 2007. Provision for Income Taxes Schering-Plough implemented the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007. As required by FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the Interpretation was reported as an adjustment to Schering-Plough’s retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. Schering-Plough reduced its January 1, 2007 retained earnings by $259 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Schering-Plough’s unrecognized tax benefits result primarily from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property) as well as Schering-Plough’s tax matters litigation (see Note 20, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters”). At January 1, and December 31, 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $924 million and $859 million, respectively, which includes reductions to deferred tax assets carrying a full valuation allowance, potential refund claims and tax liabilities. At January 1, and December 31, 2007, approximately $645 million and $535 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease over the 55 Table of Contents next twelve-month period by up to $615 million. This decrease would be primarily attributable to a decision in the tax matter currently being litigated in Newark District Court, possible final resolution of the taxpayer’s 1997 – 2002 examination at IRS Appeals and possible resolutions of various other matters. However, the timing of the ultimate resolution of Schering-Plough’s tax matters and the payment and/or receipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside Schering-Plough’s control. Schering-Plough includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The total amount of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions at January 1, and December 31, 2007 was $193 million and $197 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities. Schering-Plough records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Schering-Plough has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event Schering-Plough were to determine that it would be able to realize all or an additional portion of its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should Schering-Plough subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or an additional portion of its remaining net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Acquisitions and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property Schering-Plough accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized based on sales over the expected life of the asset. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations. Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, which considers various characteristics of the asset, including projected cash flows. Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $9.9 billion at December 31, 2007. Intangible assets and goodwill increased significantly during 2007 due to the acquisition of OBS. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $570 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2007. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. Certain of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing sites operate below capacity. Overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased due to the Consent Decree and other compliance activities. Schering-Plough’s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to significantly reduce Schering-Plough’s manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments and/or related costs. 56 Table of Contents Accounting for Pension and Post-retirement Benefit Plans Pension and other post-retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions. Schering-Plough assesses its pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, Schering-Plough considers many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, Schering-Plough’s historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (see Note 8, “Retirement Plans and Other Post-retirement Benefits,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information). Discount rates used for pension and other post-retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high-quality fixed income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. In countries where debt instruments are thinly traded, estimates are based on available market rates. Actuarial assumptions are based upon management’s best estimates and judgment. With other assumptions held constant, an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated favorable impact of $43 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost and an increase of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated favorable impact of $17 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost. With other assumptions held constant, a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $41 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost and a decrease of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $17 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost. These sensitivities are based on estimated net pension and post-retirement benefit cost in 2008 which includes the annual impact of OBS’ plans. The expected rates of return for the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans represent the average rates of return to be earned on plan assets over the period during which the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Schering-Plough determines expected returns for each of the major asset classes, principally equities, fixed income and real estate. The return expectations for these asset classes are based on assumptions for economic growth and inflation, which are supported by long-term historical data as well as Schering-Plough’s actual experience of return on plan assets. The expected portfolio performance also reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Expected returns are based primarily on a calculated market-related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from Schering-Plough’s expected returns for the majority of the assets are realized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. Total unrecognized net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other post-retirement benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering-Plough’s U.S. Retirement Plan is allocated 65 percent to equities; 28 percent to fixed income investments; and 7 percent to real estate. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering-Plough’s U.S. other post-retirement benefit plan is allocated 70 percent to equities and 30 percent to fixed income investments. The portfolios’ equity weightings are consistent with the long-term nature of the plans’ benefit obligations. For non-U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local governmental rules and regulations. Substantially all investments in equities and fixed income are valued based on quoted public market values. All investments in real estate are valued based on periodic appraisals. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,” an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R. Effective December 31, 2006, Schering-Plough accounts for its retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158. Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2006, was reduced by 57 Table of Contents approximately 7 percent upon the adoption of SFAS No. 158. See Note 8, “Retirement Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” for additional information. SFAS 158 allows an extended adoption date for the requirement to have Schering-Plough’s year-end date as the measurement date for all defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. For the plans which had measurement dates other than year-end prior to the adoption of SFAS 158, Schering-Plough adopted the year-end measurement date effective with 2007. The impact on the consolidated financial statements related to this measurement date change was not material. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis including insurance coverages. Schering-Plough reviews the status of all claims, investigations and legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. From time to time, Schering-Plough may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions management believes are in the best interests of Schering-Plough. Resolution of any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE Schering-Plough is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Schering-Plough has subsidiaries in more than 55 countries. In 2007, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 64 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, Schering-Plough’s reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula-based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of international operations using derivative financial instruments. Because Schering-Plough’s international subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover can provide a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that Schering-Plough’s international operations are widespread. In addition, at any point in time, Schering-Plough’s international subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. These financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short-term, third-party and intercompany receivables and payables. Changes in exchange rates affect the translated value of these financial assets and liabilities. Gains or losses that arise from translation do not affect net income. On occasion, Schering-Plough has used derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures. During 2007, as part of an overall risk management strategy and in consideration of various preliminary financing scenarios associated with the acquisition of OBS, Schering-Plough purchased euro-denominated currency options to mitigate its exposure in the event there was a significant strengthening in the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar. Schering-Plough purchased the options for aggregate premiums of approximately $165 million and received proceeds of $675 million upon the termination of these options, resulting in a net realized gain of $510 million. These derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS 133). Accordingly, the gain on these derivatives was recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As of December 31, 2007, there were no open foreign currency option contracts. Schering-Plough’s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes and euro-denominated term loan have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS 52, the foreign currency transaction gains or losses on these euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income. 58 Table of Contents Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and/or equity prices are primarily cash equivalents, short-term investments and the debt and equity securities held in qualified and non-qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled more than $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007. For cash equivalents and short-term investments, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $36 million. For securities held in qualified and non-qualified trusts, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, Schering-Plough’s exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates are primarily short-term borrowings and the long-term floating-rate euro-denominated term loan. Schering-Plough has long-term fixed rate debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the debt by approximately $256 million. During 2007, Schering-Plough executed a series of interest rate swaps in anticipation of financing the acquisition of OBS. The objective of the swaps was to hedge the interest rate payments to be made on future issuances of debt. As such, the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of future interest payments, and in accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in operations. In connection with the euro-denominated debt issuances as described in Note 14, “Borrowings and Other Commitments,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” portions of the swaps were deemed ineffective and Schering-Plough recognized a $7 million loss in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The effective portion of the swaps of $12 million was recorded in other comprehensive income and is being recognized as interest expense over the life of the related debt. As of December 31, 2007, there were no open interest rate swaps.

310158,MRK,"Merck & Co., Inc.",2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview of Schering-Plough Schering-Plough is an innovation-driven science-centered global health care company. Schering-Plough discovers, develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals for three customer markets — prescription, animal health, and consumer. While most of the research and development activity is directed toward prescription products, there are important applications of this central research and development platform into the animal health products and the consumer health care products. Schering-Plough also accesses external innovation via partnering, in-licensing and acquisition for all three customer markets. Strategy — Focused on Science In 2003, soon after Fred Hassan was elected as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Schering-Plough Corporation, he initiated a six-to-eight year strategic plan, called the Action Agenda. A key component of the Action Agenda is applying science to meet unmet medical needs. A core strategy of Schering-Plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments that address important unmet medical needs and also have commercial value. Consistent with this core strategy, Schering-Plough has increased its investment in research and development. Schering-Plough has been successful in advancing the pipeline and has several late-stage projects that will require sizable resources to complete. Schering-Plough continues to develop the later-phase pipeline compounds (e.g., golimumab, sugammadex in the U.S., thrombin receptor antagonist, vicriviroc, boceprevir and asenapine), and its progressing early pipeline includes drug candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Another key component of the Action Agenda is the focus on building long-term value for shareholders and for the patients who rely upon Schering-Plough’s drugs. This longer-term focus includes concurrent emphasis on growing sales, disciplined cost controls and investing in research and development for the future. Early on, Hassan, and the new management team that he recruited, applied the Action Agenda to stabilizing, repairing and turning around Schering-Plough after Schering-Plough encountered challenges earlier this decade under a prior management team. Currently, Schering-Plough continues work in the fourth of five phases of the Action Agenda. During the fourth, or Build the Base phase, Schering-Plough continues to focus on its strategy of value creation across a broad front. Over the past five years, sales of Schering-Plough pharmaceutical products across an array of therapeutic areas showed strong growth compared to prior periods and other pharmaceutical companies. Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical sales and marketing activities were further expanded in newer markets. This geographic diversity adds to growth and makes performance less sensitive to any one geographic area. Substantial progress was made with the integration of Organon BioSciences N.V. (OBS), purchased from Akzo Nobel in late 2007. That acquisition was transformative, giving Schering-Plough: • Key new pipeline projects (including asenapine for schizophrenia and bipolar disease and sugammadex to reverse deep anesthesia); • Key products in two new therapeutic areas — Women’s Health and Central Nervous System; • A position as a leader in Animal Health by combining Schering-Plough Animal Health with Intervet; • A leadership position in animal vaccines at Intervet and early-stage innovation capabilities in human vaccines at Nobilon; 33 Table of Contents • Additional state-of-the-art biologics capabilities; • A substantial expansion to the Company’s geographic footprint; and • Significant talent, including in key research and development functions. In April 2008, Schering-Plough announced the Productivity Transformation Program (PTP). The goal of this program, which includes the ongoing integration of OBS, is to create a leaner, stronger company to support Schering-Plough’s goal of building long-term high performance despite the current challenging pharmaceutical industry environment and the particular challenges facing Schering-Plough. This program targets savings of $1.5 billion on an annualized basis by 2012 and is designed to reduce and avoid costs, while increasing productivity. Of the total targeted savings, approximately $1.25 billion are anticipated to be accomplished by the end of 2010 with the balance achieved by 2012. The targeted savings envisioned by this program include those resulting from the previously announced OBS integration synergies. Beyond this program, Schering-Plough anticipates investing in new high-priority clinical trials, the pursuit of strategic opportunities, including product launches and anticipates natural cost growth. As part of the Action Agenda, Schering-Plough continues to work to enhance infrastructure, upgrade processes and systems and strengthen talent. While these efforts are being implemented on a companywide basis, Schering-Plough is focusing especially on research and development to support Schering-Plough’s science-based business. The pharmaceutical industry is under increasing political and regulatory pressure, particularly in the United States and Schering-Plough and the Merck/Schering-Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture have encountered specific challenges during 2008, as explained in more detail in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” Litigation and Investigations relating to the Merck/Schering-Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture. The strength Schering-Plough built during the earlier phases of the Action Agenda, including the diversified group of products, customer segments, and geographic areas, as well as its highly experienced executive team, will be helpful in weathering current and future challenges, including those relating to the Merck/Schering-Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture. Results and Highlights of Schering-Plough’s performance in 2008 are as follows: • Schering-Plough’s net sales for 2008 were $18.5 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion, or 46 percent, as compared to 2007. This increase in net sales was primarily due to the contribution of the products from OBS during 2008. • For 2008, net sales outside the U.S. totaled $12.9 billion. This approximated 70 percent of consolidated net sales. • Net income available to common shareholders for 2008 was $1.8 billion which includes a gain on the divestitures of certain Animal Health products. • Increased sales in 2008, of pharmaceutical products such as REMICADE, TEMODAR and NASONEX as well as increased sales in the Animal Health segment contributed favorably to Schering-Plough’s overall operating results. Overall operating results also benefited from the increased sales of OBS products. • Global combined net sales of Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, decreased 11 percent during 2008 as compared 2007. Combined net sales of the products VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. decreased 24 percent during 2008 as compared to 2007. Strategic Alliances As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, Schering-Plough licenses manufacturing, marketing and/or distribution rights to certain products to others, and also manufactures, markets and/or distributes products owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements. Any time that third parties are involved, there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of Schering-Plough that may 34 Table of Contents create positive or negative impacts on Schering-Plough. VYTORIN, ZETIA and REMICADE are subject to such arrangements and are key to Schering-Plough’s current business and financial performance. In addition, any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements, which could result in VYTORIN and ZETIA being acquired by Merck or REMICADE and golimumab reverting back to Centocor. The change in control provision relating to VYTORIN and ZETIA is included in the contract with Merck, filed as Exhibit 10(r) in this 10-K, and the change of control provision relating to REMICADE and golimumab is contained in the contract with Centocor, filed as Exhibit 10(v) in this 10-K. Cholesterol Franchise Schering-Plough’s cholesterol franchise products, VYTORIN and ZETIA, are managed through a joint venture between Schering-Plough and Merck for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels in all markets outside of Japan. ZETIA is Schering-Plough’s novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor. VYTORIN is the combination of ZETIA and Zocor (simvastatin), a statin medication developed by Merck. The financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol-reduction market is shared with Merck, and profits from the sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are also shared with Merck. The operating results of the joint venture with Merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting. The cholesterol-reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world. VYTORIN and ZETIA are competing in this market. Global total combined sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA for 2008, decreased 11 percent as compared to 2007. During 2008, total combined sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. declined 24 percent as compared to 2007. During 2008, total combined sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA outside the U.S. increased 30 percent as compared to 2007. As of December 2008, total combined prescription share for VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. was down versus December 2007 from 16.9 percent to 10.1 percent. In the past, Schering-Plough’s profitability has been largely dependent upon the performance of the cholesterol franchise; while performance of the cholesterol franchise is still material to Schering-Plough, as the product diversity has become stronger (through the OBS acquisition as well as development of other Schering-Plough products) the dependence on the cholesterol franchise is lessening. Japan is not included in the joint venture with Merck. In the Japanese market, Bayer Healthcare is co-marketing Schering-Plough’s cholesterol-absorption inhibitor, ZETIA, which was approved in Japan in April 2007 as a monotherapy and co-administered with a statin for use in patients with hypercholesterolemia, familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous sitosterolemia. ZETIA was launched in Japan during June 2007. Schering-Plough’s sales of ZETIA in Japan under the co-marketing agreement with Bayer Healthcare are recognized in net sales and included in Other Pharmaceuticals. License Arrangements with Centocor REMICADE is prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. REMICADE is Schering-Plough’s second-largest marketed pharmaceutical product line (after the cholesterol franchise). REMICADE is licensed from and manufactured by Centocor, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company. During 2005, Schering-Plough exercised an option under its contract with Centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody which has been filed for approval in Europe. Schering-Plough has exclusive marketing rights to both products outside the U.S., Japan and certain Asian markets. In December 2007, Schering-Plough and Centocor revised their distribution agreement regarding the development, commercialization and distribution of both REMICADE and golimumab, extending Schering-Plough’s rights to exclusively market REMICADE to match the duration of Schering-Plough’s exclusive marketing rights for golimumab. Effective upon regulatory approval of golimumab in the EU, Schering-Plough’s marketing rights for both products will extend for 15 years after the first commercial sale of golimumab within the EU. Centocor will receive a progressively increased share of profits on Schering-Plough’s distribution of both products in the Schering-Plough marketing territory between 2010 and 2014, and the share of profits will remain fixed thereafter for the remainder of the term. The changes to the duration of REMICADE marketing rights and the profit sharing arrangement for the products are all 35 Table of Contents conditioned on approval of golimumab being granted prior to September 1, 2014. Schering-Plough may independently develop and market golimumab for a Crohn’s disease indication in its territories, with an option for Centocor to participate. In addition, Schering-Plough and Centocor agreed to utilize an autoinjector device in the commercialization of golimumab and further agreed to share its development costs. Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Schering-Plough supports commercialized products with manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. Schering-Plough is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business, including capital expenditures for the drug development process (where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets), information technology systems, and post-marketing studies and monitoring. Schering-Plough continually reviews the business, including manufacturing operations, to identify actions that will enhance long-term competitiveness. However, Schering-Plough’s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed, and actions to significantly reduce Schering-Plough’s manufacturing infrastructure, including specific reductions in the number of Schering-Plough manufacturing facilities that will be made as part of the Productivity Transformation Program involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairments or related costs. Regulatory and Competitive Environment Schering-Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. Regulatory compliance is complex and costly, impacting the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Schering-Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. Research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by the U.S., the EU, and local country regulatory authorities. Schering-Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. A number of intermediaries are involved between drug manufacturers, such as Schering-Plough, and patients who use the drugs. These intermediaries impact the patient’s ability, and their prescribers’ ability, to choose and pay for a particular drug. These intermediaries include health care providers, such as hospitals and clinics; payors and their representatives, such as employers, insurers, managed care organizations and governments; and others in the supply chain, such as pharmacists and wholesalers. Further, in the U.S., many of Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as certain of the intermediaries (including managed care groups, institutions and government agencies) seek price discounts. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs. Also, the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering-Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under continued scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering-Plough’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, loss of patent protection due to challenges by competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering-Plough’s products mature. OBS Acquisition On November 19, 2007, Schering-Plough acquired OBS for a purchase price of approximately Euro 11 billion in cash, or approximately $16.1 billion. 36 Table of Contents Commencing from the acquisition date, OBS’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the results of OBS’s operations, are included in Schering-Plough’s consolidated financial statements. There were approximately one and one-half months of results of operations relating to OBS included in Schering-Plough’s Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. The impact of purchase accounting resulted in the following non-cash charges in 2008 and 2007: • Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D), which was a one-time charge of approximately $3.8 billion in 2007. • Amortization of inventory adjusted to fair value of approximately $1.1 billion was charged to Cost of Sales ($889 million in 2008 and $258 million in 2007). • Amortization of acquired intangible assets adjusted to fair value, of which $6.8 billion will be amortized over a weighted average life of 15 years to Cost of Sales ($527 million in 2008 and $65 million in 2007). • Incremental depreciation relating to the adjustment in fair value on property, plant and equipment of approximately $900 million that will be depreciated primarily to Cost of Sales over the lives of the applicable property ($33 million in 2008 and $3 million in 2007). DISCUSSION OF OPERATING RESULTS The results of operations in 2008 and 2007 discussed below include OBS’s product sales and expenses as well as certain non-cash charges relating to purchase accounting associated with the OBS acquisition. Net Sales Consolidated net sales in 2008 were $18.5 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion or 46 percent as compared to 2007. Consolidated net sales in 2008 included $5.4 billion of net sales of products from OBS. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of OBS, on November 19, 2007. Foreign exchange had an estimated 3% favorable impact on sales in 2008. Since the acquisition of OBS, a greater proportion of Schering-Plough’s sales are denominated in Euros. Net sales outside the U.S. are approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales. Consolidated net sales in 2007 were $12.7 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 20 percent compared to 2006. Consolidated net sales in 2007 included $626 million of net sales of products from OBS related to the period subsequent to the acquisition. The increase primarily reflected the growth in sales volumes of REMICADE, TEMODAR, NASONEX and AVELOX as well as contributions from Animal Health and Consumer Health Care and an estimated favorable impact of 4 percent from foreign exchange. A significant portion of U.S. net sales are made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains. Consequently, net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler, retail and trade buying decisions, changes in overall demand factors or other factors. In addition to these fluctuations, sales of many pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups, institutions, government agencies, and other groups seeking discounts. Schering-Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the U.S. market are also required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in the Medicaid program, the veterans health care program, and other government-funded programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare. This prescription drug benefit became effective on January 1, 2006 and is resulting in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment where governments may and have mandated cost-containment programs, placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods to control costs. 37 Table of Contents Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 were as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS $ 14,253 $ 10,173 $ 8,561 40 % 19 % REMICADE 2,118 1,648 1,240 28 % 33 % NASONEX 1,155 1,092 944 6 % 16 % TEMODAR 1,002 861 703 16 % 22 % PEGINTRON 914 911 837 — 9 % CLARINEX/AERIUS 790 799 722 (1 )% 11 % FOLLISTIM/PUREGON(1) 577 57 — N/M N/M NUVARING(1) 440 45 — N/M N/M CLARITIN Rx 425 391 356 9 % 10 % AVELOX 376 384 304 (2 )% 26 % INTEGRILIN 314 332 329 (5 )% 1 % CAELYX 297 257 206 16 % 25 % REBETOL 260 277 311 (6 )% (11 )% ZEMURON(1) 253 25 — N/M N/M REMERON(1) 239 33 — N/M N/M INTRON A 234 233 237 — (2 )% SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE 230 220 203 5 % 8 % ASMANEX 180 162 103 11 % 57 % Other Pharmaceutical 4,449 2,446 2,066 N/M 18 % ANIMAL HEALTH 2,973 1,251 910 138 % 37 % CONSUMER HEALTH CARE 1,276 1,266 1,123 1 % 13 % OTC 680 682 558 — 22 % Foot Care 357 345 343 3 % 1 % Sun Care 239 239 222 — 8 % CONSOLIDATED NET SALES $ 18,502 $ 12,690 $ 10,594 46 % 20 % (1) Products acquired in OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007 N/M — Not a meaningful percentage. Sales of Prescription Pharmaceuticals in 2008 totaled $14.3 billion, a $4.1 billion or 40 percent increase compared to 2007. Included in 2008 and 2007 are $3.5 billion and $409 million of net sales related to Organon, the human health business of OBS. Sales of Prescription Pharmaceuticals in 2007 totaled $10.2 billion, a $1.6 billion or 19 percent increase compared to 2006. International net sales of REMICADE, a drug for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, early rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis, were up 28 percent to $2.1 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 driven by continued market growth, expanded penetration in certain indications and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. International net sales increased 33 percent in 2007 to $1.6 billion as compared to 2006, due to greater demand, expanded use across indications and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. REMICADE is an anti-TNF antibody, marketed by Schering-Plough outside of the U.S., Japan and certain Asian markets. Competitive products for the indications referred to above have been introduced during 2007 and 2008. 38 Table of Contents Global net sales of NASONEX Nasal Spray, a once-daily corticosteroid nasal spray for allergies, rose 6 percent to $1.2 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to increased sales in the international market and 16 percent to $1.1 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, as the product captured greater U.S. and international market share in 2007. Competitive products have been introduced in 2007 and 2008. Global net sales of TEMODAR, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, increased 16 percent to $1 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to increased sales across geographic regions. Global net sales increased 22 percent to $861 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to increased sales across geographic markets, including Japan, where the product was launched in September 2006. TEMODAR will lose patent exclusivity in the EU in 2009. Global net sales of PEGINTRON Powder for Injection, a pegylated interferon product for treating hepatitis C, were essentially flat in 2008 as compared to 2007, including a favorable impact of foreign exchange. Global net sales increased 9 percent to $911 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to higher sales in Latin America and emerging markets across Europe, and tempered by lower sales in Japan due to increased competition and a decrease in the U.S. market size. Global net sales of CLARINEX (marketed as AERIUS in many countries outside the U.S.), for the treatment of seasonal outdoor allergies and year-round indoor allergies, in 2008 decreased 1 percent to $790 million as compared to 2007 primarily due to lower sales in the United States. Global net sales in 2007 increased 11 percent to $799 million as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher sales in international markets. Global net sales of FOLLISTIM/PUREGON, a recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone for treating infertility, were $577 million in 2008 and $57 million for 2007 (which represent sales from the date of the OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007 through December 31, 2007). FOLLISTIM/PUREGON will lose patent exclusivity in the EU in 2009. Global net sales of NUVARING, a contraception product, were $440 million for 2008 and $45 million for 2007 (which represent sales from the date of the OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007 through December 31, 2007). International net sales of prescription CLARITIN increased 9 percent to $425 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to higher sales in Japan and favorable foreign exchange. Sales in 2007 increased 10 percent to $391 million as compared to 2006, reflecting growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. Net sales of AVELOX, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of certain respiratory and skin infections, marketed in the U.S. by Schering-Plough as a result of its license agreement with Bayer, decreased 2 percent to $376 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, reflecting a decline in the U.S. respiratory tract infection market. Net sales in 2007 increased 26 percent to $384 million in 2007 as compared to $304 million in 2006, primarily as a result of increased market share. Global net sales of INTEGRILIN Injection, a glycoprotein platelet aggregation inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome, that is sold primarily in the U.S. by Schering-Plough, decreased 5 percent to $314 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. During 2007, sales increased 1 percent to $332 million as compared to 2006. International net sales of CAELYX, for the treatment of ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma, increased 16 percent to $297 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to higher sales across Europe and favorable foreign exchange. Sales in 2007 increased 25 percent to $257 million as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased sales in Latin America and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. Global 2008 net sales of REBETOL Capsules, for use in combination with PEGINTRON or INTRON A for treating hepatitis C, decreased 6 percent to $260 million as compared to 2007 due to lower sales in Japan and continued generic competition. Global net sales in 2007 decreased 11 percent to $277 million as compared to 2006 due to lower patient enrollment in Japan and increased generic competition. 39 Table of Contents Global net sales of ZEMURON, a muscle relaxant used in surgical procedures, were $253 million in 2008 and $25 million in 2007 (which represent sales from the date of the OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007, through December 31, 2007). ZEMURON lost patent exclusivity in the U.S. in October 2008 and will lose patent exclusivity in the EU in 2009. Global net sales of REMERON, an antidepressant, were $239 million in 2008 and $33 million in 2007 (which represent sales from the date of the OBS acquisition on November 19, 2007, through December 31, 2007). Global net sales of INTRON A Injection, for chronic hepatitis B and C and other antiviral and anticancer indications, were essentially flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased 2 percent in 2007 to $233 million as compared to 2006. The decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to the conversion to PEGINTRON for treating hepatitis C in Japan. International net sales of SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE, for the treatment of opiate addiction, increased 5 percent to $230 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales increased 8 percent to $220 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increases in 2008 and 2007 resulted primarily from the benefit of foreign exchange. Global net sales of ASMANEX, an orally inhaled steroid for asthma, were up 11 percent to $180 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to market share growth in the U.S. Sales increased to $162 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to the increase in sales in the U.S. Other pharmaceutical net sales include a large number of lower sales volume prescription pharmaceutical products and included $2.0 billion and $249 million of net sales from OBS products for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Several of these products are sold in limited markets outside the U.S., and many are multiple-source products no longer protected by patents. These products include treatments for respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, infectious, oncological and other diseases. Global net sales of Animal Health products increased 138 percent to approximately $3.0 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. Included in global Animal Health net sales are $1.9 billion related to Intervet, the animal health business of OBS. Global net sales in 2008 benefited from solid growth in all geographic areas, led by the cattle, poultry and companion animal product lines, coupled with a positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Global net sales increased 37 percent in 2007 to $1.3 billion as compared to 2006, reflecting strong growth of core brands across most geographic and species areas led by higher sales of companion animal products and the inclusion of Intervet sales. The Animal Health segment’s sales are impacted by intense competition and the frequent introduction of generic products. Global net sales of Consumer Health Care products, which include OTC, foot care and sun care products, increased 1 percent or $10 million as compared to 2007. The increase in 2008 was mainly due to higher sales of MiraLAX, which was launched in February 2007 as the first Rx-to-OTC switch in the laxative category in more than 30 years, offset by lower sales of other OTC products. OTC CLARITIN sales decreased 12 percent to $405 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of increased competition from private-label products. Global net sales in 2007 increased 13 percent or $143 million as compared to 2006 reflecting an increase in sales of sun care products and DR. SCHOLL’S products and the launch of MiraLAX. In addition, sales of OTC CLARITIN increased 18 percent to $462 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to sales growth across all product forms. Net sales of sun care products increased $17 million or 8 percent in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to the success of COPPERTONE CONTINUOUS SPRAY products launched in 2005. The consumer health care market is highly competitive, with heavy advertising to consumers and frequent competitive product introductions, including a former prescription antihistamine that was launched for OTC sales in early 2008, and the impact of U.S. consumers’ purchasing patterns. 40 Table of Contents Costs, Expenses and Equity Income A summary of costs, expenses and equity income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows: % Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin 60.5 % 65.3 % 65.1 % (4.8 )% 0.2 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) $ 6,823 $ 5,468 $ 4,718 24.8 % 15.9 % Research and development (R&D) 3,529 2,926 2,188 20.6 % 33.7 % Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) — 3,754 — N/M N/M Other expense/(income), net 335 (683 ) (135 ) N/M N/M Special and acquisition-related charges 329 84 102 N/M N/M Equity income (1,870 ) (2,049 ) (1,459 ) (9 )% 40.4 % N/M — Not a meaningful percentage Substantially all the sales of cholesterol products are not included in Schering-Plough’s net sales. The results of these sales are reflected in equity income. In addition, due to the virtual nature of the joint venture, Schering-Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative expenses that are not captured in equity income but are included in Schering-Plough’s Statements of Consolidated Operations. As a result, Schering-Plough’s gross margin, and ratios of SG&A expenses and R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales do not reflect the benefit of the impact of the joint venture’s operating results. Gross margin Gross margin was 60.5 percent in 2008 as compared to 65.3 percent in 2007. Gross margin in 2008 and 2007 was unfavorably impacted by $1.4 billion and $326 million, respectively, of purchase accounting adjustments included in cost of sales. These purchase accounting adjustments were a result of the amortization of fair values of primarily inventories and intangible assets acquired as part of the OBS acquisition. Gross margin in 2007, when compared to 2006, benefited from realized cost savings of approximately $100 million from manufacturing streamlining in 2006, the non-recurrence of $146 million of charges associated with the aforementioned manufacturing streamlining actions and favorable product mix. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 25 percent to $6.8 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from OBS and the impact of foreign exchange partially offset by the Productivity Transformation Program savings. SG&A increased 16 percent to $5.5 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, reflecting higher promotion spending, ongoing investments in emerging markets and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Research and development Research and development (R&D) spending increased 21 percent to $3.5 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. Included in R&D in 2007 were upfront payments of $197 million mainly related to certain licensing transactions. The increase in R&D spending versus 2007 also reflects increased spending as a result of the OBS acquisition, as well as higher spending for clinical trials and related activities and investments to build greater breadth and capacity to support Schering-Plough’s expanding global R&D pipeline. In 2007, R&D spending increased 34 percent to $2.9 billion as compared to 2006. The 2007 increase was due to higher costs associated with clinical trials, as well as building greater breadth and capacity to support Schering-Plough’s pipeline. Changes in R&D spending also reflect the timing of Schering-Plough’s funding of both internal 41 Table of Contents research efforts and research collaborations with various partners to discover and develop a steady flow of innovative products. To maximize its chances for the successful development of new products, Schering-Plough began a Development Excellence initiative in 2005 to build talent and critical mass, create a uniform level of excellence and deliver on high-priority programs within R&D. In 2006, Schering-Plough began a Global Clinical Harmonization Program to maximize and globalize the quality of clinical trial execution, pharmacovigilance and regulatory processes. Beginning in 2007, certain aspects of the Global Clinical Harmonization Program have been implemented and continue to be integrated into the processes of OBS. Other expense/(income), net Other expense/(income), net is comprised of the following for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Interest cost incurred $ 555 $ 263 $ 184 Less: amount capitalized on construction (19 ) (18 ) (12 ) Interest expense 536 245 172 Interest income (71 ) (395 ) (297 ) Foreign exchange losses/(gains), net 47 (37 ) 2 Gain on sale of divested products (160 ) — — Realized gain on foreign currency options, net — (510 ) — Ineffective portion of interest rate swaps — 7 — Other, net (17 ) 7 (12 ) Total other expense/(income), net $ 335 $ (683 ) $ (135 ) Schering-Plough had $335 million of other expense, net, for 2008 and $683 million of other income, net, for 2007. Interest expense was higher in 2008 due to the issuance of new debt in connection with the acquisition of OBS in the second half of 2007. Other expense, net, for 2008 includes $160 million ($149 million after tax) of gain on sale of the divestitures of certain Animal Health products as required by regulatory agencies in U.S. and Europe in connection with the acquisition of OBS. In addition, during 2008, Schering-Plough recognized a gain of $17 million ($12 million after tax) on the sale of a manufacturing site. Other income, net, for 2007 included net realized gains on foreign currency options of $510 million related to the OBS acquisition. The increase in Other income, net, in 2007 compared to 2006 also reflected higher interest income due to higher balances of cash equivalents and short-term investments partially offset by higher interest expense due to the issuance of new debt. Special and acquisition-related charges and manufacturing streamlining 2008 Special and acquisition-related charges Special and acquisition-related charges relate to the Productivity Transformation Program activities which include the ongoing integration of the OBS business. Special and acquisition-related charges for 2008 were $329 million. The costs for 2008 included $275 million of employee termination costs. The remaining charges of $54 million related to integration activities. 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the charges, cash payments and liabilities related to the Productivity Transformation Program, which includes the ongoing integration of OBS, through December 31, 2008: Acquisition- Related Liabilities Employee Employee Termination Termination Other Exit Costs Costs Costs (Dollars in millions) Accrued liability at December 31, 2007 $ 23 $ 151 $ — Charges(a) 254 21 — Purchase price allocation items(b) — (3 ) 50 Cash payments (154 ) (169 ) (18 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2008 $ 123 $ — $ 32 (a) Recorded to special and acquisition-related charges. (b) Recorded as part of purchase accounting. Included in acquisition-related liabilities at December 31, 2008 are costs to exit certain activities of OBS. 2007 Special and acquisition-related charges During the year ended December 31, 2007, Schering-Plough incurred $84 million of special and acquisition-related charges, comprised of $61 million of integration-related costs for the OBS acquisition and $23 million of employee termination costs as part of integration activities. 2006 manufacturing streamlining During 2006, Schering-Plough implemented changes to its manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico and New Jersey that have streamlined its global supply chain and further enhanced Schering-Plough’s long-term competitiveness. These changes resulted in the phase-out and closure of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations in Manati, Puerto Rico, and additional workforce reductions in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, and New Jersey. Special charges: Special charges in 2006 related to the changes in Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations totaled $102 million. These charges consisted of approximately $47 million of severance and $55 million of fixed asset impairments. Cost of Sales: Included in 2006 cost of sales was approximately $146 million consisting of $93 million of accelerated depreciation, $46 million of inventory write-offs, and $7 million of other charges related to the closure of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing facilities in Manati, Puerto Rico. 43 Table of Contents The following table summarizes activities reflected in the consolidated financial statements related to changes to Schering-Plough’s manufacturing operations which were completed in 2006: Charges included in Special Total Cash Non-cash Accrued Cost of sales charges charges payments charges Liability (Dollars in millions) Accrued liability at January 1, 2006 $ — Severance $ — $ 47 $ 47 $ (35 ) $ — 12 Asset impairments — 55 55 — (55 ) — Accelerated depreciation 93 — 93 — (93 ) — Inventory write-offs 46 — 46 — (46 ) — Other 7 — 7 (2 ) (5 ) — Total $ 146 $ 102 $ 248 $ (37 ) $ (199 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2006 $ 12 Severance $ (12 ) (12 ) Accrued liability at December 31, 2007 $ — Equity income Sales of the Merck/Schering-Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture totaled $4.6 billion, $5.2 billion and $3.9 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The sales decrease in 2008 was due primarily to lower market share in the U.S. partially offset by continued growth in international markets. The sales growth in 2007, as compared to 2006, was due primarily to an increase in market share. The companies bear the costs of their own general sales forces and commercial overhead in marketing joint venture products around the world. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, the cholesterol agreements provide for a reimbursement to each company for physician details that are set on an annual basis, and in Italy, a contractual amount is included in the profit sharing calculation that is not reimbursed. In the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, this amount is equal to each company’s agreed physician details multiplied by a contractual fixed fee. Schering-Plough reports these amounts as part of equity income. These amounts do not represent a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs for Schering-Plough’s detailing of the cholesterol products in these markets. In addition, these amounts are not reflective of Schering-Plough’s sales effort related to the joint venture, as Schering-Plough’s sales force and related costs associated with the joint venture are generally estimated to be higher. In the U.S. market, Schering-Plough receives a greater share of profits on the first $300 million of annual ZETIA sales. Above $300 million of annual ZETIA sales, Merck and Schering-Plough generally share profits equally. Costs of the joint venture that the companies contractually share are a portion of manufacturing costs, specifically identified promotion costs (including direct-to-consumer advertising and direct and identifiable out-of-pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as market support, market research, market expansion, a specialty sales force and physician education programs. Certain specified research and development expenses are generally shared equally by Schering-Plough and Merck. The allergy/asthma agreements provided for the joint development and marketing by the companies of a once-daily, fixed-combination tablet containing loratadine/montelukast. In April 2008, the Merck/Schering-Plough joint venture received a not-approvable letter from the FDA for the proposed fixed combination of loratadine/montelukast. During the second quarter of 2008 the respiratory joint venture was terminated in accordance with the agreements. This action has no impact on the cholesterol joint venture. As a result of the 44 Table of Contents termination of the respiratory joint venture, Schering-Plough received payments totaling $105 million, which Schering-Plough recognized during 2008 in equity income. Equity income from the Merck/Schering-Plough joint venture totaled $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 equity income amounts compared to 2007 reflects sales declines of VYTORIN and ZETIA in the U.S. partially offset by sales growth internationally and receipt of $105 million from the termination of the respiratory joint venture. The increase in 2007 equity income as compared to 2006 reflected increased sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA during 2007 as compared to 2006. It should be noted that Schering-Plough incurs substantial selling, general and administrative and other costs, which are not reflected in equity income and instead are included in the overall cost structure of Schering-Plough. Provision for income taxes Tax expense was $146 million, $258 million and $362 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 tax provision amounts included tax benefits of $344 million and $89 million, respectively, related to the amortization of fair values of certain assets acquired as part of the OBS acquisition and other purchase-accounting related items. The tax provisions in 2008, 2007 and 2006 do not include any benefit related to U.S. operating losses. During 2004, Schering-Plough established a valuation allowance on its net U.S. deferred tax assets, including the benefit of U.S. operating losses, as management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the benefit of the U.S. net deferred tax assets can be realized. At December 31, 2008, Schering-Plough continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. Schering-Plough expects to report a U.S. Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward of $1.3 billion on its tax return for the year ended December 31, 2008. This U.S. NOL carryforward could be materially reduced after examination of Schering-Plough’s income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Schering-Plough implemented the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007. As required by FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the interpretation was reported as an adjustment to Schering-Plough’s retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. Schering-Plough reduced its January 1, 2007 retained earnings by $259 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Schering-Plough’s unrecognized tax benefits result primarily from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property) as well as Schering-Plough’s tax matters litigation (see Note 21, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters”, under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”). At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $994 million and $859 million, respectively, which includes tax liabilities as well as reductions to deferred tax assets carrying a full valuation allowance. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $596 million and $535 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease over the next twelve-month period up to approximately $625 million. This would be primarily attributable to a decision in the tax matter currently being litigated in Newark District Court for which a decision has not yet been rendered, possible final resolution of Schering-Plough’s 1997 through 2002 examination by the IRS and appeals and possible resolutions of various other matters. However, the timing of the ultimate resolution of Schering-Plough’s tax matters and the payment and receipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside Schering-Plough’s control. Schering-Plough includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The total amount of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $63 million and $50 million, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $245 million and $197 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities. 45 Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2007, the IRS completed its examination of Schering-Plough’s 1997-2002 federal income tax returns. Schering-Plough is seeking resolution of an issue raised during this examination through the IRS administrative appeals process. In July 2007, Schering-Plough made a payment of $98 million to the IRS pertaining to the 1997-2002 examination. Schering-Plough’s tax returns are open for examination with the IRS for the 1997 through 2008 tax years. During 2008, the IRS commenced its examination of the 2003 — 2006 federal income tax returns. This examination is expected to be completed in 2010. For most of its other significant tax jurisdictions (U.S., state and foreign), Schering-Plough’s income tax returns are open for examination for the period 2000 through 2008. Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders Schering-Plough had a net income/(loss) available to common shareholders of $1.8 billion, $(1.6) billion and $1.1 billion for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders for 2008 and 2007 included approximately $1.1 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, of charges related to purchase accounting for the OBS acquisition, Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders for 2008, 2007 and 2006 included the deduction of preferred stock dividends of $150 million, $118 million and $86 million, respectively, related to the 2004 and 2007 mandatory convertible preferred shares. The loss in 2007 was due to the impact of purchase accounting items from the OBS acquisition and increased interest expense as a result of the issuance of debt in the second half of 2007. These amounts were partially offset by the impacts of a gain on currency options in the 2007 period and a gain on the divestitures of certain Animal Health products in the 2008 period. Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders for 2008, 2007 and 2006 also included special and acquisition-related charges and manufacturing streamlining costs of approximately $329 million, $84 million and $248 million, respectively. See Note 3, “Special and Acquisition-Related Charges and Manufacturing Streamlining,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Discussion of Cash Flow For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 3,364 $ 2,630 $ 2,161 Cash flow used for investing activities (532 ) (13,156 ) (2,908 ) Cash flow (used for)/provided by financing activities (1,660 ) 10,089 (1,361 ) Operating Activities In 2008, operating activities provided $3.4 billion of cash, compared with net cash provided by operations of $2.6 billion in 2007. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of the OBS business and the absence of special and acquisition-related payments in 2007 associated with the settlement of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts involving certain of Schering-Plough’s sales, marketing and clinical trial practices and programs (the Massachusetts Investigation). In 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion as compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to a net realized gain of $510 million from foreign currency options relating to the OBS acquisition, higher net sales and equity income, partially offset by payments of $435 million for the settlement of the Massachusetts Investigation and $98 million for tax and interest due in connection with an examination by the IRS of Schering-Plough’s 1997-2002 federal income tax returns. During 2007, as part of an overall risk management strategy and in consideration of various preliminary financing scenarios associated with the acquisition of OBS, Schering-Plough purchased euro-denominated currency options (derivatives) for aggregate premiums of approximately $165 million and received proceeds of 46 Table of Contents $675 million upon the termination of these options, resulting in a net realized gain of $510 million. These derivatives were short-term (trading) in nature and did not hedge a specific financing or investment transaction. Accordingly, the cash impacts of these derivatives were classified as operating cash flows in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities during 2008 was $532 million and primarily relates to capital expenditures of $747 million partially offset by the proceeds from divested products of $241 million. Net cash used for investing activities in 2007 was $13.2 billion, primarily consisting of $15.8 billion of net cash used to purchase OBS. In addition, the source of cash for investing activities in 2007 included a net reduction of short-term investments of $3.3 billion partially offset by $618 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities during 2006 was $2.9 billion primarily related to the net purchases of short-term investments of $2.4 billion previously invested in cash equivalents and $458 million of capital expenditures. Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities was $1.7 billion for 2008, compared to $10.1 billion of cash provided by financing activities for 2007. Uses of cash for financing activities for 2008 included the pay down of euro-denominated long-term debt of Euro 600 million and other debt payments (total payments $929 million), payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $572 million and pay down of commercial paper and other short-term debt outstanding of $169 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2007 included net proceeds on the issuance of common and preferred shares of approximately $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, and net proceeds of approximately $6.4 billion on the issuance of long-term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 also included $225 million of proceeds from stock option exercises offset by the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $481 million. Net cash used for financing activities during 2006 was $1.4 billion, which included the payment of dividends on common and preferred shares of $412 million and the repayment of $1.0 billion of bank debt and short-term commercial paper borrowings. Other Discussion of Cash Flows Schering-Plough expects to contribute approximately $350 million to its retirement plans during 2009, including approximately $200 million to the U.S. Schering-Plough Retirement Plan. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Schering-Plough had net debt (total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities) of $4.8 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. Cash generated from operations, available cash and short-term investments and available credit facilities are expected to provide Schering-Plough with the ability to fund cash needs for the intermediate term. Borrowings and Credit Facilities On September 17, 2007, Schering-Plough issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00 percent senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.55 percent senior unsecured notes due 2037. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.0 billion. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. The effective interest rate on the 6.00 percent senior unsecured notes and the 6.55 percent senior unsecured notes, which incorporates the initial discount and debt issuance fees, is 6.13 percent and 6.67 percent, respectively. The interest rate payable on these notes is not subject to adjustment. The notes generally restrict Schering-Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 10 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. These notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at Schering-Plough’s option at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100 percent of the principal amount of such notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the 47 Table of Contents remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis using the rate of Treasury Notes with comparable remaining terms plus 25 basis points for the 2017 notes or 30 basis points for the 2037 notes. If a change of control triggering event occurs, under certain circumstances, as defined in the prospectus, holders of the notes will have the right to require Schering-Plough to repurchase all or any part of the notes for a cash payment equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. On October 1, 2007, Schering-Plough issued Euro 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 percent senior unsecured euro-denominated notes due 2010 and Euro 1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375 percent senior unsecured euro-denominated notes due 2014. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.8 billion. Interest on the notes is payable annually. The effective interest rate on the 5.00 percent senior unsecured euro-denominated notes and the 5.375 percent senior unsecured euro-denominated notes, which incorporates the initial discount, debt issuance fees and the impact of interest rate hedges, is 5.10 percent and 5.46 percent, respectively. The interest rate payable on these notes is not subject to adjustment. The notes generally restrict Schering-Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 10 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. These notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at Schering-Plough’s option at any time, at a redemption price specified in the prospectus. If a change of control triggering event occurs, under certain circumstances, as defined in the prospectus, holders of the notes will have the right to require Schering-Plough to repurchase all or any part of the notes for a cash payment equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. Schering-Plough used the net proceeds from these notes to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. On October 24, 2007, Schering-Plough entered into a five-year senior unsecured euro-denominated term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. On October 31, 2007, Schering-Plough drew Euro 1.1 billion ($1.6 billion) on this term loan to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. This term loan has a floating interest rate and requires Schering-Plough to maintain a net debt to total capital ratio of no more than 65 percent through 2009 and 60 percent thereafter, in which net debt equals total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities and total capital equals the sum of total debt and total shareholders’ equity excluding the cumulative effect of acquired in-process research and development in connection with any acquisition consummated after the closing of the term loan. The term loan also generally restricts Schering-Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 12 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. At February 27, 2009, the outstanding balance on the euro-denominated term loan was Euro 450 million. The reported U.S. dollar amounts of the outstanding debt balance and interest expense on the euro-denominated notes and euro-denominated term loan will fluctuate due to the impact of foreign currency translation. On November 26, 2003, Schering-Plough issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3 percent senior unsecured notes due 2013 and $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior unsecured notes due 2033. The interest rates payable on the notes are subject to adjustment. In connection with ratings downgrades in 2004, on December 1, 2004, the interest rate payable on the notes due 2013 increased from 5.3 percent to 5.55 percent, and the interest rate payable on the notes due 2033 increased from 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent. The interest rate payable on a particular series of notes will return to 5.3 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, and the rate adjustment provisions will permanently cease to apply if, the notes are subsequently rated above Baa1 by Moody’s and BBB+ by S&P. If the rating assigned to the notes by either Moody’s or S&P is downgraded below A3 or A-, respectively, the interest rate payable on that series of notes would increase. See Note 15, “Borrowings and Other Commitments,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. On August 9, 2007, Schering-Plough entered into a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and terminated its $1.5 billion credit facility that was due to mature in May 2009. This credit facility has a floating interest rate, matures in August 2012 and requires Schering-Plough to maintain a 48 Table of Contents net debt to total capital ratio of no more than 65 percent through 2009 and 60 percent thereafter, in which net debt equals total debt less cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities and total capital equals the sum of total debt and total shareholders’ equity excluding the cumulative effect of acquired in-process research and development in connection with any acquisition consummated after the closing of the credit facility. The credit facility also generally restricts Schering-Plough from creating or assuming liens or entering into sale and leaseback transactions unless the aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by any such liens and related to any such sale and leaseback transactions does not exceed 12 percent of consolidated net tangible assets. This credit line is available for general corporate purposes and is considered primarily as support to Schering-Plough’s commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under this credit facility may be drawn by the U.S. parent company or by its wholly-owned international subsidiaries when accompanied by a parent guarantee. This facility does not require compensating balances; however, a nominal commitment fee is paid. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, short-term borrowings, including the credit facilities mentioned above, totaled $245 million and $461 million, respectively. There was no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2008. The weighted-average interest rate for short-term borrowings at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 7.1 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively. Schering-Plough’s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes and euro-denominated term loan have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation” (SFAS 52), the foreign currency transaction gains or losses on these euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income. Credit Ratings Schering-Plough’s current unsecured senior credit ratings and outlook are as follows: Long-Term Senior Unsecured Credit Ratings Long-term Short-term Review Status Moody’s Investors Service Baa1 P-2 Stable Standard and Poor’s A− A-2 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB+ F-2 Stable In February 2009, Moody’s Investors Service changed its Long Term Review Status on Schering-Plough’s credit ratings from negative outlook to stable. In August 2008, Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings changed their Long Term Review Status from negative watch to stable. In April 2008, Moody’s Investor Service had changed its Long Term Review Status from stable to negative outlook, and Fitch Ratings changed its Long Term Review Status from stable to negative watch. In March 2008, Standard and Poor’s had changed its Long Term Review Status from stable to negative watch. Schering-Plough paid down its entire commercial paper borrowings of $149 million during 2008. From a cash perspective, Schering-Plough remains invested in highly-liquid and highly-rated securities. Schering-Plough remains focused on the credit markets and continues to closely monitor the broader financial and economic situation. Schering-Plough believes the ability of commercial paper issuers, such as Schering-Plough, with one or more short-term credit ratings of P-2 from Moody’s, A-2 from S&P and/or F-2 from Fitch to issue or rollover outstanding commercial paper can, at times, be less than that of companies with higher short-term credit ratings. Further, the total amount of commercial paper capacity available to these issuers, such as Schering-Plough, is typically less than that of higher-rated companies. In addition, Schering-Plough’s ability to issue commercial paper in the future is dependent on capital market conditions at that time. Schering-Plough’s sizable lines of credit with commercial banks as well as cash and short-term investments held by U.S. and international subsidiaries serve as alternative sources of liquidity. Schering-Plough’s credit ratings could decline below their current levels. The impact of such decline could reduce the availability of commercial paper borrowing and would increase the interest rate on a portion of Schering-Plough’s short and long-term debt. As discussed above, Schering-Plough believes that existing 49 Table of Contents cash and short-term investments, available credit facilities and cash generated from operations will allow Schering-Plough to fund its cash needs for the intermediate term. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock On August 15, 2007, Schering-Plough issued 10,000,000 shares of 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the 2007 Preferred Stock) with a face value of $2.5 billion. Net proceeds to Schering-Plough were approximately $2.4 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. Schering-Plough used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2007 Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. Each share of the 2007 Preferred Stock will automatically convert into between 7.4206 and 9.0909 common shares of Schering-Plough depending on the average closing price of Schering-Plough’s common shares over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the mandatory conversion date of August 13, 2010, as defined in the prospectus. The preferred shareholders may elect to convert at any time prior to August 13, 2010, at the minimum conversion ratio of 7.4206 common shares per share of the 2007 Preferred Stock. Additionally, if at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date the closing price of Schering-Plough’s common shares exceeds $50.53 (for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days), Schering-Plough may elect to cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, of the 2007 Preferred Stock then outstanding at the same minimum conversion ratio of 7.4206 common shares for each share of 2007 Preferred Stock. The 2007 Preferred Stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of 6 percent on shares outstanding. The dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and, to the extent Schering-Plough is legally permitted to pay dividends and the Board of Directors declares a dividend payable, Schering-Plough will pay dividends on each dividend payment date. The dividend payment dates are February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. During the year ended December 31, 2007, all shares of 6 percent Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued on August 10, 2004 (the 2004 Preferred Stock) were converted into 64,584,929 shares of Schering-Plough common stock. Equity Issuance and Treasury Shares On August 15, 2007, Schering-Plough issued 57,500,000 common shares from treasury shares at $27.50 per share. Net proceeds to Schering-Plough were approximately $1.5 billion after deducting commissions, discounts and other underwriting expenses. Schering-Plough used the net proceeds from the sale of the common shares to fund a portion of the purchase price for the OBS acquisition. See Note 2, “Acquisition,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Schering-Plough has various contractual obligations that are reported as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and others that are not required to be recognized as liabilities such as certain purchase 50 Table of Contents commitments and other executory contracts. The following table summarizes payments due by period under Schering-Plough’s known contractual obligations at December 31, 2008. Payments Due by Period 2014 and Total 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 Thereafter (Dollars in millions) Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 245 $ 245 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt obligations 7,931 — 722 1,973 5,236 Interest related to debt obligations 5,568 479 853 794 3,442 Operating lease obligations 558 165 218 99 76 Purchase obligations(1) 2,780 2,601 125 38 16 Deferred compensation plan obligations 153 74 20 25 34 Other obligations(2) 1,506 846 258 200 202 Total $ 18,741 $ 4,410 $ 2,196 $ 3,129 $ 9,006 (1) Purchase obligations include advertising and research contracts, capital expenditure commitments and other inventory and expense items. Potential milestone payments of approximately $2 billion were not included in the contractual obligations table as they are contingent on the achievement of various research and development (approximately $370 million), regulatory approval (approximately $630 million) or sales-based (approximately $1 billion) milestones. Research, development and regulatory milestones depend upon future clinical developments as well as regulatory agency actions which may never occur. Sales-based milestones are contingent on generating levels of sales of current or future products that have not yet been achieved. (2) This caption includes obligations, based on undiscounted amounts, for estimated payments under certain of Schering-Plough’s pension plans, preferred stock dividends, management’s estimate of the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits and other contractual obligations. REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH SCHERING-PLOUGH OPERATES Schering-Plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national, state and local regulatory agencies. The regulations to which Schering-Plough is subject are described in more detail in Part I, Item I, “Business,” of this 10-K. Regulatory compliance is complex, as regulatory standards (including Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices) vary by jurisdiction and are constantly evolving. Regulatory compliance is also costly. Regulatory compliance also impacts the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications. Further, failure to comply with regulations can result in delays in the approval of drugs, seizure or recall of drugs, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production and sale of drugs, fines and other civil or criminal sanctions. Regulatory compliance, and the cost of compliance failures, can have a material impact on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, its cash flows or financial condition. Much is still unknown about the science of human health and with every drug there are benefits and risks. Societal and governmental pressures are constantly shifting between the demand for innovation to meet urgent unmet medical needs and adversity to risk. These pressures impact the regulatory environment and the market for Schering-Plough’s products. Regulatory Compliance and Pharmacovigilance Regulatory Inspections Schering-Plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions, including the U.S., the EU, and the EU member states. The requirements differ from jurisdiction 51 Table of Contents to jurisdiction, but all include requirements for reporting adverse events that occur while a patient is using a particular drug in order to alert the drug’s manufacturer and the governmental agency to potential problems. In February 2006, Schering-Plough began the Global Clinical Harmonization Program for building clinical excellence (in trial design, execution and tracking), which is strengthening Schering-Plough’s scientific and compliance rigor on a global basis. In 2007, certain aspects of the Global Clinical Harmonization Program were implemented, and significant work continued in 2008 and is expected to continue for several years. Schering-Plough intends to continue upgrading skills, processes and systems in clinical practices and pharmacovigilance. Schering-Plough remains committed to accomplish this work and to invest significant resources in this area. Like other pharmaceutical companies, Schering-Plough is subject to inspections by the FDA, the EMEA and other regulatory authorities. Possible actions include demands for improvements in reporting systems, criminal sanctions against Schering-Plough and/or responsible individuals and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering-Plough’s products. Regulatory Compliance and Post-Marketing Surveillance Schering-Plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world. These clinical trial research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by U.S., EU and local country regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with current Good Clinical Practices or other applicable laws or regulations can result in delays in approval of clinical trials, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, delays in approval of marketing authorizations, criminal sanctions against Schering-Plough and/or responsible individuals, financial penalties, and changes in the conditions of marketing authorizations for Schering-Plough’s products. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. In addition, these situations have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general. For the past several years, these occurrences have increased. In 2008, the intense media attention to the results of the ENHANCE clinical trial led to some concerns among patients and prescribers about ZETIA and VYTORIN (see discussion under Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” “Litigation and Investigations relating to the Merck/Schering-Plough Cholesterol Joint Venture”). Following this wave of product withdrawals by other companies and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMEA and the PMDA have continued to increase their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. The FDA, in particular, was granted new legislative authority in 2007 which included several provisions focused on drug safety and pharmacovigilance, including the ability to mandate labeling changes and require post-approval evaluations and studies. In addition, some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re-reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties and potential delays in the regulatory approval processes. There also continues to be significant regulatory and legislative scrutiny, especially in the U.S., on advertising and promotion and in particular direct-to-consumer advertising. Similarly, major health authorities, including the FDA, EMEA and PMDA, have also increased collaboration amongst themselves, especially with regard to the evaluation of safety and benefit/risk information. Media attention has also increased. In the current environment, a health authority regulatory action in one market, such as a safety labeling change, may have regulatory, prescribing and marketing implications in other markets to an extent not previously seen. Some health authorities, such as the PMDA in Japan, have publicly acknowledged a significant backlog in workload due to resource constraints within their agency. This backlog has caused long regulatory review times for new indications and products and has added to the uncertainty in predicting approval timelines in these markets. While the PMDA has committed to correcting the backlog and has made some progress over the last two years, it is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. 52 Table of Contents In the U.S., the new Presidential Administration has announced that health care reform, including regulation of pharmaceutical companies and their products, is a priority. The Administration has not yet named a Health and Human Services Secretary or the FDA Commissioner, who may initiate further change. The impact of such actions, as well as budget pressures on governments in the U.S. and other nations, cannot be predicted at this time. These and other uncertainties inherent in government regulatory approval processes, including, among other things, delays in approval of new products, formulations or indications, may also affect Schering-Plough’s operations. The effect of regulatory approval processes on operations cannot be predicted. Schering-Plough has nevertheless achieved a significant number of important regulatory approvals since 2004, including approvals for VYTORIN, BRIDION (in Europe), NOXAFIL, CLARINEX D-24, CLARINEX REDITABS, CLARINEX D-12, SUBOXONE and new indications for TEMODAR and NASONEX. Other significant approvals since 2004 include ASMANEX DPI (Dry Powder for Inhalation) in the U.S., PEGINTRON, ZETIA, TEMODAR, ESMERON/ESLAX, NASONEX and GANIREST in Japan, and new indications for REMICADE. Schering-Plough also has a number of significant regulatory submissions filed in major markets awaiting approval, including golimumab in Europe, sugammadex in the U.S. and SAPHRIS (asenapine) in the U.S. Schering-Plough’s personnel have regular, open dialogue with the FDA, EMEA and other regulators and review product labels and other materials on a regular basis and as new information becomes known. Pricing Pressures As described more specifically in Note 21, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” the pricing, sales and marketing programs and arrangements, and related business practices of Schering-Plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities. These entities include the Department of Justice and its U.S. Attorney’s Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the FTC and various state Attorneys’ General offices. Many of the health care laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate, including the federal and state anti-kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws, have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion. In the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred, one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings, which, if instituted and resolved unfavorably, could subject Schering-Plough to substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs. Schering-Plough also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales. Any such result could have a material adverse impact on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or its business. In the U.S., many of Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as managed care groups, institutions, government agencies and other groups seek price discounts. For instance, third party payors use formulary restrictions to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for inclusion in the formulary. A change in the formulary status of a product may impact the sales of that product. In the U.S. market, Schering-Plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in Medicaid, the veterans health care program and other government-funded programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for Medicare and has resulted in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of Medicare recipients. In most international markets, Schering-Plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost-containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements; emphasized greater use of generic drugs; and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods to control costs. 53 Table of Contents Since Schering-Plough is unable to predict the final form and timing of any future domestic or international governmental or other health care initiatives, including the passage of laws permitting the importation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S., their effect on operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the effect on operations and cash flows of future decisions of government entities, managed care groups and other groups concerning formularies and pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be reasonably estimated. Competition The market for pharmaceutical products is competitive. Schering-Plough’s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance and generic competition as Schering-Plough’s products mature. In addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products. The effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted. 2009 OUTLOOK Schering-Plough does not provide numeric guidance. However, the following outlook may be helpful to readers in assessing future prospects. Uncertainties in the financial and credit markets, along with generally difficult business conditions, have contributed recently to pressures on companies in the U.S., including pharmaceutical companies. While further development of these economic effects, along with potential for healthcare reforms at the federal or state level in the U.S. are difficult to predict, Schering-Plough plans to remain flexible in managing its business in the face of these challenges. Given the current uncertainties in the cholesterol markets, it remains difficult to predict the long-term performance of the cholesterol franchise. Currently, Schering-Plough believes that 2009 U.S. sales of VYTORIN and ZETIA are expected to be lower than in 2008 while international sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, should continue to grow. For the full year 2009, Schering-Plough currently expects R&D spending to grow in the mid single-digit range. The risks set forth in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this 10-K could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectation provided in this section. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. For calendar-year companies, the standard became effective January 1, 2008 (see Note 17, “Fair Value Measurements” in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) except for non-financial items measured on a non-recurring basis for which it is effective beginning January 1, 2009. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on Schering-Plough’s financial statements. Based on Schering-Plough’s current financial position, the impact of the provisions of this standard that are effective January 1, 2009 is not expected to be material. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS 159), which permits 54 Table of Contents entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 also includes an amendment to SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” which applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. For calendar-year companies, the standard became effective January 1, 2008. Schering-Plough chose not to elect the fair value option prescribed by SFAS 159. As a result, the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on Schering-Plough’s financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07-1, “Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements,” which is effective for calendar-year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The Task Force clarified the manner in which costs, revenues and sharing payments made to, or received by, a partner in a collaborative arrangement should be presented in the income statement and set forth certain disclosures that should be required in the partners’ financial statements. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations,” (SFAS 141R). For calendar-year companies, the standard is applicable to new business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009. SFAS 141R requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Most significantly, SFAS 141R will require that acquisition costs generally be expensed as incurred, certain acquired contingent liabilities be recorded at fair value, and acquired in-process research and development be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date. The standard will also impact certain unresolved matters related to purchase transactions consummated prior to the effective date of the standard. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material, but this standard may have an effect on accounting for future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51,” which is effective for calendar-year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The standard establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,” which is effective for calendar-year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The standard enhances required disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142). FSP 142-3 is effective for calendar-year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The requirement for determining useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent to, the effective date. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This standard identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (the GAAP hierarchy). SFAS No. 162 became effective on November 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on Schering-Plough’s financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF No. 03-6-1, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” The FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two-class method described 55 Table of Contents in SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share.” The FSP requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. The FSP is effective for calendar-year companies beginning January 1, 2009. The impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-3 “Determining Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active” (FSP 157-3). FSP 157-3 clarified the application of SFAS No. 157 in an inactive market. It demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive. FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on Schering-Plough’s financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, “Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interest in Variable Interest Entities.” FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities. The FSP is effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2008. Since the FSP requires only additional disclosures concerning transfers of financial assets and interest in variable interest entities, adoption of this FSP did not affect Schering-Plough’s disclosures. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and estimates are considered significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect Schering-Plough’s financial statements: • Revenue Recognition • Rebates, Discounts and Returns • Provision for Income Taxes • Acquisitions and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property • Accounting for Pensions and Post-retirement Benefit Plans • Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Revenue Recognition Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products are sold to direct purchasers, which include wholesalers, retailers and certain health maintenance organizations. Price discounts and rebates on such sales are paid to federal and state agencies, other indirect purchasers and other market participants such as managed care organizations that indemnify beneficiaries of health plans for their pharmaceutical costs and pharmacy benefit managers. Schering-Plough recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the purchaser and when reliable estimates of the following can be determined: i. commercial discount and rebate arrangements; ii. rebate obligations under certain federal and state governmental programs; and iii. sales returns in the normal course of business. Revenue recognition also requires that there is reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds. When recognizing revenue, Schering-Plough estimates and records the applicable commercial and governmental discounts and rebates as well as sales returns that have been or are expected to be granted or made for products sold during the period. These amounts are deducted from sales for that period. If reliable estimates of these items cannot be made, Schering-Plough defers the recognition of revenue. Estimates recorded in prior periods are re-evaluated as part of this process. 56 Table of Contents Revenue recognition for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including estimated acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics. Absent the ability to make reliable estimates of rebates, discounts and returns, Schering-Plough would defer revenue recognition. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with wholesalers, managed care organizations and government purchasers and certain other market conditions. Rebates are estimated based on sales and contract terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Schering-Plough evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of third party demand and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Data and information provided by purchasers and obtained from third parties are subject to inherent limitations as to their accuracy and validity. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information, consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition including expected generic introductions, or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the formulation of return reserves. Schering-Plough’s agreements with the major U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers address a number of commercial issues, such as product returns, timing of payment, processing of chargebacks and the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers. With respect to the quantity of inventory held by these wholesalers, these agreements provide a financial disincentive for these wholesalers to acquire quantities of product in excess of what is necessary to meet current patient demand. Through the use of these agreements, Schering-Plough expects to avoid situations where Schering-Plough’s shipments of product are not reflective of current demand. Rebates, Discounts and Returns Schering-Plough’s rebate accruals for Federal and State governmental programs, including Medicaid and Medicare Part D, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were $162 million and $114 million, respectively. Commercial discounts, returns and other rebate accruals at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were $373 million and $412 million, respectively. These accruals are established in the period the related revenue was recognized, resulting in a reduction to sales and the establishment of liabilities, which are included in total current liabilities, or in the case of returns and other receivable adjustments, an allowance provided against accounts receivable. In the case of the governmental rebate programs, Schering-Plough’s payments involve interpretations of relevant statutes and regulations. These interpretations are subject to challenges and changes in interpretive guidance by governmental authorities. The result of such a challenge or change could affect whether the estimated governmental rebate amounts are ultimately sufficient to satisfy Schering-Plough’s obligations. Additional information on governmental inquiries focused in part on the calculation of rebates is contained in Note 21, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, it is possible that, as a result of governmental challenges or changes in interpretive guidance, actual rebates could materially differ from amounts accrued. 57 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued rebates, sales returns and discounts: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, Beginning of Period $ 526 $ 486 OBS’s accruals acquired November 19, 2007 — 63 Provision for Rebates 759 609 Adjustment to prior-year estimates (7 ) (31 ) Payments (720 ) (569 ) 32 9 Provision for Returns 143 142 Purchase-accounting adjustments(1) (9 ) — Adjustment to prior-year estimates (4 ) (24 ) Returns (146 ) (137 ) (16 ) (19 ) Provision for Discounts 897 752 Adjustment to prior-year estimates (6 ) (2 ) Discounts granted (898 ) (763 ) (7 ) (13 ) Accrued Rebates/Returns/Discounts, End of Period $ 535 $ 526 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2008, purchase accounting adjustments reflect $9 million related to the reversal of return reserves recorded as part of the purchase accounting for OBS. This reversal was recorded as a reduction to goodwill. In formulating and recording the above accruals, management utilizes assumptions and estimates that include historical experience, wholesaler data, the projection of market conditions, the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate, utilization estimates, and forecasted product demand amounts as discussed under the critical accounting policy entitled “Revenue Recognition.” As part of its review of these accruals, management performs a sensitivity analysis that considers differing assumptions, which are most subject to judgment in its rebate accrual calculation. Based upon Schering-Plough’s sensitivity analysis, reasonably possible changes to assumptions related to rebate accruals could favorably or unfavorably impact 2009 net sales and income before taxes in an annual amount consistent with prior years. This sensitivity analysis excludes the potential impacts of a specific matter that involves interpretations of statutes and could have a favorable impact on net sales and income before taxes in future periods. Provision for Income Taxes Schering-Plough implemented the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (FIN 48) as of January 1, 2007. As required by FIN 48, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the interpretation was reported as an adjustment to Schering-Plough’s retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2007. Schering-Plough reduced its January 1, 2007, retained earnings by $259 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Schering-Plough’s unrecognized tax benefits result primarily from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations and include exposures on intercompany terms of cross border arrangements and utilization of cash held by foreign subsidiaries (investment in U.S. property) as well as Schering-Plough’s tax 58 Table of Contents matters litigation (see Note 21, “Legal, Environmental and Regulatory Matters” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”). At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $994 million and $859 million, respectively, which includes tax liabilities as well as reductions to deferred tax assets carrying a full valuation allowance. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $596 million and $535 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease over the next twelve-month period up to approximately $625 million. This would be primarily attributable to a decision in the tax matter currently being litigated in Newark District Court for which a decision has not yet been rendered, possible final resolution of Schering-Plough’s 1997 through 2002 examination by the IRS and appeals and possible resolutions of various other matters. However, the timing of the ultimate resolution of Schering-Plough’s tax matters and the payment and receipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside Schering-Plough’s control. Schering-Plough includes interest expense or income as well as potential penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The total amount of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $63 million and $50 million, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $245 million and $197 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities. Acquisitions and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Property Schering-Plough accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the asset. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations. Useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset, which considers various characteristics of the asset, including projected cash flows. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level based on a two-step approach. First, the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value as estimated by the future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a second step would be performed, whereby the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities are fair valued. To the extent that the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment exists and would be recognized. Intangible assets representing the capitalized costs of purchased goodwill, patents, licenses and other forms of intellectual property totaled $8.9 billion and $9.9 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Intangible assets and goodwill increased significantly during 2007 due to the acquisition of OBS. Annual amortization expense in each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $570 million per year based on the intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2008. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty. For example, if a marketed pharmaceutical product were to be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons or if marketing of a product could only occur with pronounced warnings, amounts capitalized for such a product may need to be reduced due to impairment. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Management regularly reviews intangible assets for possible impairment. Certain of Schering-Plough’s manufacturing sites operate below capacity. Overall costs of operating manufacturing sites have significantly increased over the past several years due to compliance activities. Schering-Plough’s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed. Actions on the part of management to 59 Table of Contents significantly reduce Schering-Plough’s manufacturing infrastructure involve complex issues. As a result, shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements, including revalidation and registration requirements. Management continues to review the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets for indications of impairment. Future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments and/or related costs. Accounting for Pension and Post-retirement Benefit Plans Pension and other post-retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions. Schering-Plough assesses its pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, Schering-Plough considers many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, Schering-Plough’s historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations (see Note 9, “Retirement Plans and Other Post-retirement Benefits,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information). Discount rates used for pension and other post-retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high-quality fixed income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. In countries where debt instruments are thinly traded, estimates are based on available market rates. Actuarial assumptions are based upon management’s best estimates and judgment. With other assumptions held constant, an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated favorable impact of $52 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost and an increase of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated favorable impact of $17 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost. With other assumptions held constant, a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $52 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost, and a decrease of 50 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated unfavorable impact of $17 million on net pension and post-retirement benefit cost. These sensitivities are based on estimated net pension and post-retirement benefit cost in 2008 which includes the annual impact of OBS’s plans. The expected rates of return for the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans represent the average rates of return to be earned on plan assets over the period during which the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, Schering-Plough determines expected returns for each of the major asset classes, principally equities, fixed income and real estate. The return expectations for these asset classes are based on assumptions for economic growth and inflation, which are supported by long-term historical data as well as Schering-Plough’s actual experience of return on plan assets. The expected portfolio performance also reflects active management as appropriate. During 2008, conditions in the worldwide debt and equity markets deteriorated significantly. These conditions have had a negative effect on the fair value of plan assets. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Expected returns are based primarily on a calculated market-related value of assets. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from Schering-Plough’s expected returns for the majority of the assets are realized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. Total unrecognized net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net pension and other post-retirement benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. Schering-Plough’s practice is to fund qualified pension plans at least at sufficient amounts to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable laws. Schering-Plough expects to contribute approximately $350 million to its retirement plans during 2009, including approximately $200 million to the U.S. Schering-Plough Retirement Plan. 60 Table of Contents The targeted investment portfolio of Schering-Plough’s U.S. Retirement Plan is allocated 65 percent to equities; 29 percent to fixed income investments; and 6 percent to real estate. The targeted investment portfolio of Schering-Plough’s U.S. other post-retirement benefit plan is allocated 70 percent to equities and 30 percent to fixed income investments. The portfolios’ equity weightings are consistent with the long-term nature of the plans’ benefit obligations. For non-U.S. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local governmental rules and regulations. Substantially all investments in equities and fixed income are valued based on quoted public market values. All investments in real estate are valued based on periodic appraisals. Accounting for Legal and Regulatory Matters Management judgments and estimates are required in the accounting for legal and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis including insurance coverages. Schering-Plough reviews the status of all claims, investigations and legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. From time to time, Schering-Plough may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions management believes are in the best interests of Schering-Plough. Resolution of any or all claims, investigations and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Schering-Plough’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE Schering-Plough is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, from interest rates and equity prices. The following describes the nature of these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Schering-Plough has subsidiaries in more than 55 countries. In 2008, sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 70 percent of global sales. Virtually all these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country. As such, Schering-Plough’s reported sales, profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates. To date, management has not deemed it cost effective to engage in a formula-based program of hedging the profits and cash flows of international operations using derivative financial instruments. Because Schering-Plough’s international subsidiaries purchase significant quantities of inventory payable in U.S. dollars, managing the level of inventory and related payables and the rate of inventory turnover can provide a level of protection against adverse changes in exchange rates. The risk of adverse exchange rate change is also mitigated by the fact that Schering-Plough’s international operations are widespread. The net assets of most of Schering-Plough’s international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation account as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity. For the remaining international subsidiaries, non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using historical rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates, with the U.S. dollar effects of rate changes included in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. On occasion, Schering-Plough has used derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures. During 2007, as part of an overall risk management strategy and in consideration of various preliminary financing scenarios associated with the acquisition of OBS, Schering-Plough purchased euro-denominated currency options to mitigate its exposure in the event there was a significant strengthening in the Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. Schering-Plough purchased the options for aggregate premiums of approximately $165 million and received proceeds of $675 million upon the termination of these options, resulting in a net realized gain of $510 million. These derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS 133). Accordingly, the gain on these derivatives were recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no open foreign currency option contracts. 61 Table of Contents Schering-Plough’s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes and euro-denominated term loan have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. In accordance with SFAS 52, the foreign currency transaction gains or losses on these euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Financial assets exposed to changes in interest rates and/or equity prices are primarily cash equivalents, short-term investments and the debt and equity securities held in non-qualified trusts for employee benefits. These assets totaled more than $3.4 billion at December 31, 2008. For cash equivalents and short-term investments, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have decreased interest income by approximately $6 million in 2008. For securities held in qualified and non-qualified trusts, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities that these trust assets will fund, Schering-Plough’s exposure to market risk is deemed to be low. Financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates are primarily short-term borrowings and the long-term floating-rate euro-denominated term loan. Schering-Plough has long-term fixed rate debt outstanding, on which a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the debt at December 31, 2008, by approximately $135 million. During 2007, Schering-Plough executed a series of interest rate swaps in anticipation of financing the acquisition of OBS. The objective of the swaps was to hedge the interest rate payments to be made on future issuances of debt. As such, the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of future interest payments, and in accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion was reported in operations. In connection with the euro-denominated debt issuances as described in Note 15, “Borrowings and Other Commitments,” under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” portions of the swaps were deemed ineffective, and Schering-Plough recognized a $7 million loss in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The effective portion of the swaps of $12 million was recorded in other comprehensive income in 2007 and is being recognized as interest expense over the life of the related debt. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no open interest rate swaps.

The Company’s competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic drug manufacturers, and animal health care companies. The Company’s operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the Company’s products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors’ branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products.Pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. With its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the Company is well-positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. The Company is active in acquiring and 5Table of Contentsmarketing products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for the Company’s products in that therapeutic category.The highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the Company’s products as well as competitors’ products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.Health Care Environment and Government RegulationGlobal efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform enacted in prior years, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company’s sales performance in 2022 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. In the U.S., the Biden Administration and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect sales and profits.United StatesThe Company faces increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profit margins, including, through (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American Rescue Plan Act), and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act).In the U.S., federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. For example, federal and state laws require the Company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain state and federal entities such as the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.Additionally in the U.S., consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Merck’s products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been increasing the cost-sharing required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. As the U.S. payor market concentrates further, the Company may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors.In order to provide information about the Company’s pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing Transparency Report for the U.S. The report provides the Company’s average annual list price, net price increases, and average discounts across the Company’s U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2022, the Company’s gross U.S. sales were reduced by 39.7% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns. Legislative ChangesIn 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of 6Table of Contentsthe liability for certain drug benefits, and government price-setting for certain Medicare Part D drugs, starting in 2026, and Medicare Part B drugs starting in 2028. The long-term implications of the Inflation Reduction Act remain uncertain and subject to various factors, including the manner in which U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decides to implement the statute. Many experts and analysts, both within the industry and outside, have predicted that the law will harm innovation in the pharmaceutical industry and result in fewer new treatments being developed and approved over time. Merck is working to mitigate the potentially harmful effects that the law could have on innovation. In addition, in 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. These rebates act as a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer discounts paid to Medicaid can increase. Prior to this change, manufacturers have not been required to pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) in rebates to state Medicaid programs for Medicaid-covered drugs. As a result of this provision, beginning in 2024, it is possible that manufacturers may have to pay state Medicaid programs more in rebates than they received on sales of particular products. This change could present a risk to Merck in the future for drugs that have high Medicaid utilization and rebate exposure that is more than 100% of the AMP.The Company also faces increasing pricing pressure in the states, which are looking to exert greater influence over the price of prescription drugs. A number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other financial data to the state. Some laws also require manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. The Company expects that states will continue their focus on pharmaceutical pricing and will increasingly shift to more aggressive price control tools such as Prescription Drug Affordability Boards that have the authority to conduct affordability reviews and establish upper payment limits.Regulatory ChangesIn November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General issued a Final Rule that would have, effective January 1, 2023, eliminated the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to PBMs on behalf of such plans. Congress has delayed implementation of this Final Rule until January 1, 2026 and pending federal legislation would repeal it entirely. While the Company cannot anticipate the effects of this change to the way it currently contracts, this new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans. This rulemaking also established, effective January 1, 2021, a new safe harbor for point of sale discounts at the pharmacy counter and a new safe harbor for certain service arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs. The pharmaceutical industry also could be considered a potential source of savings via other legislative and administrative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls. European UnionEfforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in the European Union (EU). The Company faces competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs. Reference pricing may either compare a product’s prices in other markets (external reference pricing), or compare a product’s price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing). The authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the Company’s drugs. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations. Some EU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit control plans. Others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In some EU Member States, cross-border imports from low-priced markets also exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State.Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement plans vary widely from Member State to Member State. Some EU Member States provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapies or so-called health technology assessments (HTA), in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The HTA of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in 7Table of Contentsmost EU Member States. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public health impact, therapeutic impact and/or the economic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the individual country in which it is conducted. Ultimately, HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. The outcome of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of the Company’s products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force the Company to reduce its reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates. A negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine the Company’s ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, to inform their pricing and reimbursement decisions. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, the Company may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of the Company’s product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of the Company’s products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.JapanIn Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. In addition, if a Merck product has the same medical action or composition of another product that is subject to market expansion re-pricing, the Merck product could also be subject to re-pricing unless it meets exception criteria. The next government-mandated price reduction will occur in April 2023.ChinaThe Company’s business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to the Company’s overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of the Company’s business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the Company’s current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the government’s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. In 2021, drugs were added to the NRDL with an average of more than 60% price reductions. A new NRDL was recently completed in which new entries averaged 60% price reductions. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume based procurement (VBP). In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into the last five rounds of VBP had, on average, a price reduction of more than 50%. The Company expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward.Emerging MarketsThe Company’s focus on emerging markets, in addition to China, has continued. Governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine. The Company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in the emerging markets.Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the Company’s efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, credit worthiness of health care partners, such as hospitals, and other 8Table of Contentsdevelopments that may adversely impact the business environment for the Company. Further, the Company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the Company’s risk exposure.In addressing global cost containment pressures, the Company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. The Company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the Company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens’ access to appropriate health care, including medicines.Operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the Company’s business, the Company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well-positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.RegulationThe pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement.Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S., which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the U.S. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the “breakthrough therapy” designation, which has accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner.The EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU Member States. In particular, EU regulators may approve products subject to a number of post-authorization conditions. Examples of typical post-authorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, the establishment of patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribing arrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the imposition of financial penalties. The Company’s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company’s business.The Company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. (See “Research and Development” below for a discussion of the regulatory approval process.)Access to MedicinesAs a global health care company, Merck’s primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. The Company also recognizes that, in collaboration with key stakeholders, it has a role to play in helping to ensure that its science advances health care, and its products are accessible and affordable. The Company is committed to ensuring a reliable, safe global supply of its quality medicines and vaccines, and to developing, testing and implementing innovative solutions that address barriers to access and affordability of its medicines and vaccines. The Company’s approach is designed to enable it to serve the greatest number of patients today, while meeting the needs of patients in the future. The Company’s efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the Company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the Company’s worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. The Company systematically evaluates its pipeline candidates to identify potential to address significant public health burden and unmet medical needs in underserved health care settings. Products continue to be evaluated for their potential throughout their life cycle to account for changes in the external environment. The Company also collaborates with different stakeholders, 9Table of Contentsincluding private, governmental, multilateral and non-profit organizations, to design and deliver sustainable solutions to help address access challenges at the payer, provider and patient levels. In addition, through innovative social investments, including philanthropic programs and impact investing, Merck is helping to strengthen health systems and build capacity, particularly in under-resourced communities. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides certain medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the U.S. who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the Company’s assistance, cannot afford their Merck medicines and vaccines. Globally, Merck has made substantial contributions to access to health through key initiatives, including product donations for humanitarian assistance in low-income countries through the Medical Outreach Program. The Mectizan Donation Program, the longest running disease-specific drug donation program of its kind, supports the elimination of two neglected tropical diseases – onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Additionally, through Merck for Mothers the Company provides funding, and scientific and business acumen to help global health partners end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Merck has also provided funds to the Merck Foundation, an independent grantmaking organization, which supports a variety of organizations dedicated to addressing systemic barriers to health equity.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe Company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on the Company’s ability to transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the Company’s business, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue. The GDPR and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States govern the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that the Company processes. It also imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (which includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Further, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of data protection, including to the U.S., except if the data controller meets very specific requirements. Following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the EU in 2020, there is considerable uncertainty as to the permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. In light of the implications of this decision, the Company may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries. Since then, the Company diligently entered into the EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses with its vendors, suppliers, collaboration partners and clinical trial sites in order to facilitate the lawful transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. In addition, President Biden issued an Executive Order on October 7, 2022 to address the data privacy concerns raised in the Schrems II decision through introducing, among other measures, further safeguards and oversight of personal data collection by U.S. signals intelligence activities and providing individuals with a redress mechanism in the U.S. for their data protection concerns. Further certainty for the international transfer of personal data from the EU via the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (successor to the invalidated EU-U.S. Privacy Shield) may come by way of a new EU Adequacy Decision, issued in draft form by the EU Commission on December 13, 2022 and expected to come into force in mid-2023. However, it remains likely that such a new Adequacy Decision will be contested by privacy advocates and be subject to legal review.Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both the EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised.There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against the Company, harm to its reputation, and adversely impact its business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between 10Table of Contentsdifferent regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that the Company faces with regard to data protection regulation.In August 2021, China passed the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) that aims to standardize the handling of personal information in China which became effective in November 2021. The PIPL currently applies to the processing of personal information of natural persons in China, the processing of personal information outside China where the purpose is to provide products and services in China, and to analyze the activities of individuals in China. While similar to the GDPR, the PIPL contains unique requirements not found in the GDPR.The Company has developed and implemented comprehensive plans to ensure compliance with the PIPL, with those relating to data localization and cross-border transfers yet to be completed pending forthcoming guidance from the Cyberspace Administration of China.Additional laws and regulations enacted in the U.S. (such as comprehensive data protection acts in California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut), Canada, Europe, Asia, and Latin America, have increased enforcement and litigation activity in the U.S. and other developed markets, as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. The Company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving requirements and risks and to facilitate the transfer of personal information across international borders.DistributionThe Company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, PBMs and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company’s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of the Company’s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed care organizations. The Company sells its animal health products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.Patents, Trademarks and LicensesPatent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company’s marketing of its products in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se, pharmaceutical formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of products, or the uses of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the U.S. for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. Current U.S. patent law provides additional patent term for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by the FDA. The EU also provides an additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product’s Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). Japan provides the additional term for pediatric studies attached to market exclusivity unrelated to patent term.11Table of ContentsPatent portfolios developed for products introduced by the Company normally provide market exclusivity. The Company has the following key patent protection in the U.S., the EU, Japan and China (including the potential for patent term extensions (PTE) and SPCs where indicated) for the following marketed products:ProductYear of Expiration (U.S.)Year of Expiration (EU)(1)Year of Expiration (Japan)(2)Year of Expiration (China)JanuviaExpired(3)Expired2025-2026ExpiredJanumetExpired(3)ExpiredN/AExpiredJanumet XRExpired(3)N/AN/AExpiredIsentress202420232023-2026(4)ExpiredSimponiN/A(5)2024(6)N/A(5)N/A(5)Lenvima(7)2025(8)2026(8) (SPCs)2026ExpiredBridion2026(8)20232024ExpiredBravecto2026 (with pending PTE)2025 (patents), 2029 (SPCs)20292025Gardasil2028ExpiredExpiredN/AGardasil 920282025 (patents), 2030(8) (SPCs)N/A2025Keytruda202820312032-20332028Lynparza(9)2028(8) (with pending PTE)2024 (patents), 2029(8) (SPCs)2028-20292024Zerbaxa2028(8)2023 (patents), 2028(8) (SPCs)2028 N/AAdempas(10)N/A(11)2028(8)2027-20282023Belsomra2029N/A2031N/APrevymis2029(8) (with pending PTE)2024 (patents), 2029(8) (SPCs)20292024Verquvo(10)2035 (with pending PTE)N/A(12)N/A(12)N/A(12)Vaxneuvance2031 (with pending PTE)No PatentNo PatentN/ADelstrigo2032 (with pending PTE)2031 (patents), 2033 (SPCs)N/A2031Pifeltro2032 (with pending PTE)2031 (patents), 2033 (SPCs)20362031Recarbrio2033(8) (with pending PTE)2029 (patents), 2034 (SPCs)2034 (with pending PTE)N/AWelireg2035 (with pending PTE)N/AN/AN/ANote: Compound patent unless otherwise noted.
