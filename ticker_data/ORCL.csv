1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. 27 Table of Contents Business Overview We are the world’s largest enterprise software company. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software as well as applications software designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations. We believe our internal, or organic, growth and continued innovation with respect to our software products and services offerings provide the foundation for our long-term strategic plan. We invest billions of dollars in research and development each year to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products, features and services. Our internally developed offerings have been enhanced by our acquisitions. We are organized into two businesses, software and services, which are further divided into five operating segments. Each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our five operating segments follows. Software Business Our software business, which represented 81%, 80% and 79% of our total revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software license revenues and (2) software license updates and product support revenues. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software business revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our products, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and due to our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software Licenses: We license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. The growth in new software license revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software products, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. Our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period (as provided in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q) provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business. New software license revenues represented 31%, 34% and 33% of our total revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our new software license margins have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs are predominantly fixed in the short term. However, our new software license margins have been and will continue to be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies that we have acquired. Competition in the software business is intense. Our goal is to maintain a first or second position in each of our software product categories and certain industry segments as well as to grow our software revenues faster than our competitors. We believe that the features and functionality of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. We have focused on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products by improving integration, decreasing installation times, lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use. In addition, our broad portfolio of product offerings (many of which have been acquired in recent years) helps us to offer customers the ability to gain efficiencies by consolidating their IT “software stack” with a single vendor, which reduces the number of disparate software vendors with which customers interact. Reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides our customers with a higher return on their IT investments, which we believe creates more demand for our products and services and provides us with a competitive advantage. We have also continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our software products and service levels. We believe this will lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve our goal of becoming our customers’ leading technology advisor. 28 Table of Contents Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period, as well as technical support assistance. In addition, we offer Oracle Unbreakable Linux Support, which provides enterprise level support for the Linux operating system, and also offer support for our Oracle VM server virtualization software. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews its support contracts, (2) the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses, and (3) the amount of support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 50%, 46% and 46% of our total revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Support margins during fiscal 2009 were 84%, and accounted for 81% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license update and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: • substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal; • substantially all of our customers purchase license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our support contract base. Even if new software license revenue growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions add to our support contract base; and • our acquisitions have increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported. We record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business acquisitions to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of $243 million, $179 million and $212 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. To the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, On Demand and education. Our services business, which represented 19%, 20% and 21% of our total revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, has significantly lower margins than our software business. Consulting: Our consulting line of business provides services to customers in business/IT strategy alignment; business process simplification; solution integration; and product implementation, enhancements, and upgrades of our database, middleware and applications software. The amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag software revenue recognition by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Our consulting revenues are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of new software license sales, particularly our application product sales. To the extent we are able to grow our new software license revenues, in particular our application product revenues, we would also generally expect to be able to grow our consulting revenues. On Demand: On Demand includes Oracle On Demand and our Advanced Customer Services offerings. We believe that our On Demand offerings provide our customers flexibility in how they manage their IT environments and an additional opportunity to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive 29 Table of Contents advantage. Recently, we have grown the base of customers that have purchased our On Demand services and to the extent we are able to continue this trend, we would expect our On Demand revenues and margins to increase. We have made and plan to continue to make investments in our On Demand business to support current and future revenue growth, which historically has negatively impacted On Demand margins and may do so in the future. Education: The purpose of our education services is to further the adoption and usage of our software products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our software revenues. Education revenues are impacted by general economic conditions, personnel reductions in our customers’ information technology departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions. We believe the recent global economic environment has unfavorably affected customer demand for our education services in comparison to prior years, which has negatively impacted our revenues and margins. Acquisitions An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. On April 19, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun), a provider of enterprise computing systems, software and services. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, our wholly owned subsidiary will merge with and into Sun and Sun will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle. Upon the consummation of the merger, each share of Sun common stock will be converted into the right to receive $9.50 in cash. In addition, options to acquire Sun common stock, Sun restricted stock unit awards and other equity-based awards denominated in shares of Sun common stock outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger will generally be converted into options, restricted stock unit awards or other equity-based awards, as the case may be, denominated in shares of Oracle common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. The estimated total purchase price of Sun is approximately $7.4 billion. This transaction is subject to Sun stockholder approval, regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions, and other customary closing conditions. We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our existing debt capacity, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations 30 Table of Contents • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation • Allowances for Doubtful Accounts In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed the below critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition We derive revenues from the following sources: (1) software, which includes new software license and software license updates and product support revenues, and (2) services, which include consulting, On Demand and education revenues. New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software, and exclude revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support. While the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenue when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support, which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers. Software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers purchase both software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in SOP 97-2. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the 31 Table of Contents customer. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions, then new software license revenues are generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees; (2) where services include significant modification or customization of the software; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. On Demand is comprised of Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer Services. Oracle On Demand provides multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database, middleware and applications software delivered at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or customer facilities. Advanced Customer Services provide customers with solution lifecycle management services, database and application management services, industry-specific solution support centers and remote and on-site expert services. Revenues from On Demand services are recognized over the term of the service period, which is generally one year. Education revenues include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by “vendor specific objective evidence.” Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately, and for software license updates and product support services is also measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer. We may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results. For software license arrangements that include hardware, software and services, and the software is more than incidental to the multiple element arrangement, but not essential to the functionality of the hardware, we apply the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software, which allows the non-software elements and related services to be accounted for pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (Topic 13), and EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, and the software license and related services to be accounted for pursuant to SOP 97-2. We defer revenues for any undelivered elements, and recognize revenues when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed, in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for each such element. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements, we defer revenues until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance 32 Table of Contents terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software licenses and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to credit worthy customers through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. We account for the sale of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have licensed our software to these same companies (Concurrent Transaction). Software license agreements that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any software license transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length, and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize new software license revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations Fiscal 2009 and Prior Periods In accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, support obligations assumed, estimated restructuring liabilities and pre-acquisition contingencies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; 33 Table of Contents • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $243 million, $179 million and $212 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year. Had we included costs for our estimated selling and research and development activities and the associated margin for unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided under our assumed support arrangements, the fair values of the support obligations would have been significantly higher than what we had recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount of software license updates and product support revenues both historically and in future periods related to these assumed support arrangements. Other significant estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management, but are generally subject to refinement during the purchase price allocation period (generally within one year of the acquisition date). To estimate restructuring expenses, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan. Decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with pre-merger activities of the companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period and as operating expenses thereafter. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies. If, during the purchase price allocation period, we are able to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation. If, as of the end of the purchase price allocation period, we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated. Through fiscal 2009, after the end of the purchase price allocation period, any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre-acquisition contingency, with the exception of unresolved income tax matters, were included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment was determined. 34 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 In fiscal 2010, we will adopt FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. For any business combination that is consummated pursuant to Statement 141(R), including our proposed acquisition of Sun described above, we will recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally at their acquisition date fair values as defined by FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of fair value will require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, with respect to intangible assets acquired, support obligations assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies. The assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair values of these items will be substantially similar upon our adoption of Statement 141(R) as they were under Statement 141 (see above). The below discussion lists those areas of Statement 141(R) that we believe, upon our adoption, require us to apply additional, significant estimates and assumptions. Upon our adoption of Statement 141(R), any changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions will be recorded in current period income tax expense, unless any such changes are identified during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination) and relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Our estimates for the ultimate outcome of income tax matters are based on the best information available to us as of the acquisition date and corresponding measurement period. Additional information may become available subsequent to the acquisition date and corresponding measurement period, which may require us to revise our estimates for these income tax matters. Such estimate revisions that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments will be recorded to our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations in the period the revision is made and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Upon our adoption of Statement 141(R), we will account for one-time termination and exit costs associated with prospective acquisitions pursuant to FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to incur a liability pursuant to Statement 146, our management must have established and approved a plan of restructuring in sufficient detail. A liability for a cost associated with involuntary termination benefits is recorded when benefits have been communicated and a liability for a cost to terminate an operating lease or other contract are incurred when the contract has been terminated in accordance with the contract terms or we have ceased using the right conveyed by the contract, such as vacating a leased facility. Statement 146 requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our estimated liabilities and may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. In addition, the recognition of liabilities pursuant to Statement 146 are subject to certain criteria being met, such as the communication of benefits to be paid to employees and the cessation of benefits received under existing contracts, amongst others. These criteria can cause variability in the timing of recognition of restructuring liabilities, which could cause us to incur expenses in periods we had not expected and could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. If the initial accounting for a business combination that is accounted for pursuant to Statement 141(R) is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, we will report the provisional amounts for such items in our consolidated financial statements. During the measurement period, we will adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and record those adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant will be applied retrospectively to comparative information in our consolidated financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation, amortization, or other income effects recognized in the initial accounting. Identifying changes to the initial accounting requires our 35 Table of Contents management to apply judgment in determining whether the subsequent information received relates to facts and circumstances that existed for the provisional items as of the acquisition date, including information that affects the estimated amounts involved. To the extent significant measurement period adjustments are identified, the comparative financial information we present for a reporting period could be materially revised in comparison to that which we had previously presented in our earnings releases and related filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our adoption of Statement 141(R) in fiscal 2010 will also change how we account for certain other areas of business combinations in comparison to how these areas are currently accounted for pursuant to Statement 141 and related accounting guidance, including the expensing of direct transaction costs. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The provisions of Statement 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, did not result in an impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2008 or 2007. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and 36 Table of Contents segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the U.S. are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the U.S. and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could impact our effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We account for our uncertain tax issues pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. As a part of our accounting for business combinations, some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. As described in the “Business Combinations” section above, through fiscal 2009, income tax contingencies that exist as of the acquisition date for an acquired company are evaluated quarterly and any changes are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. For fiscal 2010, we will make our best estimate of income tax contingencies that we 37 Table of Contents assumed from our legacy acquisitions, and that we will assume from any future acquisitions, as of the acquisition date and during the related measurement period and we will reassess our estimates quarterly. Subsequent to the measurement period, adjustments to these income tax contingencies will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. In addition, we have applied certain of the provisions of the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (Topic 14), as amended, in our accounting for Statement 123(R). We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures upon historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. As required by Statement 123(R), we recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments issued or assumed after June 1, 2006 that are expected to vest. For all share-based payments granted or assumed beginning June 1, 2006, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. The fair value of the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to June 1, 2006 is recognized over the remaining service period using the accelerated expense attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates. Stock-based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider, each quarter, whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of our publicly traded, longest-term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate was zero prior to our first dividend declaration in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as we did not historically pay cash dividends on our common stock and did not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future for grants issued prior to this declaration date. For grants issued subsequent to this dividend 38 Table of Contents declaration date, we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair value of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. Our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method as prescribed under FASB Staff Position FAS 123R-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded, longest-term options or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates, amongst other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends. If the historical data we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of BEA Systems, Inc. in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily impacted by our acquisition of Hyperion Solutions Corporation in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and our acquisition of BEA in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues and to the growth in software license updates and product support revenues for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date. We also present supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains. Although certain revenue and expense contributions from our acquisitions are quantifiable, we are unable to identify the following: • the contribution of the significant majority of our services revenues from acquired companies in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 as the significant majority of these services had been fully integrated into our existing operations; and 39 Table of Contents • the contribution of the significant majority of the expenses associated with acquired products and services in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 as the significant majority of these expenses had been fully integrated into our existing operations. We caution readers that the contribution from BEA products, which already have been integrated with Oracle’s Fusion Middleware and are sold together, to our total database and middleware revenues during fiscal 2009 are based on our internal allocations that have been applied consistently. We further caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends, the information has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to our sales force integration efforts, in particular the effect of having a single sales force offer similar products. We believe that if our sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; • our acquisitions in the periods presented did not result in our entry into a new line of business or product category—therefore, we provided multiple products with substantially similar features and functionality; and • although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, amounts shown as support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains (see below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the rates in effect on May 31, 2008, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.39 million in fiscal 2009 (using 1.39 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.57 million in fiscal 2008 (using 1.57 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2009 results using the fiscal 2008 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 40 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 Actual Constant 2008 Actual Constant 2007 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 11,900 5% 8% $ 11,330 20% 18% $ 9,460 EMEA(1) 7,948 0% 11% 7,945 32% 20% 6,037 Asia Pacific(2) 3,404 8% 13% 3,155 26% 18% 2,499 Total revenues 23,252 4% 10% 22,430 25% 19% 17,996 Total Operating Expenses 14,931 2% 7% 14,586 21% 17% 12,022 Total Operating Margin $ 8,321 6% 15% $ 7,844 31% 22% $ 5,974 Total Operating Margin % 36% 35% 33% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 51% 51% 53% EMEA(1) 34% 35% 34% Asia Pacific 15% 14% 13% Total Revenues by Business: Software $ 18,877 6% 12% $ 17,843 26% 19% $ 14,211 Services 4,375 -5% 1% 4,587 21% 15% 3,785 Total revenues $ 23,252 4% 10% $ 22,430 25% 19% $ 17,996 % Revenues by Business: Software 81% 80% 79% Services 19% 20% 21% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) Asia Pacific includes Japan Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Our operating results for fiscal 2009 were significantly impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major international currencies. These currency variances resulted in a reduction to our total revenues growth of 6 percentage points during fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, total revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher software license update and product support revenues in all regions due to the high attachment rate of support contracts to our new software license sales and the renewal of substantially all of our eligible customer support contracts, incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions, primarily our acquisition of BEA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and increased demand for our On Demand service offerings. On a constant currency basis, new software license revenues contributed 5% to the growth in total revenues, software license updates and product support revenues contributed 92% and services revenues contributed 3%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 39% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 42% and Asia Pacific contributed 19%. Currency variances resulted in a reduction to our total operating expense growth of 5 percentage points during fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to higher salary expenses associated with increased headcount levels from acquisitions (primarily BEA) and higher amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions (primarily BEA) that we completed since the beginning of fiscal 2008. In addition, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2009 due to a $57 million gain on property sale recognized in fiscal 2008, which decreased operating expenses in that period. These increases were partially offset by constant currency decreases in our commissions and bonus expenses. Currency variances resulted in a reduction of 9 percentage points to our total operating margin growth during fiscal 2009. On a constant and reported currency basis, total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage 41 Table of Contents of total revenues increased during fiscal 2009 as the growth rate of our total revenues exceeded the growth rate of our total operating expenses. The growth rate in our total operating expenses was significantly impacted by the growth rate in our intangible asset amortization, which was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a part of the BEA transaction at the end of fiscal 2008, and to a lesser extent, our restructuring expenses growth. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Total revenues increased in fiscal 2008 due to increased demand for our products and services offerings and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. The growth in our total revenues was positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points in fiscal 2008 due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major international currencies. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues contributed 38% to the growth in total revenues, software license updates and product support revenues contributed 45% and services revenues contributed 17%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 50% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 37% and Asia Pacific contributed 13%. Total operating expenses were adversely affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels (primarily resulting from our fiscal 2007 acquisitions, our acquisition of Agile Software Corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and, to a lesser extent, our acquisition of BEA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008), as well as higher commissions and bonuses associated with increased revenues, earnings and headcount levels. In addition, operating expenses also increased in fiscal 2008 due to higher amortization of intangible assets and additional stock-based compensation resulting from a higher fair value of grants (caused primarily by our higher stock price) issued in fiscal 2008 and the acceleration of vesting of certain acquired stock awards upon employee terminations pursuant to the original terms of those awards. Total operating expenses in fiscal 2007 were also reduced by a $52 million benefit as a result of a settlement of an acquired legal contingency from PeopleSoft for less than the amount accrued as of the end of the purchase price allocation period. The increases in operating expenses during fiscal 2008 were partially offset by a $57 million gain on property sale and a $127 million reduction of in-process research and development. Total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal 2008. The growth in our operating margin in fiscal 2008 was the result of our revenue growth, both organic and from acquisitions, which generally exceeded the growth rate of the majority of our expenses. In addition, our reported operating margin growth was favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 9 percentage points. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges and Gains To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results include the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions as well as certain other significant expense and income items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Support deferred revenues(1) $ 243 $ 179 $ 212 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 1,713 1,212 878 Acquisition related and other(3)(5) 117 124 140 Restructuring(4) 117 41 19 Stock-based compensation(5) 340 257 198 Income tax effect(6) (730 ) (535 ) (414 ) $ 1,800 $ 1,278 $ 1,033 (1) In connection with purchase price allocations related to our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired 42 Table of Contents businesses as independent entities, in the amounts of $243 million, $179 million and $212 million in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Approximately $21 million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts assumed will not be recognized in fiscal 2010 that would otherwise be recognized by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of these business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these support contracts, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contract value over the support renewal period. (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions, primarily BEA, Hyperion, Siebel and PeopleSoft. As of May 31, 2009, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets, excluding the impact of additional intangible assets through any subsequent acquisitions, such as from our proposed acquisition of Sun, are as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2010 $ 1,669 Fiscal 2011 1,364 Fiscal 2012 1,217 Fiscal 2013 1,084 Fiscal 2014 881 Thereafter 1,054 Total $ 7,269 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of in-process research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, personnel related costs for transitional and other employees, certain business combination adjustments after the purchase price allocation period has ended, and certain other operating expenses (income), net. For fiscal 2008, acquisition related and other expenses include a gain on property sale of $57 million and, for fiscal 2007, acquisition related and other expenses include a benefit of $52 million related to the settlement of a pre-acquisition lawsuit against PeopleSoft (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). In fiscal 2010, certain of the items that we record to acquisition related and other expenses will change as a result of our adoption of Statement 141(R), which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements (see further discussion in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above). (4) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2009 and 2008 relate to Oracle employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan that was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and our Fiscal 2008 Oracle Restructuring Plan that was initiated in the second quarter, and amended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Restructuring costs during fiscal 2007 relate to an Oracle-based restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 for which additional expenses were recorded during fiscal 2007. In connection with any acquisition that we close in fiscal 2010, we will record involuntary termination and other exit costs associated with the acquisition to restructuring expenses as a result of our adoption of Statement 141(R), which is a change from current practice pursuant to existing accounting standards and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements (see further discussion in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above). (5) Stock-based compensation is included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Sales and marketing $ 67 $ 51 $ 38 Software license updates and product support 13 10 11 Cost of services 12 13 15 Research and development 155 114 85 General and administrative 93 69 49 Subtotal 340 257 198 Acquisition related and other 15 112 9 Total $ 355 $ 369 $ 207 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested options assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those options. (6) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 28.7% for fiscal 2009 instead of 28.6%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to the exclusion of the effect of an adjustment to our non-current deferred tax liability associated with acquired intangible assets. The income tax effects presented for fiscal 2008 and 2007 were calculated based on our effective tax rates of 29.5% and 28.6%, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Software Software includes new software licenses and software license updates and product support. New Software Licenses: New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware as well as our application software products. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Sales and marketing expenses are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software products, and also include marketing program costs and amortization of intangible assets.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total new software license revenues increased slightly in fiscal 2009 as a result of a 7% increase in database and middleware revenues, partially offset by a 10% decrease in applications revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions increased new software license revenues by 6% and 7%, respectively, and were partially offset by a decrease of 4% in the Americas region. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations of 7 percentage points, database and middleware revenues grew 7% in fiscal 2009 due primarily to BEA products and, to a lesser extent, other recently acquired products. In 44 Table of Contents reported currency, BEA products contributed $459 million, and other recently acquired products contributed $21 million to the total database and middleware revenues growth in fiscal 2009. The revenue contributions from BEA products, which already have been integrated with Oracle’s Fusion Middleware and are sold together, are based on our internal allocations consistent with previous periods. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points, application new software license revenues decreased in fiscal 2009 due to weaker global economic conditions and were partially offset by incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions. In reported currency, Primavera products contributed $33 million and our other recently acquired products contributed an incremental $27 million to our applications revenues in fiscal 2009. In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million declined by 7% in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unfavorable currency variations, and decreased to 50% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2009 from 51% in fiscal 2008. Total sales and marketing expenses were favorably impacted by 5 percentage points of currency variations during fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher salaries from increased headcount and higher amortization of intangible assets. These constant currency increases were partially offset by a reduction in our commissions and bonus expenses. In both reported and constant currency, total new software license margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased as our total new software license expenses growth, in particular higher amortization of intangible assets, exceeded our revenues growth. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: New software license revenues growth was positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 7 percentage points in fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues grew in all major product lines and across all geographies, with database and middleware revenues contributing 55% to the increase in new software license revenues and applications revenues contributing 45%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 52%, EMEA contributed 39% and Asia Pacific contributed 9% to the increase in new software license revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, database and middleware revenues grew 17% in fiscal 2008 as a result of increased demand for our database and middleware products as well as incremental revenues from acquired companies. Hyperion products contributed $103 million, BEA products contributed $93 million, Stellent products contributed $37 million, Tangosol products contributed $18 million and other recently acquired products contributed $2 million to the total database and middleware revenues growth in fiscal 2008. On a constant currency basis, applications revenues increased 33% in fiscal 2008. Hyperion products contributed $199 million, Agile products contributed $58 million, Metasolv products contributed $14 million, and other recently acquired products contributed $42 million to the total applications revenues growth in fiscal 2008. In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million grew by 42% in fiscal 2008 and increased from 46% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2007 to 51% in fiscal 2008. Sales and marketing expenses were adversely impacted by 5 percentage points of unfavorable currency variations during fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher salaries, benefits and travel expenses resulting from increased headcount, higher commissions expenses associated with both increased revenues and headcount levels, and an increase in planned marketing program expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $42 million reduction in litigation related expenses resulting primarily from the settlement of certain legal matters during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Total new software license margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased due to our new software licenses revenues growth rate and a favorable foreign currency impact, partially offset by higher growth rates in our amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses. Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include 45 Table of Contents the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2009 as a result of new software licenses sold with substantially all customers electing to purchase support contracts during fiscal 2009, the renewal of substantially all of the customer base eligible for renewal in the current fiscal year and incremental revenues from the expansion of our customer base from our acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 49%, EMEA contributed 38% and Asia Pacific contributed 13% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2009 include incremental revenues of $540 million from BEA, $20 million from Primavera and $49 million from other recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $243 million, $179 million and $212 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities, were not recognized in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year. Total software license updates and product support expenses were favorably impacted by 3 percentage points of currency variations during fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support expenses increased due to higher salary expenses associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer base and higher amortization expenses resulting from additional intangible assets acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2008, both of which were primarily attributable to our acquisition of BEA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. 46 Table of Contents Total software license updates and product support margin increased due to an increase in revenues, while margin as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly as the growth in our amortization of intangible assets exceeded our revenues growth. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: The growth in our software license updates and product support revenues was favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points in fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2008 in comparison to fiscal 2007 for similar reasons as those noted above. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 53%, EMEA contributed 36% and Asia Pacific contributed 11% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. Software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2008 included incremental revenues of $303 million from Hyperion, $38 million from BEA, $38 million from Agile, $30 million from Stellent, $25 million from Metasolv, and $46 million from other recently acquired companies. Software license updates and product support expenses were adversely impacted by 3 percentage points of unfavorable currency variations during fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support expenses increased due to higher salary and benefits associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer base, higher bonuses and commissions, and higher amortization expenses resulting from additional intangible assets acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2007. Total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased as our revenues grew faster than expenses, but was partially offset by a higher growth rate in our amortization of intangible assets.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, we believe the 47 Table of Contents decline in our consulting revenues was generally due to weaker demand resulting from a deterioration of global economic conditions in comparison to fiscal 2008. This decrease was partially offset by incremental contributions from our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, consulting expenses decreased during fiscal 2009 as a result of lower salary expenses due to a decrease in headcount and lower commissions and bonus expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher infrastructure and travel expenses (the majority of travel expenses are billable to customers). Consulting margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2009 as our expenses declined at a greater rate than our revenues. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Consulting revenues growth was positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points in fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting revenues increased during fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in application product implementations associated with the sales of our application software products and incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions, primarily Hyperion and BEA. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 36%, EMEA contributed 35% and Asia Pacific contributed 29% to the increase in consulting revenues. Consulting expenses were adversely impacted by 6 percentage points of unfavorable currency variations during fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting expenses increased during fiscal 2008 as a result of higher personnel related expenses attributable to higher headcount levels and third party contractor expenses that supported our increase in revenues. Total consulting margin as a percentage of revenues remained constant during fiscal 2008 as margin improvements in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were offset by expense growth in the Americas region and for our Oracle Financial Software Services Limited subsidiary (formerly, i-flex solutions limited) and an increase in our amortization of intangible asset expenses.

On Demand revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in each service category’s subscription base as a greater number of customers engaged us to provide IT services and outsourcing solutions. On a constant currency basis, Advanced Customer Services contributed the majority of our On Demand revenues growth. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 52%, EMEA contributed 23% and Asia Pacific contributed 25% to the increase in On Demand revenues. Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, On Demand expenses increased modestly in fiscal 2009 due to higher personnel related costs resulting from additional employees hired to support the increase in On Demand revenues. This expense increase was partially offset by a shift of certain U.S. based costs to global support centers in lower cost countries. Total On Demand margin and margin as a percentage of revenues improved primarily as a result of our Oracle On Demand business, which increased revenues while managing operating expenses to a modest level of growth in comparison to fiscal 2008.

On a constant currency basis, Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer Services contributed approximately equal amounts to the growth in On Demand revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 53%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 18% to the increase in On Demand revenues. Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, On Demand expenses increased in fiscal 2008 due to higher salaries and benefits expenses associated with increased headcount, and higher technology infrastructure related expenses to support the expansion of our customer base.

Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, education expenses declined in comparison to fiscal 2008, due to headcount reductions associated with restructuring actions taken and a reduction in other variable costs associated with the decline in business activity. Education margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2009 due to a reduction in our revenues, which declined at a higher rate than our expense reductions. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Education revenues growth was positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points in fiscal 2008.

These decreases were almost entirely offset by higher transitional and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from our acquisition of BEA, an increase in professional fees and an increase in certain acquisition related adjustments subsequent to the end of the purchase price allocation period. In addition, we also recognized a gain on property sale (described above) in fiscal 2008, which reduced expenses in that period. In fiscal 2010, the items that we record to acquisition related and other expenses will change as a result of our adoption of Statement 141(R), which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements (see further discussion in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above and in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 52 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Acquisition related and other expenses decreased during fiscal 2008 due to lower in-process research and development acquired as a part of our fiscal 2008 acquisitions in comparison to our fiscal 2007 acquisitions and a gain on a property sale. These decreases to acquisition related and other expenses were partially offset by higher transitional employee related expenses and increased stock-based compensation expenses due to the acceleration of certain acquired employee stock options, primarily Hyperion and BEA, pursuant to the terms of those options. Total operating expenses in fiscal 2007 were also reduced by a $52 million benefit as a result of a settlement of an acquired legal contingency from PeopleSoft for less than the amount accrued as of the end of the purchase price allocation period (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). Restructuring expenses: Restructuring expenses consist primarily of Oracle employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities in order to improve our Oracle-based cost structure prospectively.

The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2009 Plan are $241 million and will be recorded to restructuring expenses in our consolidated statements of operations as they are recognized. In fiscal 2009, we recorded $85 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2009 Plan. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining $156 million during fiscal 2010. Our estimated costs are preliminary and may be subject to change in future periods. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, our management approved, committed to and initiated a plan to restructure and improve efficiencies in our Oracle-based operations as a result of certain management and organizational changes and our recent acquisitions (the 2008 Plan). The 2008 Plan was amended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 to include the Oracle-based effects resulting from our acquisition of BEA. The total costs associated with the 2008 Plan were approximately $80 million, of which expenses of $39 million and $41 million were incurred during fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. In connection with any acquisition that we close in fiscal 2010 and prospective periods, we will record involuntary termination and other exit costs associated with such acquisition to restructuring expenses in our consolidated statement of operations as a result of our adoption of Statement 141(R), which is a change from current practice pursuant to existing accounting standards and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements (see further discussion in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above). Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: We incurred restructuring expenses of $41 million in fiscal 2008 pursuant to the 2008 Plan as described above.

The majority of these changes decreased “Other income, net” in the table above during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We account for our deferred compensation plan assets and obligations pursuant to EITF 97-14, Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested, which requires that the changes in obligations associated with our deferred compensation plan be recorded in our operating expenses while the corresponding change in the plan assets be recorded in non-operating income, net. The changes in obligations and asset values of the plan are equal and offsetting, such that there is no impact to our income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2009 or any other periods presented. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Non-operating income, net increased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher weighted average cash and marketable securities balances during fiscal 2008. Provision for Income Taxes: The effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2009 Actual Constant 2008 Actual Constant 2007 Provision for income taxes $ 2,241 -3% 6% $ 2,313 35% 32% $ 1,712 Effective tax rate 28.6% 29.5% 28.6% Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Provision for income taxes decreased during fiscal 2009 in comparison to fiscal 2008 due to a lower effective tax rate, which was primarily the result of a higher proportion of our worldwide taxable income being earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. In fiscal 2010, we will adopt Statement 141(R), which amends FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes and FIN 48. For fiscal 2009 and prior periods, we generally accounted for post-acquisition adjustments to business combination related deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax 54 Table of Contents positions as an increase or decrease to goodwill, regardless of the time that had elapsed since the acquisition date. Statement 141(R) will no longer permit this accounting and generally will require any such changes to be recorded in current period income tax expense, unless any such change is identified during the measurement period and it relates to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Such estimate revisions that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments will be recorded to our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations in the period the revision is made and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 due primarily to higher earnings before taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Working capital $ 9,432 17% $ 8,074 131% $ 3,496 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 12,624 14% $ 11,043 57% $ 7,020 Working Capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2009 in comparison to May 31, 2008 was due to the favorable impact to our net current assets, primarily our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, resulting from our net income generated during fiscal 2009. This increase in working capital was partially offset by an increase in our stock repurchases during fiscal 2009 in comparison to the prior year (we used $4.0 billion of cash for stock repurchases during fiscal 2009 in comparison to $2.0 billion used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2008), cash used for our acquisitions, cash used to repay $1.0 billion of our Senior Notes that matured in May 2009 and the reclassification of $1.0 billion of our Senior Notes due May 2010 as a current liability, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders for the first time in our history, and the decline in value of our net current assets held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar during fiscal 2009 (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet). Our working capital may be impacted by all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are variable. The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2008 in comparison to May 31, 2007 was primarily due to an increase in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting from the issuance of $5.0 billion of long-term senior notes in April 2008, additional cash and trade receivables generated from our operations and our adoption of FIN 48, which resulted in $1.3 billion of uncertain tax positions being prospectively reclassified from current income taxes payable to non-current taxes payable. These increases in working capital were partially offset by cash used in fiscal 2008 to pay for our acquisitions (primarily BEA) and to repurchase our common stock. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations and U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2009 in comparison to May 31, 2008 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities include $11.3 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2009. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet). As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against most major international currencies during fiscal 2009, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries declined relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2008. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were also partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions, the repayment of $1.0 billion of senior notes in May 2009, the repurchases of our common stock (see discussion above), and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. 55 Table of Contents The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2008 in comparison to May 31, 2007 is due to the issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in April 2008 and an increase in our operating cash flows resulting primarily from an increase in net income, partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions (primarily BEA), net repayments of our short-term commercial paper notes, and repurchases of our common stock. Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 58 days at May 31, 2009 compared with 63 days at May 31, 2008. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the adjustment that reduces our acquired software license updates and product support obligations to fair value. Our decline in days sales outstanding is primarily due to the improved timeliness of our collections efforts and the mix of our total revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, which weighted more heavily toward our license updates and product support revenues (such revenues generally have a lower DSO than our revenues from our other operating segments). Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Cash provided by operating activities $ 8,255 12% $ 7,402 34% $ 5,520 Cash used for investing activities $ (2,599 ) -71% $ (9,076 ) 83% $ (4,971 ) Cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (4,422 ) 235% $ 3,281 -388% $ (1,139 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for software license updates and product support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software license sales and, to a lesser extent, services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures as well as payments related to taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher net income adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and other net cash favorable balance sheet movements. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by increased accounts receivable primarily due to fourth quarter fiscal 2008 revenues growth (in particular, our new software license revenues growth). Cash Flows from Investing Activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2009 due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and a decrease in cash used to purchase marketable securities, net of proceeds received from sales and maturities. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions (primarily BEA), net of cash acquired, and an increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities, net of proceeds received from sales and maturities. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt facilities as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercise activity. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2009 increased in comparison to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2008 due to increased stock repurchases and dividend payments (see discussion in “Working Capital” above and in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and decreased proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during fiscal 2009. In addition, financing activities provided cash in fiscal 2008 as a result of our issuance of $5.0 billion of long-term senior notes in April 2008 and certain commercial paper issuances, net of commercial paper repayments. 56 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2008 increased in comparison to cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2007 due to the issuance of $5.0 billion of long-term senior notes, additional proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and decreased spending on stock repurchases, and were partially offset by $1.4 billion of net repayments of short-term commercial paper notes. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Cash provided by operating activities $ 8,255 12% $ 7,402 34% $ 5,520 Capital expenditures(1) (529 ) 118% (243 ) -24% (319 ) Free cash flow $ 7,726 8% $ 7,159 38% $ 5,201 Net income $ 5,593 1% $ 5,521 29% $ 4,274 Free cash flow as a percent of net income 138% 130% 122% (1) Represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and service offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell contracts that we have financed on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $891 million or approximately 19%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of our new software license revenues were financed through our financing division. Recent Financing Activities: In recent years, we have issued long-term senior notes to fund our acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. During fiscal 2009, we repaid $1.0 billion of senior notes that matured in May 2009. As of May 31, 2009, we have $10.2 billion of senior notes outstanding, including $1.0 billion that matures in May 2010. We have also, on occasion, issued short-term commercial paper notes in recent years pursuant to our commercial paper program to assist with the short-term financing for certain of our acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. Typically, we have repaid these liabilities within 12 months or less from their issuance date. We also have entered into certain revolving credit agreements to back-stop any commercial paper notes we may issue and for other general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2009, we have no commercial paper notes or amounts under our credit agreements outstanding. If we issue commercial paper notes in the future, we would most likely use our revolving credit agreements as a back-stop to these notes and we therefore consider that we have a total of $4.9 billion of capacity available to us pursuant to our credit agreements and commercial paper program as of May 31, 2009. Additional details of our various debt facilities and obligations are included in the “Contractual Obligations” section below and in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and risks associated with our debt obligations and any future debt issuances are included in Risk Factors (Item 1A). Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On October 20, 2008, our Board of Directors expanded our repurchase program by $8.0 billion and as of May 31, 2009, $6.3 billion was available for share repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 225.6 million shares for $4.0 billion, 97.3 million shares for $2.0 billion, and 233.5 million shares for $4.0 billion in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend repayments, our debt repayment obligations (as described below), our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. 57 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we declared and paid our first quarterly cash dividend in our history of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock. In June 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock payable on August 13, 2009 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2009. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2009: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 10,250 $ 1,000 $ 2,250 $ — $ 1,250 $ — $ 5,750 Capital leases(2) 1 1 — — — — — Interest payments on borrowings(1) 4,909 554 506 392 392 330 2,735 Operating leases(3) 1,334 388 287 206 137 116 200 Purchase obligations(4) 165 88 21 11 3 3 39 Funding commitments(5) 3 3 — — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 16,662 $ 2,034 $ 3,064 $ 609 $ 1,782 $ 449 $ 8,724 (1) Our borrowings (excluding capital leases) consist of the following as of May 31, 2009: Principal Balance Floating rate senior notes due May 2010 $ 1,000 5.00% senior notes due January 2011, net of discount of $3 2,247 4.95% senior notes due April 2013 1,250 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $7 1,993 5.75% senior notes due April 2018, net of discount of $1 2,499 6.50% senior notes due April 2038, net of discount of $2 1,248 Total borrowings $ 10,237 Our floating rate senior notes due May 2010 bore interest at a rate of 0.97% as of May 31, 2009. We have entered into an interest rate swap agreement that has the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floating rate senior notes due May 2010 so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.59%. Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreement and include estimates based on the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2009 for variable rate borrowings after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swap agreement. (2) Represents remaining payments under capital leases assumed from acquisitions. (3) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $259 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2009. (4) Represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. Amounts in this row do not include purchase orders for raw materials and other goods entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. (5) Represents the maximum additional capital we may need to contribute toward our venture fund investments, which are payable upon demand. On April 19, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Sun Microsystems, Inc., a provider of enterprise computing systems, software and services. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, our wholly owned subsidiary will merge with and into Sun and Sun will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle. Upon the consummation of the merger, each share of Sun common stock will be converted into the right to receive $9.50 in cash. In addition, options to acquire Sun common stock, Sun restricted stock unit awards and other equity- 58 Table of Contents based awards denominated in shares of Sun common stock outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger will generally be converted into options, restricted stock unit awards or other equity-based awards, as the case may be, denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. The estimated total purchase price of Sun is approximately $7.4 billion. This transaction is subject to Sun stockholder approval, regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions, and other customary closing conditions. We also have entered into certain other agreements to acquire other companies and expect these proposed acquisitions to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We intend to finance our proposed acquisitions through a combination of our internally available cash, our cash generated from operations, our existing available debt capacity, additional borrowings, or from the issuance of additional securities. As of May 31, 2009, we have $2.3 billion of unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant taxing authorities to pay approximately $79 million of these liabilities (these amounts have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of when they might be settled). Although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made, some or all may be made in fiscal 2010. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2010 (see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, including the proposed Sun acquisition, and dividend payments and repurchase common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, our existing available debt capacity, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the software industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software license business) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2010. 59 Table of Contents The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2009 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 5,331 $ 5,607 $ 5,453 $ 6,861 Gross profit $ 3,805 $ 4,185 $ 4,119 $ 5,441 Operating income $ 1,521 $ 1,975 $ 1,940 $ 2,884 Net income $ 1,077 $ 1,296 $ 1,329 $ 1,891 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.21 $ 0.25 $ 0.27 $ 0.38 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.21 $ 0.25 $ 0.26 $ 0.38 Fiscal 2008 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 29 May 31 Revenues $ 4,529 $ 5,313 $ 5,349 $ 7,239 Gross profit $ 3,193 $ 3,902 $ 3,931 $ 5,700 Operating income $ 1,217 $ 1,782 $ 1,875 $ 2,971 Net income $ 840 $ 1,303 $ 1,340 $ 2,037 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.16 $ 0.25 $ 0.26 $ 0.40 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.16 $ 0.25 $ 0.26 $ 0.39 Stock Options Our stock option program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2006 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.3% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options granted and assumed, net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised. Some of these options, which generally have 10 year exercise periods, have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price of our common stock. At May 31, 2009, 45% of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. Consistent with our historical practices, we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed 2.0% per year for our ongoing business. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2009, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised option awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 7.2%. 60 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option activity from June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2009 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Options outstanding at May 31, 2006 473 Options granted 191 Options assumed 62 Options exercised (317 ) Forfeitures and cancellations (50 ) Options outstanding at May 31, 2009 359 Average annualized options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures 68 Average annualized stock repurchases 185 Shares outstanding at May 31, 2009 5,005 Basic weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2009 5,124 Options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2009 7.2% In the money options outstanding (based on our May 31, 2009 stock price) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2009 3.9% Weighted average annualized options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2009 1.3% Weighted average annualized options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2009 -2.3% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to certain key employees. These annual option grants are made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large, diverse financial institutions worldwide that we believe mitigates some of the exposures associated with our holdings with these financial institutions. In addition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, substantially all with relatively short maturities (see a description of our debt securities held in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2009, total interest income was $279 million with our investments yielding an average 2.23% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was down by 121 basis points from 3.44% for fiscal 2008. If overall interest rates fell by 100 basis points from our average of 2.23% during fiscal 2009, our annual interest income would decline by approximately $121 million, assuming consistent investment levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and the related weighted average 61 Table of Contents interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2009. The cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are recorded at their fair values at May 31, 2009. May 31, 2009 Fair Value of Available-for-Sale Weighted Average (Dollars in millions) Securities Interest Rate Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,995 0.83% Marketable securities 3,629 1.14% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 12,624 0.92% Interest Expense Risk Our borrowings as of May 31, 2009 were $10.2 billion, consisting of $9.2 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes that are due in May 2010 and bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.06% per year (0.97% at May 31, 2009). We have entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations associated with our 2010 floating rate senior notes so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.59%, thereby reducing the impact of future interest rate changes on our future interest expense. We do not use interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreement and the 2010 senior notes match, including the notional amounts, interest rate reset dates, maturity dates and underlying market indices. Accordingly, we have designated the swap as a qualifying instrument and are accounting for the swap as a cash flow hedge pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The unrealized losses on the swap are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and the corresponding fair value payable is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The periodic interest settlements, which occur at the same interval as the interest payment and reset dates as the 2010 senior notes, are recorded as interest expense. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 90 days or less. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes included in non-operating income, net (the effective portion of our Yen net investment hedge described below is included in stockholders’ equity). Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. The notional amounts of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $860 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, and to purchase Euros in exchange for other major international currencies was €142 million ($198 million), as of May 31, 2009. The net unrealized gains of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $2 million at May 31, 2009. Net foreign exchange transaction (losses) gains included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $(65) million, $17 million and $17 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these 62 Table of Contents subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet). We hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure and provide a discussion in “Foreign Currency Net Investment Risk” below. As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against most major international currencies during fiscal 2009, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries as of May 31, 2009 declined relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2008. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was a (decrease) increase of $(501) million, $437 million, and $149 million, respectively. The following table includes the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies at May 31, 2009. U.S. Dollar Equivalent at (in millions) May 31, 2009 Euro $ 1,372 British Pound 655 Chinese Renminbi 635 Indian Rupee 333 Japanese Yen 196 Canadian Dollar 171 Other foreign currencies 1,617 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 4,979 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar weakened by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $498 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalent and marketable security balances. Foreign Currency Net Investment Risk We hedge the net assets of certain of our international subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders’ equity to offset the translation results on the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion, if any) is recognized in non-operating income, net. Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in stockholders’ equity, net of tax effects, were $(41) million, $(53) million and $28 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net gains on investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were $10 million, $23 million and $28 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At May 31, 2009, we had one net investment hedge in Japanese Yen. The Yen net investment hedge minimizes currency risk arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary offering of our majority owned subsidiary, Oracle Japan. The notional amount of our net investment hedge was $694 million and had a nominal fair value as of May 31, 2009.",2023-12-30 16:56:37.603180
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are the world’s largest enterprise software company. We are organized into two businesses, software and services, which are further divided into five operating segments. Each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in United States dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than United States dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our five operating segments follows. Software Business Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software license revenues and (2) software license updates and product support revenues. We expect that our software business revenues will continue to increase, which should allow us to improve margins and profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software Licenses: We license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. The growth in new software license revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software products and acquisitions. The new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period provides more visibility into the underlying fundamental performance of our software revenues than analysis of quarterly revenues. New software license revenues represented 33% of our total revenues in fiscal 2007. Our new software license margins have been affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies we have acquired. Competition in the software business is intense. Our goal is to maintain a first or second position in each of our software product categories and certain industry segments as well as to grow our software revenues faster than our competitors. We believe that the features and functionality of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. We have focused on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products by improving integration, decreasing installation times, lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use. Reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides our customers with a higher return on their investment, which we believe will create more demand for our products and services and provide us with a competitive advantage. We have also continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our software products and service levels. We believe this will lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve our goal of becoming our customers’ leading technology advisor. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period, as well as technical support assistance. In fiscal 2007, we also introduced Oracle Unbreakable Linux Support, which provides enterprise level support for the Linux operating system. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is influenced by three factors: (1) the support contract base of companies acquired, (2) the renewal rate of the support contract base and (3) the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represent approximately 46% of our total revenues in fiscal 2007, are our highest margin business unit. Support margins during fiscal 2007 were 90%, and accounted for 76% of our total margins over the same respective period. We believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will continue to grow for the following reasons: • Acquisitions over the past three years have significantly increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed. 25 Table of Contents • Substantially all customers purchase license updates and product support when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our support contract base. Even if new license revenue growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow assuming renewal and cancellation rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions add to the support contract base. • Substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal. We record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business acquisitions to their estimated fair value at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of $212 million, $391 million and $320 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. To the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, On Demand and education revenues. Our services business, which represents 21% of our total revenues in fiscal 2007, has significantly lower margins than our software business. Consulting: Consulting revenues have increased primarily due to consulting services provided by i-flex as well as an increase in application implementations created by higher sales of new software applications over the past year. We expect consulting revenues to continue to grow as consulting revenues tend to lag software revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses and our new license growth rates have generally increased over the corresponding period in the prior year over the past several quarters. On Demand: On Demand includes Oracle On Demand, CRM on Demand and Advanced Customer Services. We believe that our On Demand offerings provide an additional opportunity for customers to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive advantage. We have made and plan to continue to make investments in Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand to support current and future revenue growth, which has negatively impacted On Demand margins and we expect may continue to do so in the future. Education: The purpose of our education services is to further enhance the usability of our software products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our software revenues. Education revenues have been impacted by personnel reductions in our customers’ information technology departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions. Despite these trends, we expect education revenues to increase in fiscal year 2008, primarily due to an increase in customer training on the use of our acquired application products and increases in license revenues from our database and middleware products. Acquisitions An active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy. In the last three fiscal years, we have invested over $25 billion, in the aggregate, to acquire companies, products, services and technologies, including the acquisitions of PeopleSoft, Inc., a provider of enterprise applications software products; Siebel Systems, Inc., a provider of customer relationship management software; Hyperion Solutions Corporation, a provider of enterprise performance management and business intelligence software; and others. Typically, the significant majority of our integration activities related to an acquisition are substantially complete in the United States within three to six months after the closing of the acquisition. We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position, particularly in the applications marketplace, expands our customer base and provides greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and increase stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. See Note 2 of 26 Table of Contents our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our recent and pending acquisitions. We believe we can fund additional acquisitions with our internally available cash and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our commercial paper program, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations • Goodwill • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation • Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition We derive revenues from the following sources: (1) software, which includes new software license and software license updates and product support revenues, and (2) services, which include consulting, On Demand and education revenues. New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software, and exclude revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support. While the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of Statement of Position No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenue when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or 27 Table of Contents determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support, which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers. Software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers purchase both software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in SOP 97-2. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. We recognize no more than 90% of the milestone or total contract amount until project acceptance is obtained. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions, then new software license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees; (2) where services include significant modification or customization of the software; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. On Demand is comprised of Oracle On Demand, CRM On Demand and Advanced Customer Services. Oracle On Demand provides multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database, middleware and applications software at Oracle’s data center facilities or at a site of our customer’s choosing. CRM On Demand is a service offering that provides our customers with our Siebel CRM software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage. Advanced Customer Services are earned by providing customers configuration and performance analysis, personalized support and annual on-site technical services. Revenue from On Demand services is recognized over the term of the service period, which is generally one year. Education revenues include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by “vendor specific objective evidence.” Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all 28 Table of Contents elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and for software license updates and product support services, is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer. We may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results. We defer revenue for any undelivered elements, and recognize revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed, in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements, we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we provide for a sales return allowance in accordance with FASB Statement No. 48, Revenue Recognition when Right of Return Exists. If acceptance provisions are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement or if we cannot reasonably estimate the incidence of returns, revenue is recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software licenses and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenue is recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30; however, terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to credit worthy customers through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. We account for the sale of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have licensed our software to these same companies (a “Concurrent Transaction”). Software license agreements that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any software license transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length, and settle the purchase in cash. We 29 Table of Contents recognize new software license revenue from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based on their estimated fair values. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from license sales, maintenance agreements, consulting contracts, customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the acquired company’s brand and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In connection with purchase price allocations, we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with acquisitions. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation. As a result, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amount of $212 million, $391 million and $320 million that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their contracts when the contract is eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Had we included our estimated selling and research and development activities, and the associated margin for unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided under our assumed support arrangements, the fair value of the support obligations would have been significantly higher than what we have recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount of software license updates and product support revenue historically and in future periods related to these assumed contracts. Other significant estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs are primarily comprised of severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management but which are subject to refinement. To estimate restructuring expenses, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan. Decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with pre-merger activities of the companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period (generally within one year of the acquisition date) and as operating expenses thereafter. 30 Table of Contents For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies. If, during the purchase price allocation period, we are able to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation. If, as of the end of the purchase price allocation period, we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated. With the exception of unresolved tax matters, after the end of the purchase price allocation period, any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre-acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined. Goodwill We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The provisions of Statement 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, did not result in an impairment charge. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the U.S. are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the U.S. and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax 31 Table of Contents assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. As part of our accounting for business combinations, some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the quarter the impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expense as part of the purchase price allocation. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. In fiscal 2008, we will adopt FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Please refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. As a result of our acquisition of PeopleSoft in fiscal 2005, we inherited contingent liabilities resulting from a program PeopleSoft had implemented prior to the consummation of our acquisition of PeopleSoft (referred to as the “customer assurance program” or “CAP”). See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Stock-Based Compensation On June 1, 2006, we adopted Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, under the modified prospective method. Statement 123R generally requires share-based payments to employees to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. Prior to June 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and applied the disclosure provisions of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended. Under Opinion 25, we generally did not recognize any compensation expense for stock options as the exercise price of our options was equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of our stock-based compensation expense 32 Table of Contents recognized under Opinion 25 related to options assumed from acquisitions. For pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair values for options granted and options assumed were amortized using the accelerated expense attribution method. In addition, we reduced pro forma stock compensation expense for actual forfeitures in the periods they occurred. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for Statement 123R. We have applied the provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of Statement 123R. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the impact of our adoption of Statement 123R and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based employee compensation. Upon our adoption of Statement 123R, we were required to estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimated forfeitures based on historical experience, forfeitures in the future may differ. Under Statement 123R, the forfeiture rate must be revised if actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates. Also in connection with our adoption of Statement 123R, we elected to recognize awards granted after our adoption date under the straight-line amortization method. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of our publicly traded stock options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by job classification. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. Our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method as prescribed under FASB Staff Position FAS 123R-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. The accounting guidance under Statement 123R is relatively new and several interpretations have been released since the pronouncement has been issued. Additional interpretations may be released and the application of these principles may be subject to further refinement over time. In addition, to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates and implement the change in our expense attribution method from accelerated to straight-line, which we elected when adopting Statement 123R, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded during our fiscal 2007 reporting periods. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends. If the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. 33 Table of Contents We also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales. These estimates are based on historical sales returns, the volume and size of our larger transactions and other known factors. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Results of Operations The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 is impacted by our acquisition of Siebel in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the consolidation of i-flex beginning June 1, 2006 (beginning of fiscal 2007) and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Hyperion in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is also impacted by acquisitions, principally our acquisition of PeopleSoft in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, and, to a lesser extent, the acquisitions of Siebel in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and Retek, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to growth in new software license revenues, the amount of revenues associated with software license updates and product support as well as On Demand services, and present supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting and stock-based compensation where applicable. Although certain revenue contributions from our acquisitions are quantifiable, we are unable to identify the following: • The contribution of consulting and education services revenues from acquired companies in fiscal 2007 and 2006 (with the exception of i-flex and Hyperion consulting revenues and Hyperion education revenues for which we disclose the impact in fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal 2006) as the significant majority of these services have been fully integrated into our existing operations. • The contribution of expenses associated with acquired products and services in fiscal 2007 and 2006 (with the exception of certain i-flex and Hyperion operating expenses for which we disclose the impact in fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal 2006) as the significant majority of these services have been fully integrated into our existing operations. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends, the information has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • The quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to our sales force integration efforts, in particular the effect of having a single sales force offer similar products. The commissions earned by our integrated sales force generally do not vary based on the application product sold. We believe that if our sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different. • The significant majority of our acquisitions in the periods presented did not result in our entry into a new line of business or product category. Therefore, we provided multiple products with substantially similar features and functionality. • Although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, amounts shown as support deferred revenue in our supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting and stock-based compensation are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect on May 31, 2006, which was the 34 Table of Contents last day of our prior fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, our financial statements would reflect revenues of $1.35 million in fiscal 2007 (using 1.35 as the exchange rate) and $1.27 million in fiscal 2006 (using 1.27 as the exchange rate). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2007 results using the fiscal 2006 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the periods. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual results as reported and based on constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 Actual Constant 2006 Actual Constant 2005 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 9,460 24% 23% $ 7,652 32% 31% $ 5,798 EMEA(1) 6,037 28% 20% 4,708 10% 15% 4,288 Asia Pacific 2,499 24% 21% 2,020 18% 21% 1,713 Total revenues 17,996 25% 22% 14,380 22% 23% 11,799 Total Operating Expenses 12,022 25% 22% 9,644 24% 25% 7,777 Total Operating Margin $ 5,974 26% 21% $ 4,736 18% 20% $ 4,022 Total Operating Margin% 33% 33% 34% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 53% 53% 49% EMEA 34% 33% 36% Asia Pacific 13% 14% 15% Total Revenues by Business: Software $ 14,211 23% 20% $ 11,541 23% 24% $ 9,421 Services 3,785 33% 29% 2,839 19% 21% 2,378 Total revenues $ 17,996 25% 22% $ 14,380 22% 23% $ 11,799 % Revenues by Business: Software 79% 80% 80% Services 21% 20% 20% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Total revenues increased in fiscal 2007 due to increased demand for our products and services offerings, strong sales execution, and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. Total revenues were positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 3 percentage points in fiscal 2007 due to the weakening of the United States dollar relative to other major international currencies. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues contributed 27% to the growth in total revenues, software license updates and product support revenues contributed 47% and services contributed 26%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 56% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 14%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels (primarily resulting from our acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006), as well as higher commissions and travel and entertainment expenses associated with both increased revenues and headcount levels. In addition, operating expenses also increased in fiscal 2007 due to higher amortization costs of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses related to our adoption of Statement 123R. Operating expenses were negatively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 3 percentage 35 Table of Contents points. The aforementioned increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring expenses and the settlement of a pre-acquisition PeopleSoft related contingency that benefited our operating expenses (see Acquisition Related Charges discussion below). Operating margins as a percentage of total revenues were flat in fiscal 2007 and were favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points. Our revenues grew at a faster rate than our operating expenses, excluding amortization costs of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses. The increases in those cost categories offset the slower growth in other operating expenses. International operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. As a result, total revenues and expenses will be affected by changes in the relative strength of the United States dollar against certain major international currencies. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Total revenues increased in fiscal 2006 due to strong sales execution, incremental revenues from acquisitions and a strengthening in our competitive position. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues contributed 50% to the growth in total revenues, new software licenses contributed 32% and services revenues contributed 18%. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 22% and Asia Pacific contributed 13%. Total revenues in the Americas, specifically in the United States, increased at a faster rate than in other regions primarily due to the relative geographical mix of revenues from our acquired companies. Operating expenses were favorably affected by 1 percentage point as a result of the strengthening of the United States dollar relative to other major international currencies. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher headcount levels and associated personnel related costs in sales and marketing, consulting and research and development, higher commissions due to the increase in revenues and greater amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by lower restructuring and acquisition related expenses. Operating margins as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly in fiscal 2006 due to higher costs associated with acquisitions, principally amortization of intangible assets. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Acquisition Accounting and Stock-Based Compensation To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Results of Operations” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. 36 Table of Contents Our results of operations include the following business combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions as well as other expenses including stock-based compensation: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Support deferred revenue(1) $ 212 $ 391 $ 320 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 878 583 219 Acquisition related charges(3)(5) 140 137 208 Restructuring(4) 19 85 147 Stock-based compensation(5) 198 31 25 Income tax effect(6) (414 ) (362 ) (264 ) $ 1,033 $ 865 $ 655 (1) In connection with purchase price allocations related to our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amounts of $212 million, $391 million and $320 million in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Approximately $120 million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts assumed will not be recognized in fiscal 2008 that would have otherwise been recognized by the acquired businesses as independent entitles, due to the application of business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these support contracts, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contract value over the support renewal period. (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions, primarily PeopleSoft, Siebel, Hyperion and i-flex. Estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is as follows (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2008 $ 1,114 2009 1,101 2010 976 2011 756 2012 620 Thereafter 1,397 Total $ 5,964 (3) Acquisition related charges primarily consist of in-process research and development expenses, integration-related professional services, stock-based compensation expenses and personnel related costs for transitional employees. For fiscal 2007, acquisition related charges also included a $52 million benefit related to the settlement of a pre-acquisition lawsuit filed against PeopleSoft on behalf of the U.S. government. (4) Restructuring expenses relate to Oracle employee severance and facility closures in connection with restructuring plans initiated in the third quarters of fiscal 2006 and 2005. In fiscal 2007, our restructuring expenses relate to notifications made pursuant to the Fiscal 2006 Oracle Restructuring Plan. 37 Table of Contents (5) Stock-based compensation is included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2007 2006 2005 Sales and marketing $ 38 $ 8 $ 6 Software license updates and product support 11 3 2 Cost of services 15 7 7 Research and development 85 13 10 General and administrative 49 — — Subtotal 198 31 25 Acquisition related charges 9 18 47 Total $ 207 $ 49 $ 72 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related charges resulted from unvested options assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was fully accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of these options. We adopted Statement 123R on June 1, 2006 under the modified prospective method. Statement 123R requires us to record non-cash operating expenses associated with stock option awards at their estimated fair values. Prior to our Statement 123R adoption, we were required to record stock-based compensation expenses at intrinsic values. Accordingly, prior to our adoption of Statement 123R, substantially all of our stock-based compensation expense related to options assumed from acquisitions. In accordance with the modified prospective method, our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the changes in methodology to expense options at fair values in accordance with Statement 123R. As of May 31, 2007, the unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options expected to vest was approximately $356 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. See Note 7 of Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our adoption of Statement 123R. (6) The income tax effects on purchase accounting adjustments and other significant expenses including stock-based compensation were calculated based on our effective tax rates of 28.6%, 29.7% and 28.8% in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively 38 Table of Contents Software Software includes new software licenses and software license updates and product support. New Software Licenses: New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware as well as our application software products. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels.

Database and middleware revenues contributed 57% to the increase in new software license revenues, while applications revenues contributed 43%. The Americas contributed 50%, EMEA contributed 33% and Asia Pacific contributed 17% to the increase in new software license revenues. 39 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, database and middleware revenues grew 12% as a result of a gain in market share, increased demand for our database and middleware products as well as incremental revenues from acquired companies. Siebel products contributed incremental revenues of $48 million, Stellent products $26 million, Hyperion products $16 million and other recently acquired products $19 million to the total database and middleware revenue growth in fiscal 2007. On a constant currency basis, applications revenues increased 29% as a result of a gain in market share resulting from a strengthening of our competitive position in the applications market due to improved product features and functionality and incremental revenues from acquired companies. Siebel products contributed incremental revenues of $130 million, i-flex products $50 million, Hyperion products $27 million, Portal products $22 million, Demantra products $21 million and other recently acquired products $22 million to total applications revenue growth. New software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million grew by 24% in fiscal 2007 and increased from 45% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2006 to 46% in fiscal 2007. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher personnel related expenses associated with increased headcount, as well as higher commissions expenses associated with both increased revenues and headcount levels. Total new software license margin as a percentage of revenues declined as expenses, including amortization costs of intangible assets, grew at a faster rate than revenues. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues increased due to strong sales execution in all product lines. Applications revenues contributed 60% to the increase in new software license revenues, while database and middleware revenues contributed 40%. Additionally, new software license revenues increased in all geographic regions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 57%, EMEA contributed 23% and Asia Pacific contributed 20% to the increase in new software license revenues. New software license revenues in the Americas, specifically in the United States, increased at a faster rate than in other regions primarily due to the relative geographical mix of revenues and location of sales personnel from our acquired companies. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, database and middleware revenues grew 11% driven by increased demand for database option products, and gain in market share in the application server market as a result of better sales execution and more competitive features and functionality. Siebel products contributed $34 million to the growth in database and middleware revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, applications revenues increased 67% as a result of increased demand for our applications products, including products from acquired companies, better sales execution as a result of segmenting our sales force by product and a strengthening of our competitive position in the applications market, particularly in the United States and EMEA. PeopleSoft products contributed $220 million to the growth in applications revenue in fiscal 2006, Siebel products contributed $103 million and Retek products contributed $41 million. New software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million increased from 40% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2005 to 45% in fiscal 2006. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and marketing expenses increased due to higher commission expenses resulting from the growth in new software license revenues, higher personnel related expenditures primarily associated with our expanded sales force from acquired companies and higher advertising expenses. The total new software license margin as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to incremental amortization of intangible assets and higher compensation expenses. Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business 40 Table of Contents include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 59%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. Software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2007 include incremental revenues of $310 million from Siebel, $37 million from i-flex, $19 million from Hyperion, and $55 million from other recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed to their estimated fair value at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $212 million, $391 million and $320 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities, were not recognized in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support expenses increased due to higher salary and benefits associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer base, higher amortization expenses resulting from additional intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and higher stock-based compensation expenses. Software license updates and product support expenses 41 Table of Contents include $16 million in incremental expenses from i-flex and Hyperion. Total software license updates and product support margin as a percentage of revenues was flat as intangible asset amortization expense and stock-based compensation grew much faster than revenues and offset the lower growth in other operating expenses. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased for similar reasons as noted above. Software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2006 include incremental revenues of $797 million from PeopleSoft contracts and $90 million from Siebel contracts. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 72% to the growth in software license updates and product support revenues, EMEA contributed 20% and Asia Pacific contributed 8%. Software license updates and product support revenues in the Americas, specifically in the United States, increased at a faster rate than in other regions primarily due to the relative geographical mix of revenues and existing support contract bases of our acquired companies. Software license updates and product support expenses increased primarily due to higher salary and benefits associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer base and higher bonuses as a result of increased revenue levels. The software license updates and product support margin as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to incremental amortization of intangible assets. Services Services consist of consulting, On Demand and education. Consulting: Consulting revenues are earned by providing services to customers in the design, implementation, deployment and upgrade of our database and middleware as well as applications software products. The cost of providing consulting services consists primarily of personnel related expenditures.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to the increase in consulting revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting expenses increased as a result of higher personnel related expenses attributed to higher headcount levels and third-party contractor expenses. Consulting expenses include $281 million of incremental expenses from i-flex and $17 million from Hyperion. Total consulting margin as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to higher margins contributed by i-flex. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: The increase in consulting revenues is primarily due to an increase in application product implementations and billable hours primarily provided by consultants who were formerly employed by our acquired companies. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 56% to the growth in consulting revenues, EMEA contributed 26% and Asia Pacific contributed 18%. Consulting expenses increased as a result of higher salary and benefit expenses due to additional resources we acquired as part of our acquisitions and increased external contractor costs due to employee attrition. The total consulting margin as a percentage of revenues declined in fiscal 2006 in comparison to fiscal 2005 as a result of additional consulting expenses attributed to headcount levels and external contractor related expenditures.

Advanced Customer Services revenues contributed 46% of the growth, while Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand contributed 33% and 21%, respectively. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 32% and Asia Pacific contributed 13% to the increase in On Demand revenues. Advanced Customer Services revenues included $50 million of incremental revenues from Siebel in fiscal 2007 while CRM On Demand revenues included $31 million. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, On Demand expenses increased due to higher personnel related expenditures, higher amortization expenses resulting from intangible assets, as well as higher technology infrastructure related costs to support the expansion of our customer base. CRM On Demand expense growth reflects a full year of expenses related to our Siebel CRM On Demand employees (in comparison to only four months in fiscal 2006). Total On Demand margin as a percentage of revenues decreased, primarily driven by more rapid growth in personnel related expenses in comparison to revenues, and to a lesser extent, growth in technology infrastructure related expenditures in Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand as well as amortization of intangible assets. Advanced Customer Services operating margins remained flat compared with the prior year while operating losses in both Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand increased. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: On Demand revenues increased in fiscal 2006 due to the expansion of our subscription base in Oracle On Demand services, including incremental revenues from Siebel of $9 million, as well as higher revenues from Advanced Customer Services, including incremental revenues from Siebel of $17 million and PeopleSoft of $9 million. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65% to the increase in On Demand revenues, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 5%. On Demand expenses increased due to higher personnel related expenditures in both our Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer Services businesses as a result of additional resources acquired from Siebel as well as higher computer and technology related charges and external contractor costs in our Oracle On Demand business. The total On Demand margin as a percentage of revenues declined due to lower margins associated with the CRM On Demand offering as well as additional expenditures incurred to support planned future growth. 44 Table of Contents Education: Education revenues are earned by providing instructor led, media based and internet based training in the use of our database and middleware as well as applications software.

The Americas contributed 46%, EMEA contributed 26% and Asia Pacific contributed 28% to the increase in education revenues. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, education expenses increased due to incremental headcount and associated personnel related expenditures, as well as higher third party contractor and royalty fees associated with increased revenues. Education expenses also include $3 million of incremental expenses from Hyperion. Total education margin as a percentage of revenues decreased as expenses grew at a higher rate than revenues. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Education revenues increased due to an increase in customer training on the use of our acquired applications products. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 64%, EMEA contributed 24% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the overall increase in education revenues. Education expenses increased due to incremental headcount and associated personnel related expenditures related to Siebel education employees and higher external contractor costs. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position. 45 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 Actual Constant 2006 Actual Constant 2005 Research and development(1) $ 2,110 14% 11% $ 1,859 25% 24% $ 1,481 Stock-based compensation 85 541% 541% 13 31% 31% 10 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 10 -47% -47% 17 -49% -38% 32 Total expenses $ 2,205 17% 16% $ 1,889 24% 24% $ 1,523 % of Total Revenues 12% 13% 13% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation (2) Included as a component of ‘Amortization of Intangible Assets’ in our consolidated statements of operations Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, research and development expenses increased due to higher salary and benefits expenses associated with higher headcount levels, increased stock-based compensation expenses due to the adoption of Statement 123R and increased external contractor expenses. Research and development expenses include incremental expenses of $25 million from i-flex and $19 million from Hyperion. Research and development headcount increased by approximately 3,600 employees, consisting of a 33% increase in personnel in our applications products divisions and a 14% increase in personnel in our database and middleware products division. The increase in applications headcount includes approximately 1,200 employees acquired from i-flex and 200 from Hyperion, while the increase in database and middleware headcount includes approximately 400 employees acquired from Hyperion. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Research and development headcount increased by approximately 1,300, which represented a 13% increase in personnel in our database and middleware products division and a 5% increase in personnel in our applications products division. The increase in database and middleware headcount was primarily due to hiring of resources outside the United States, while the increase in applications headcount was primarily due to Siebel resources acquired. Research and development expenses increased due to incremental salary and benefits for the additional headcount, higher discretionary bonus expenditures and higher facility and technology costs, partially offset by lower external contractor costs.

See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our intangible assets (including weighted average useful lives) and related amortization expenses. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Amortization of intangible assets increased due to amortization of purchased intangibles from Siebel and other acquisitions in fiscal 2006 as well as a full year of amortization in fiscal 2006 related to PeopleSoft intangibles acquired compared with only five months of amortization in fiscal 2005. Acquisition Related Charges: Acquisition related charges primarily consist of in-process research and development expenses, integration-related professional services, stock-compensation expenses and personnel related expenses for transitional employees. Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related charges relates to unvested options assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was fully accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of these options.

This increase was offset by a $52 million benefit related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed in October 2003 against PeopleSoft on behalf of the U.S. government, prior to our acquisition of PeopleSoft. The lawsuit alleged PeopleSoft made defective pricing disclosures to the General Services Administration. This lawsuit represented a pre-acquisition contingency that we identified and assumed in connection with our acquisition of PeopleSoft. On October 10, 2006, we agreed to pay the U.S. government approximately $98 million to settle this lawsuit. Business combination accounting standards require that after the end of the purchase price allocation period, any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre-acquisition contingency is to be included as an element of net income in the period of settlement, versus an adjustment to the original purchase price allocation. Since the purchase price allocation period for PeopleSoft ended in our third quarter of fiscal 2006, the favorable difference of $52 million between the estimated 47 Table of Contents exposure recorded for this lawsuit during the purchase price allocation period and the actual settlement amount has been included in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Acquisition related charges decreased due to lower professional fees, stock-based compensation charges and lower transitional employee costs, partially offset by higher in-process research and development charges primarily related to the Siebel acquisition. Restructuring: Restructuring expenses consist of Oracle employee severance costs and Oracle duplicate facilities closures which were initiated to improve our cost structure as a result of acquisitions.

Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2007 relate to notifications made pursuant to the Fiscal 2006 Oracle Restructuring Plan. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Restructuring expenses decreased in fiscal 2006 due to lower headcount terminations and related severance costs.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher average borrowings related to the $5.75 billion senior notes issued in January 2006 as well as outstanding balances under our commercial paper program and unsecured loan facility, both of which were repaid in fiscal 2006. Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net investment gains related to marketable securities and other investments as well as the minority interests’ share in the net profits of i-flex and Oracle Japan. 48 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2007 Actual Constant 2006 Actual Constant 2005 Interest income $ 295 74% 72% $ 170 -8% -8% $ 185 Foreign currency gains (losses) 45 15% 19% 39 -368% -374% (14 ) Net investment gains related to equity securities 22 -11% -10% 25 1301% 1292% 2 Minority interest (71 ) 72% 70% (41 ) -2% -2% (42 ) Other 64 28% 22% 50 52% 52% 33 Total non-operating income, net $ 355 46% 45% $ 243 49% 50% $ 164 Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Non-operating income, net increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher interest income attributable to an increase in average interest rates (the weighted average interest rate earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased from 3.04% in fiscal 2006 to 3.97% in fiscal 2007), partially offset by higher minority interests’ share in the net profits of i-flex and Oracle Japan. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Non-operating income, net increased in fiscal 2006 as a result of higher foreign currency gains on our Japanese net investment hedge and the Chinese currency revaluation, $14 million of equity in earnings associated with our interest in i-flex and higher gains on sales of equity securities. Interest income decreased slightly due to lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased from 1.93% in fiscal 2005 to 3.04% in fiscal 2006. Provision for Income Taxes: The effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Provision for income taxes $ 1,712 20% $ 1,429 23% $ 1,165 Effective tax rate 28.6% 29.7% 28.8% Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher earnings before tax, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was slightly lower than in fiscal 2006 primarily due to additional research and development tax credits as well as agreements reached with foreign tax authorities on certain tax positions. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2006 due to higher earnings before tax and a higher effective tax rate. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 is primarily attributable to a higher percentage of earnings in high tax jurisdictions as compared with other lower tax rate jurisdictions. In addition, we did not benefit from certain non-recurring tax events in fiscal 2006 that occurred in fiscal 2005, including the settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations on certain tax assessments and the true-up of estimated tax accruals upon the filing of our prior year tax returns. We also incurred higher non-deductible in-process research and development charges in fiscal 2006.

The increase in working capital in fiscal 2006 is primarily due to our issuance of $5.75 billion long-term senior notes in January 2006 as well as greater cash flows from operations from higher sales volumes, partially offset by cash used to pay for acquisitions, stock repurchases, and the reduction of our other debt obligations. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments in time deposits held at major banks, commercial paper, United States government agency discount notes, money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, corporate notes and United States government agency notes. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities include $5.0 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2007. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is a result of cash used to pay for acquisitions and stock repurchases, partially offset by an increase in our operating cash flows from higher sales volumes, increases in our short-term and long-term borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises. Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 62 days at May 31, 2007 compared with 55 days at May 31, 2006. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the adjustment to reduce software license updates and product support revenues related to adjusting the carrying value for deferred support revenues acquired to fair value. Our increase in days sales outstanding is primarily due to higher days sales outstanding from acquired companies, as well as differences in the timing of completion of certain sales transactions between years.

Payments from customers for software license updates and product support agreements are generally received by the beginning of the contract term, which is generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software license sales and, to a lesser extent, services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures as well as payments related to taxes and facilities. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by increased accounts receivables due to fourth quarter fiscal 2007 revenue growth, cash payments to terminate leases associated with excess facilities assumed in the Siebel acquisition, an increase in cash interest payments resulting from higher average borrowings and the settlement of a pre-acquisition lawsuit filed against PeopleSoft. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher net income, excluding non-cash charges, partially offset by increased accounts receivables due to fourth quarter fiscal 2006 revenue growth. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of marketable securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2007 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. We paid cash to purchase a number of companies in fiscal 2007 including Hyperion, Stellent, MetaSolv, and Portal Software, and to purchase additional equity securities in i-flex. Cash outflows in fiscal 2006 primarily relate to our acquisition of Siebel and our equity investment purchases in i-flex. 50 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, as well as proceeds from property sales. Investing cash outflows in fiscal 2005 include cash paid for our acquisition of PeopleSoft, whereas investing cash outflows in fiscal 2006 primarily relate to our acquisition of Siebel and our equity investment purchases in i-flex. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt obligations as well as stock repurchase and stock option exercise activity. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2007 primarily relates to an increase in stock repurchases and lower borrowings net of repayments when compared with the prior year. At May 31, 2007 we had approximately $4.2 billion available for share repurchases pursuant to a program authorized by our Board of Directors and we intend to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to this program. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher stock repurchases, partially offset by higher net borrowings. We increased our share repurchases in fiscal 2006 due to the issuance of approximately 141 million shares of common stock in connection with our Siebel acquisition. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flow generated from operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Cash provided by operating activities $ 5,520 22% $ 4,541 28% $ 3,552 Capital expenditures(1) $ (319 ) 35% $ (236 ) 26% $ (188 ) Free cash flow $ 5,201 21% $ 4,305 28% $ 3,364 Net income $ 4,274 26% $ 3,381 17% $ 2,886 Free cash flow as a percent of net income 122% 127% 117% (1) Represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Long-Term Customer Financing In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, $891 million, $618 million and $456 million or approximately 15%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our new software license revenues were financed through our financing division. We generally sell contracts that we have financed on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. Contractual Obligations The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most 51 Table of Contents significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2007: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Principal payments on short-term borrowings and long-term debt(1) $ 7,611 $ 1,361 $ 1,000 $ 1,000 $ 2,250 $ — $ 2,000 Capital leases(2) 3 3 — — — — — Interest payments on short-term borrowings and long-term debt(1) 1,658 325 321 269 218 105 420 Operating leases(3) 1,448 339 301 242 162 124 280 Purchase obligations(4) 292 73 196 3 3 3 14 Funding commitments(5) 3 3 — — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 11,015 $ 2,104 $ 1,818 $ 1,514 $ 2,633 $ 232 $ 2,714 (1) Short-term borrowings and long-term debt consists of the following as of May 31, 2007: Principal Balance Commercial paper notes (effective interest rate of 5.33)% $ 1,355 Floating rate senior notes due May 2009 (effective interest rate of 5.38)% 1,000 Floating rate senior notes due May 2010 (effective interest rate of 5.42)% 1,000 5.00% senior notes due January 2011, net of discount of $6 2,244 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $9 1,991 Other 3 Total borrowings $ 7,593 (1) Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreements and include estimates based on the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2007 for variable rate borrowings. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our borrowings. (2) Represents remaining payments under capital leases of computer equipment assumed from acquisitions. (3) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $364 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2007. (4) Represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. (5) Represents the maximum additional capital we may need to contribute toward our venture fund investments which are payable upon demand. In May 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire Agile Software Corporation, a leading provider of product lifecycle management software, for $8.10 per share in cash, or approximately $495 million. The merger is subject to stockholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in mid to late July 2007. This commitment is not reflected in the above table. 52 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Recent Financing Activities Commercial Paper Program In February 2006, we entered into dealer agreements with various financial institutions and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, relating to a $3.0 billion commercial paper program (CP Program). Under the CP Program, we may issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws. In fiscal 2007, we issued approximately $2.1 billion of short-term promissory notes (Commercial Paper Notes) pursuant to our CP Program, of which $1.4 billion remained outstanding and $1.6 billion remained as additional capacity under our CP Program as of May 31, 2007. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes ranged between two weeks and three months and the weighted average yield, including issuance costs, was 5.33% at May 31, 2007. We did not have any outstanding borrowings under our CP Program at May 31, 2006. Senior Notes Payable In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion of floating rate senior notes, of which $1.0 billion is due May 2009 (New 2009 Notes) and $1.0 billion is due May 2010 (2010 Notes). We issued the New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes to fund the redemption of the $1.5 billion of senior floating rate notes that we issued in fiscal 2006 (see below) and for general corporate purposes. The New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes bear interest at a rate of three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.02% and 0.06%, respectively, and interest is payable quarterly. The New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes may not be redeemed prior to their maturity. In January 2006, we issued $5.75 billion of senior notes consisting of $1.5 billion of floating rate senior notes due 2009 (Original 2009 Notes), $2.25 billion of 5.00% senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and $2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due 2016 (2016 Notes and together with the Original 2009 Notes and the 2011 Notes, Original Senior Notes) to finance the Siebel acquisition and for general corporate purposes. On June 16, 2006, we completed a registered exchange offer of the Original Senior Notes for registered senior notes with substantially identical terms to the Original Senior Notes. In May 2007 we redeemed the Original 2009 Notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our 2011 Notes and 2016 Notes may also be redeemed at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole premium. The 2011 Notes and 2016 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.00% and 5.25% per year, respectively. Interest is payable semi-annually for the 2011 notes and 2016 notes. The effective interest yields of the New 2009 Notes, 2010 Notes, 2011 Notes and 2016 Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) at May 31, 2007 were 5.38%, 5.42%, 5.09% and 5.33%, respectively. The Senior Notes rank pari passu with the Commercial Paper Notes and all existing and future senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation will be effectively senior to the Senior Notes and the Commercial Paper Notes. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations. In addition, we believe we could fund acquisitions, including the Agile acquisition, and repurchase common stock with our internally available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our credit facilities, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Quarterly Results of Operations Quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales compensation plans. These seasonal factors are common in the software industry. These factors have caused a 53 Table of Contents decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been the highest revenue quarter. We expect this trend to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. The following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2007 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 3,591 $ 4,163 $ 4,414 $ 5,828 Gross profit $ 1,666 $ 2,024 $ 2,197 $ 3,143 Operating income $ 943 $ 1,357 $ 1,394 $ 2,281 Net income $ 670 $ 967 $ 1,033 $ 1,604 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.13 $ 0.19 $ 0.20 $ 0.31 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.13 $ 0.18 $ 0.20 $ 0.31 Fiscal 2006 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 2,768 $ 3,292 $ 3,470 $ 4,851 Gross profit $ 1,311 $ 1,705 $ 1,779 $ 2,606 Operating income $ 712 $ 1,116 $ 1,052 $ 1,857 Net income $ 519 $ 798 $ 765 $ 1,300 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.10 $ 0.15 $ 0.15 $ 0.25 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.10 $ 0.15 $ 0.14 $ 0.24 Stock Options Our stock option program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution for each of the last three full fiscal years has been less than 2.0% and has averaged 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for the year (including options assumed in acquisitions), net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised. Some of these options, which have 10-year exercise periods, have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price. At May 31, 2007, 12% of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. Consistent with our historical practices, we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed 2.0% per year for our ongoing business. Over the last 10 years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to repay indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2007, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised option awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 8.5%. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants of up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. 54 Table of Contents Options activity from June 1, 2004 through May 31, 2007 is summarized as follows: (Shares in millions) Options outstanding at May 31, 2004 440 Options granted 171 Options assumed 204 Options exercised (264 ) Forfeitures and cancellations (117 ) Options outstanding at May 31, 2007 434 Average annualized options granted, net of forfeitures 86 Average annualized stock repurchases 165 Shares outstanding at May 31, 2007 5,107 Weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2004 through May 31, 2007 5,168 Options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2007 8.5% In the money options outstanding (based on our May 31, 2007 stock price) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2007 7.5% Average annualized options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2004 through May 31, 2007 1.7% Average annualized options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and after stock repurchases, as a percent of average shares outstanding from June 1, 2004 through May 31, 2007 -1.5% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to selected employees during the ten business-day period following the two business days after the announcement of our fiscal year-end earnings report. New Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Income Rate Risk. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we began designating newly acquired fixed income investments as available-for-sale. As a result of the available-for-sale designation, all securities purchased after May 31, 2006 are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. As of May 31, 2007, substantially all investments held are classified as available-for-sale. We generally purchase investments with relatively short maturities. Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our investments. Auction rate securities are reported on the balance sheet at par value, which equals market value, as the rate on such securities re-sets generally every 7 to 28 days. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our investments. For fiscal 2007, total interest income was $295 million with investments yielding an average 3.97% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was up approximately 93 basis points from 3.04% for fiscal 2006. If overall interest rates fell by a similar amount (93 basis points) in fiscal 2008, our interest income would decline by approximately $70 million, assuming consistent investment levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 55 Table of Contents and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2007. The cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances approximate fair value at May 31, 2007: Amortized Weighted Average (Dollars in millions) Principal Amount Interest Rate Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,218 4.08% Marketable securities 802 2.89% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 7,020 3.95% The following table includes the United States dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies. See discussion of our foreign currency risk below for a description of how we hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure. Amortized Principal Amount at May 31, (in millions) 2007 Euro $ 892 Japanese Yen 681 British Pound 371 Chinese Renminbi 336 Canadian Dollar 237 Australian Dollar 218 South African Rand 118 Other currencies 1,359 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 4,212 Interest Expense Rate Risk. Borrowings as of May 31, 2007 were $7.6 billion, consisting of $5.6 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $2.0 billion of variable rate borrowings. Our variable rate borrowings were as follows at May 31, 2007: (Dollars in millions) Borrowings Effective Interest Rate Floating rate senior notes due May 2009(1) $ 1,000 5.38% Floating rate senior notes due May 2010(1) 1,000 5.42% Total borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations $ 2,000 (1) The 2009 and 2010 Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.02% per year and 0.06% per year, respectively. Interest expense for fiscal 2007 was $343 million. Based on effective interest rates at May 31, 2007, a 50 basis point increase in interest rates on our borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest expense by approximately $17 million annually. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts, to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 90 days or less. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts (excluding our Yen equity hedge described below) are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in non-operating income, net. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. Net foreign exchange transaction gains 56 Table of Contents (losses) included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $17 million, $15 million and $(28) million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The unrealized gains (losses) of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $5 million and $(0.3) million at May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tables below present the notional amounts (at contract exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates for the outstanding forward contracts as of May 31, 2007. Notional weighted average exchange rates listed in the tables below are quoted using market conventions. All of our forward contracts mature within one year with the substantial majority maturing within 90 days or less as of May 31, 2007.

Periodically, we hedge the net assets of certain international subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the effectiveness of net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders’ equity to offset the translation results on the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion) is recognized in non-operating income, net. Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in stockholders’ equity prior to tax effects were $45 million, $23 million and $(23) million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net gain on investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were $28 million, $24 million and $14 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At May 31, 2007, we had one net investment hedge in Japanese Yen. The Yen investment hedge minimizes currency risk arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary offering of Oracle Japan. The fair value of our Yen investment hedge was $0.2 million at May 31, 2007 and 2006. As of May 31, 2007, the Yen investment hedge has a notional amount of $548 million and an exchange rate of 120.22 Yen for each United States dollar.",2023-12-30 16:56:36.903803
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2008,"Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges and Gains” for additional information about charges to earnings associated with our recent acquisitions. We expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with combining the operations of our acquired companies, which may be substantial. Additional costs may include costs of employee redeployment, relocation and retention, including salary increases or bonuses, accelerated stock-based compensation expenses and severance payments, reorganization or closure of facilities, taxes, and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services. Some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of Statement 141(R)). Statement 141(R) is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of Statement 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements. We currently believe that the adoption of Statement 141(R) will result in the recognition of certain types of expenses in our results of operations that we currently capitalize pursuant to existing accounting standards and may also impact our financial statements in other ways. We may be unable to hire enough qualified employees or we may lose key employees. We rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In the software industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. In addition, acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at Oracle. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations. We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and/or increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. 17 Table of Contents Part of our total compensation program includes stock options. Stock options are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. In addition, because we expense all stock-based compensation, we may in the future change our stock-based and other compensation practices. Some of the changes we consider from time to time include the reduction in the number of employees granted options, a reduction in the number of options granted per employee and a change to alternative forms of stock-based compensation. Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues, and have significant operations, outside of the United States. Our international operations include software development, sales, customer support, consulting, On Demand and shared administrative service centers. We are subject to a variety of risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, including those related to: • general economic conditions in each country or region; • regulatory changes; • political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; • public health risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations; • longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; • overlapping tax regimes; • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries; and • reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. In addition, compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. As the majority shareholder of i-flex solutions limited, a publicly traded Indian software company focused on the banking industry, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control or obtain financial and other information on a timely basis. We may experience foreign currency gains and losses. We conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. Our revenues and operating results have recently been favorably affected by the weakening U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results. Our foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other agreements among us and our subsidiaries and distributors, are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain transaction and translation exposures in major currencies, but we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies. 18 Table of Contents Our periodic workforce restructurings can be disruptive. We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce, including our direct sales force on which we continue to rely heavily, in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. In the past, sales force and other restructurings have generally resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues could be negatively affected. Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand may not be successful. We offer Oracle On Demand outsourcing services for our applications and database technology, delivered either at our data center facilities, at select partner data centers or at customer facilities. We also offer CRM On Demand, which is a subscription service offering that provides our customers with our CRM software functionality delivered via a hosted, web-based solution that we manage. These business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or develop them into profitable businesses. We incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand businesses in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings. These businesses are subject to a variety of risks including: • demand for these services may not meet our expectations; • we may not be able to operate these businesses at an acceptable profit level; • we manage critical customer applications, data and other confidential information through Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand; accordingly, we face increased exposure to significant damage claims and risk to future business prospects in the event of system failures, inadequate disaster recovery or loss or misappropriation of customer confidential information; • we may face regulatory exposure in certain areas such as data privacy, data security and export compliance, as well as workforce reduction claims as a result of customers transferring their IT functions to us; • the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers are unsettled, particularly in the areas of privacy and security and use of global resources; changes in these laws could affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations and could increase both the costs and risks associated with providing the services; • demand for these services may be affected by customer and media concerns about security risks, international transfers of data, government or other third-party access to data, and/or use of outsourced services providers more generally; and • our offerings may require large fixed costs such as for data centers, computers, network infrastructure and security and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these costs and generate acceptable operating margins from these offerings. We might experience significant errors or security flaws in our products and services. Despite testing prior to their release, software products frequently contain errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. The detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. If we experience errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products, we could lose revenues. In addition, we run our own business operations, Oracle On Demand, CRM On Demand and other outsourcing services, support and consulting services, on our products and networks and any security flaws, if exploited, could affect our ability to conduct internal business operations. End users, who rely on our products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses, may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally. Software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability, performance and/or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation, which could impact our future sales of products and services. In addition, we may be legally required to publicly report security breaches of our services, which could adversely impact future business prospects for those services. We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all. Developing and localizing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves 19 Table of Contents a long return on investment cycle. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all. Our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. We derive revenues from contracts with the United States government, state and local governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the United States Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. Business disruptions could affect our operating results. A significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services, including some of our On Demand offerings. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected. There are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness. As of May 31, 2008, we had an aggregate of $11.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between 2009 and 2038, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Adverse litigation results could affect our business. We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. We previously negotiated three unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS 20 Table of Contents that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the IRS from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements. These agreements are effective for fiscal years through May 31, 2006. We have submitted to the IRS a request for renewal of this Advance Pricing Agreement for the years ending May 31, 2007 through May 31, 2011. However, these agreements do not cover all elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities outside the United States. We have finalized one bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement, which was effective for the years ending May 31, 2002 through May 31, 2006 and we have submitted a renewal for the years ending May 31, 2007 through May 31, 2011. We currently are negotiating an additional bilateral agreement to cover the period from June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2008. There can be no guarantee that such negotiations will result in an agreement. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased our non-income based tax exposures. PeopleSoft’s Customer Assurance Program may expose us to substantial liabilities if triggered. In June 2003, in response to our tender offer, PeopleSoft implemented what it referred to as the “customer assurance program” or “CAP”. The CAP incorporated a provision in PeopleSoft’s standard licensing arrangement that purports to contractually burden us, as a result of our acquisition of PeopleSoft, with a contingent obligation to make payments to PeopleSoft customers should we fail to take certain business actions for a fixed period of time after this acquisition. The payment obligation, which typically expires four years from the date of the contract, is fixed at an amount generally between two and five times the license and first year support fees paid to PeopleSoft in the applicable license transaction. We concluded that, as of the date of the PeopleSoft acquisition, the penalty provisions under the CAP represented a contingent liability of ours. The aggregate potential CAP obligation as of May 31, 2008 was $1.9 billion. Some of the CAP provisions have expired or have been removed from these license arrangements. We expect the significant majority of the remaining CAP provisions to expire by the end of calendar 2008. While we have taken extensive steps to assure customers that we intend to continue developing and supporting the PeopleSoft and JD Edwards product lines and, as of May 31, 2008, we have not received any claims for CAP payments, PeopleSoft customers may assert claims for CAP payments. Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value. All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Our properties consist of owned and leased office facilities for sales, support, research and development, consulting and administrative personnel. Our headquarters facility consists of approximately 2.0 million square feet in Redwood City, California. We also own or lease office facilities for current use consisting of approximately 17.9 million square feet in various other locations in the United States and abroad. Due to our restructuring and merger integration activities over the past three fiscal years, we have vacated approximately 3.8 million square feet 21 Table of Contents or 19% of total owned and leased space. This vacated space is sublet or is being actively marketed for sublease or disposition. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The material set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders None. 22 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ORCL” and has been traded on NASDAQ since our initial public offering in 1986. According to the records of our transfer agent, we had 20,505 stockholders of record as of May 31, 2008. The following table sets forth the low and high sale price of our common stock, based on the last daily sale, in each of our last eight fiscal quarters. Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Low Sale High Sale Low Sale High Sale Price Price Price Price Fourth Quarter $ 18.44 $ 22.84 $ 16.37 $ 19.42 Third Quarter $ 18.80 $ 23.11 $ 16.29 $ 19.28 Second Quarter $ 19.36 $ 22.92 $ 15.50 $ 19.66 First Quarter $ 18.73 $ 20.78 $ 13.15 $ 15.81 Our policy has been to reinvest earnings to fund future growth, acquisitions and to repurchase our common stock pursuant to a program approved by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, we have not paid cash dividends and do not anticipate declaring cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, although our Board of Directors reviews this matter from time to time. For equity compensation plan information, please refer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual Report. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effect of our stock option and stock purchase plans. In April 2007, our Board of Directors expanded our repurchase program by $4.0 billion and, as of May 31, 2008, $2.2 billion was available for share repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions, our debt repayment obligations, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ending May 31, 2008 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our share repurchase programs: Total Number of Approximate Dollar Total Number Average Shares Purchased as Value of Shares that of Shares Price Paid Part of Publicly May Yet Be Purchased (in millions, except per share amounts) Purchased per Share Announced Programs Under the Programs March 1, 2008—March 31, 2008 8.1 $ 19.63 8.1 $ 2,550.8 April 1, 2008—April 30, 2008 8.4 $ 20.87 8.4 $ 2,376.1 May 1, 2008—May 31, 2008 7.6 $ 21.89 7.6 $ 2,209.4 Total 24.1 $ 20.76 24.1 23 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graph and Cumulative Total Return The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return on the S&P’s 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Software Index for each of the last five fiscal years ended May 31, 2008, assuming an investment of $100 at the beginning of such period and the reinvestment of any dividends.

Selected Financial Data The following table sets forth selected financial data as of and for the last five fiscal years. This selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Over the last four fiscal years, we have invested billions of dollars, including $9.4 billion in fiscal 2008, for our acquisitions of a number of companies including PeopleSoft, BEA, Siebel and Hyperion. The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our growth in revenues, income and earnings per share. As of and For The Year Ended May 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: Total revenues $ 22,430 $ 17,996 $ 14,380 $ 11,799 $ 10,156 Operating income $ 7,844 $ 5,974 $ 4,736 $ 4,022 $ 3,864 Net income $ 5,521 $ 4,274 $ 3,381 $ 2,886 $ 2,681 Earnings per share—basic $ 1.08 $ 0.83 $ 0.65 $ 0.56 $ 0.51 Earnings per share—diluted $ 1.06 $ 0.81 $ 0.64 $ 0.55 $ 0.50 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 5,133 5,170 5,196 5,136 5,215 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 5,229 5,269 5,287 5,231 5,326 Consolidated Balance Sheets Data: Working capital $ 8,074 $ 3,496 $ 5,044 (1) $ 385 (2) $ 7,064 Total assets $ 47,268 (3) $ 34,572 (3) $ 29,029 (3) $ 20,687 (3) $ 12,763 Notes payable, current and other current borrowings $ 1,001 (4) $ 1,358 (4) $ 159 $ 2,693 (4) $ 9 Notes payable and other non-current borrowings $ 10,235 (5) $ 6,235 (5) $ 5,735 (5) $ 159 $ 163 Stockholders’ equity $ 23,025 $ 16,919 $ 15,012 $ 10,837 $ 7,995 (1) Total working capital increased as of May 31, 2006 primarily due to the issuance of $5.75 billion in long-term senior notes and increased cash flows from operations. (2) Total working capital decreased as of May 31, 2005 primarily due to cash paid to acquire PeopleSoft. (3) Total assets increased as of May 31, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 primarily due to goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of BEA in fiscal 2008, Hyperion in fiscal 2007, Siebel in fiscal 2006 and PeopleSoft in fiscal 2005, as well as our profitability in all periods presented. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions. (4) Notes payable, current and other current borrowings decreased in fiscal 2008 due to repayments of amounts borrowed under our commercial paper program during fiscal 2007 partially offset by the reclassification of $1.0 billion of senior notes that mature in 2009. Notes payable, current and other current borrowings increased in fiscal 2005 due to amounts borrowed under our commercial paper program and amounts borrowed by Oracle Technology Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary. We repaid these fiscal 2005 borrowings in fiscal 2006. (5) Notes payable and other non-current borrowings increased between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2008 due to the issuances of $5.0 billion of long-term senior notes in fiscal 2008, $2.0 billion of long-term senior notes in fiscal 2007 and $5.75 billion of long-term senior notes in fiscal 2006, partially offset by redemptions of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2007. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our borrowings. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. We are the world’s largest enterprise software company. We are organized into two businesses, software and services, which are further divided into five operating segments. Each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our five operating segments follows. 25 Table of Contents Software Business Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software license revenues and (2) software license updates and product support revenues. We expect that our software business revenues will continue to increase due to continued demand for our products and due to our acquisitions, which should allow us to improve margins and profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software Licenses: We license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. The growth in new software license revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software products and acquisitions. Our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period (as provided in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q) provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business. New software license revenues represented 34%, 33% and 34% of our total revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our new software license margins have been and will continue to be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies we have acquired. Competition in the software business is intense. Our goal is to maintain a first or second position in each of our software product categories and certain industry segments as well as to grow our software revenues faster than our competitors. We believe that the features and functionality of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. We have focused on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products by improving integration, decreasing installation times, lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use. In addition, our broad portfolio of product offerings (many of which have been acquired over the past four fiscal years) helps us to offer customers the ability to gain efficiencies by consolidating their IT “software stack” with a single vendor, which reduces the number of disparate software vendors with which customers interact. Reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides our customers with a higher return on their IT investments, which we believe creates more demand for our products and services and provides us with a competitive advantage. We have also continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our software products and service levels. We believe this will lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve our goal of becoming our customers’ leading technology advisor. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period, as well as technical support assistance. In addition, we offer Oracle Unbreakable Linux Support, which provides enterprise level support for the Linux operating system and, in fiscal 2008, we introduced support for Oracle VM server virtualization software. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the renewal rate of the support contract base, (2) the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses, and (3) the support contract base assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 46% of our total revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, is our highest margin business unit. Support margins during fiscal 2008 were 85%, and accounted for 76% of our total margins over the same period. We believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will continue to grow for the following reasons: • Substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal. • Substantially all of our customers purchase license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our support contract base. Even if new software license revenue growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow assuming renewal and cancellation rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions add to our support contract base. 26 Table of Contents • Our acquisitions have increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed. We record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business acquisitions to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of $179 million, $212 million and $391 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. To the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, On Demand and education. Our services business, which represented 20%, 21% and 20% of our total revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, has significantly lower margins than our software business. Consulting: Consulting revenues have increased primarily due to an increase in application implementations resulting from higher sales of new software applications over the past year and our recent acquisitions. We expect consulting revenues to continue to grow as consulting revenues tend to lag software revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses and our new software license growth rates have generally increased over the last several quarters in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods. On Demand: On Demand includes Oracle On Demand, CRM on Demand, as well as Advanced Customer Services offerings. We believe that our On Demand offerings provide our customers flexibility in how they manage their IT environments and an additional opportunity to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive advantage. We have made and plan to continue to make investments in our On Demand business to support current and future revenue growth, which has negatively impacted On Demand margins and may continue to do so in the future. Education: The purpose of our education services is to further the adoption and usage of our software products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our software revenues. Education revenues have been impacted by personnel reductions in our customers’ information technology departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions. However, education revenues and expenses have increased in recent periods in comparison to the corresponding periods of the prior year as a result of additional education offerings related to our acquired products. Acquisitions An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Over the last four fiscal years, we have invested billions of dollars, including $9.4 billion in fiscal 2008, to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies such as BEA Systems, Inc. in fiscal 2008, Hyperion Solutions Corporation in fiscal 2007, Siebel Systems, Inc. in fiscal 2006 and PeopleSoft, Inc. in fiscal 2005. We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund additional acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our existing debt capacity, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. 27 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation • Allowances for Doubtful Accounts In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition We derive revenues from the following sources: (1) software, which includes new software license and software license updates and product support revenues, and (2) services, which include consulting, On Demand and education revenues. New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software, and exclude revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support. While the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenue when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support, which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers. Software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers purchase both software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. 28 Table of Contents Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in SOP 97-2. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions, then new software license revenues are generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees; (2) where services include significant modification or customization of the software; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. On Demand is comprised of Oracle On Demand, CRM On Demand and Advanced Customer Services. Oracle On Demand provides multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database, middleware and applications software delivered either at our data center facilities, at select partner data centers or at customer facilities. CRM On Demand is a service offering that provides our customers with our Siebel CRM software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage. Advanced Customer Services are earned by providing customers configuration and performance analysis, personalized support and annual on-site technical services. Revenue from On Demand services is recognized over the term of the service period, which is generally one year. Education revenues include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by “vendor specific objective evidence.” Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately, and for software license updates and product support services is also measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer. We may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results. We defer revenues for any undelivered elements, and recognize revenues when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed, in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for each such element. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements, we defer revenues until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered 29 Table of Contents elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software licenses and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to credit worthy customers through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. We account for the sale of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have licensed our software to these same companies (Concurrent Transaction). Software license agreements that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any software license transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length, and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize new software license revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, support obligations assumed, estimated restructuring liabilities and pre-acquisition contingencies. 30 Table of Contents Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $179 million, $212 million and $391 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year. Had we included costs for our estimated selling and research and development activities and the associated margin for unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided under our assumed support arrangements, the fair values of the support obligations would have been significantly higher than what we had recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount of software license updates and product support revenues both historically and in future periods related to these assumed support arrangements. Other significant estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management, but are generally subject to refinement during the purchase price allocation period (generally within one year of the acquisition date). To estimate restructuring expenses, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan. Decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with pre-merger activities of the companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period and as operating expenses thereafter. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies. If, during the purchase price allocation period, we are able to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation. If, as of the end of the purchase price allocation period, we are unable to 31 Table of Contents determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated. With the exception of unresolved income tax matters, after the end of the purchase price allocation period, any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre-acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined. In fiscal 2010, we will adopt FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The provisions of Statement 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, did not result in an impairment charge. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our 32 Table of Contents historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the U.S. are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the U.S. and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. As part of our accounting for business combinations, some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. On June 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. 33 Table of Contents Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. As a result of our acquisition of PeopleSoft in fiscal 2005, we inherited contingent liabilities resulting from a program PeopleSoft had implemented prior to the consummation of our acquisition of PeopleSoft (referred to as the “customer assurance program” or “CAP”). See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. In addition, we have applied the provisions of the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 in our accounting for Statement 123(R). We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. As required by Statement 123(R), we recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments issued or assumed after June 1, 2006 that are expected to vest. For all share-based payments granted or assumed beginning June 1, 2006, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. The fair value of the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to June 1, 2006 is recognized over the remaining service period using the accelerated expense attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates. Stock-based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider, each quarter, whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of our publicly traded, longest-term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by job classification. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will 34 Table of Contents receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair value of our stock awards also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. Our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method as prescribed under FASB Staff Position FAS 123R-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends. If the historical data we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily impacted by our acquisition of Hyperion in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, our acquisition of Agile Software, Inc. in our first quarter of fiscal 2008 and our acquisition of BEA in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal 2006 is impacted by our acquisition of Siebel in our third quarter of fiscal 2006, the consolidation of i-flex solutions limited at the beginning of fiscal 2007 and, to a lesser extent, our acquisition of Hyperion in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues, the amount of revenues associated with software license updates and product support, as well as On Demand services (in the fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006 comparison), and present supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains (including acquisition accounting and stock-based compensation), where applicable. Although certain revenue contributions from our acquisitions are quantifiable, we are unable to identify the following: • The contribution of the significant majority of consulting and education services revenues from acquired companies in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 (with the exception of the impact of BEA consulting and education revenues in fiscal 2008 in comparison to fiscal 2007, and i-flex and Hyperion consulting revenues and Hyperion education revenues for which we disclose the impact in fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal 2006) as the significant majority of these services have been fully integrated into our existing operations. • The contribution of expenses associated with acquired products and services in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 (with the exception of the impact of certain BEA operating expenses in fiscal 2008 in comparison to fiscal 2007 and the impact of certain i-flex and Hyperion operating expenses for which we disclose the impact in fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal 2006) as the significant majority of these services have been fully integrated into our existing operations. 35 Table of Contents We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends, the information has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • The quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to our sales force integration efforts, in particular the effect of having a single sales force offer similar products. We believe that if our sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different. • Our acquisitions in the periods presented did not result in our entry into a new line of business or product category. Therefore, we provided multiple products with substantially similar features and functionality. • Although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, amounts shown as support deferred revenue in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains (see below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect on May 31, 2007, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, our financial statements would reflect revenues of $1.57 million in fiscal 2008 (using 1.57 as the exchange rate) and $1.35 million in fiscal 2007 (using 1.35 as the exchange rate). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2008 results using the fiscal 2007 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual results as reported and based on constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 Actual Constant 2007 Actual Constant 2006 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 11,330 20% 18% $ 9,460 24% 23% $ 7,652 EMEA(1) 7,945 32% 20% 6,037 28% 20% 4,708 Asia Pacific 3,155 26% 18% 2,499 24% 21% 2,020 Total revenues 22,430 25% 19% 17,996 25% 22% 14,380 Total Operating Expenses 14,586 21% 17% 12,022 25% 22% 9,644 Total Operating Margin $ 7,844 31% 22% $ 5,974 26% 21% $ 4,736 Total Operating Margin % 35% 33% 33% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 51% 53% 53% EMEA(1) 35% 34% 33% Asia Pacific 14% 13% 14% Total Revenues by Business: Software $ 17,843 26% 19% $ 14,211 23% 20% $ 11,541 Services 4,587 21% 15% 3,785 33% 29% 2,839 Total revenues $ 22,430 25% 19% $ 17,996 25% 22% $ 14,380 % Revenues by Business: Software 80% 79% 80% Services 20% 21% 20% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa 36 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Total revenues increased in fiscal 2008 due to increased demand for our products and services offerings and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. The growth in our total revenues was positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points in fiscal 2008 due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major international currencies. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues contributed 38% to the growth in total revenues, software license updates and product support revenues contributed 45% and services revenues contributed 17%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 50% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 37% and Asia Pacific contributed 13%. Total operating expenses were adversely affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels (primarily resulting from our fiscal 2007 acquisitions, Agile in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and, to a lesser extent, BEA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008), as well as higher commissions and bonuses associated with increased revenues, earnings and headcount levels. In addition, operating expenses also increased in fiscal 2008 due to higher expenses from the amortization of intangible assets and additional stock-based compensation resulting from a higher fair value of grants issued in fiscal 2008 (caused primarily by our higher stock price) and the acceleration of vesting of certain acquired stock awards upon employee terminations pursuant to the original terms of those awards. Total operating expenses in fiscal 2007 were also reduced by a $52 million benefit as a result of a settlement of an acquired legal contingency from PeopleSoft for less than the amount accrued as of the end of the purchase price allocation period. The increases in operating expenses during fiscal 2008 were partially offset by a $57 million gain on property sale and a $127 million reduction of in-process research and development from our fiscal 2008 acquisitions in comparison to our fiscal 2007 acquisitions. Total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal 2008. The growth in our operating margin in fiscal 2008 was the result of our revenue growth, both organic and from acquisitions, and the relatively fixed nature of our cost structure in the short term. In addition, our operating margin growth was favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 9 percentage points. International operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar against certain major international currencies. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Total revenues increased in fiscal 2007 due to increased demand for our products and services offerings and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. Total revenues were positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 3 percentage points in fiscal 2007 due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major international currencies. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues contributed 27% to the growth in total revenues, software license updates and product support revenues contributed 47% and services revenues contributed 26%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 56% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 14%. Operating expenses were adversely affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 3 percentage points. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels (primarily resulting from our acquisitions), as well as higher commissions and travel and entertainment expenses associated with both increased revenues and headcount levels. In addition, operating expenses also increased in fiscal 2007 due to higher amortization costs of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses related to our adoption of Statement 123(R) at the beginning of fiscal 2007. The aforementioned increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring expenses and the settlement of a PeopleSoft contingency that provided a $52 million benefit to our operating expenses (see Acquisition Related and Other Expenses discussion below). Operating margins as a percentage of total revenues were flat in fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal 2006 and were favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points. Our revenues grew at a faster rate than our operating expenses, excluding the impact of amortization costs of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses. The increases in those cost categories offset the slower growth in our other operating expenses. 37 Table of Contents Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges and Gains To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Results of Operations” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results include the following business combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions as well as certain other significant expense and income items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Support deferred revenues(1) $ 179 $ 212 $ 391 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 1,212 878 583 Acquisition related and other(3)(5) 124 140 137 Restructuring(4) 41 19 85 Stock-based compensation(5) 257 198 31 Income tax effect(6) (535 ) (414 ) (362 ) $ 1,278 $ 1,033 $ 865 (1) In connection with purchase price allocations related to our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amounts of $179 million, $212 million and $391 million in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Approximately $205 million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts assumed will not be recognized in fiscal 2009 that would have otherwise been recognized by the acquired businesses as independent entities, due to the application of business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these support contracts, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contract value over the support renewal period. (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions, primarily PeopleSoft, BEA, Siebel, Hyperion and i-flex. As of May 31, 2008, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets are as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2009 $ 1,660 Fiscal 2010 1,550 Fiscal 2011 1,266 Fiscal 2012 1,126 Fiscal 2013 962 Thereafter 1,831 Total $ 8,395 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of in-process research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, personnel related costs for transitional employees, certain business combination contingency adjustments after the purchase price allocation period has ended, and certain other operating expenses (income), net. For fiscal 2008, acquisition related and other expenses include a gain on property sale of $57 million and, for fiscal 2007, acquisition related and other expenses include a benefit of $52 million related to the settlement of a pre-acquisition lawsuit against PeopleSoft (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). (4) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2008 relate to Oracle employee severance in connection with restructuring plans initiated in the second quarter, and amended in the fourth quarter, of fiscal 2008. Restructuring costs during fiscal 2007 relate to an Oracle-based restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 for which additional expenses were recorded during fiscal 2007. (5) Stock-based compensation is included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2008 2007 2006 Sales and marketing $ 51 $ 38 $ 8 Software license updates and product support 10 11 3 Cost of services 13 15 7 Research and development 114 85 13 General and administrative 69 49 — Subtotal 257 198 31 Acquisition related and other 112 9 18 Total $ 369 $ 207 $ 49 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested options assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those options. At the beginning of fiscal 2007, we adopted Statement 123(R) under the modified prospective method. Statement 123(R) requires us to record non-cash operating expenses associated with stock awards at their estimated fair values. Prior to our Statement 123(R) adoption, we were required to record stock-based compensation expenses at intrinsic values and substantially all of our stock-based compensation expense related to options assumed from acquisitions. In accordance with the modified prospective method, our financial statements for prior periods (i.e. fiscal 2006) have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the changes in methodology to expense options at fair values in accordance with Statement 123(R). (6) The income tax effects on the above presented charges and gains were calculated based on our effective tax rates of 29.5%, 28.6% and 29.7% in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Software Software includes new software licenses and software license updates and product support. New Software Licenses: New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware as well as our application software products. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Sales and marketing expenses are largely personnel-related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software products, and also include marketing program costs and amortization of intangible assets.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues grew in all major product lines and across all geographies, with database and middleware revenues contributing 55% to the increase in new software license revenues and applications revenues contributing 45%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 52%, EMEA contributed 39% and Asia Pacific contributed 9% to the increase in new software license revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, database and middleware revenues grew 17% in fiscal 2008 as a result of increased demand for our database and middleware products as well as incremental revenues from acquired 39 Table of Contents companies. Hyperion products contributed $103 million, BEA products contributed $93 million, Stellent products contributed $37 million, Tangosol products contributed $18 million and other recently acquired products contributed $2 million to the total database and middleware revenues growth in fiscal 2008. On a constant currency basis, applications revenues increased 33% in fiscal 2008 due to continued strengthening of our competitive position in the applications software segment of the software industry as a result of our broad portfolio of product offerings to a diverse customer base and incremental revenues from acquired companies. Hyperion products contributed $199 million, Agile products contributed $58 million, Metasolv products contributed $14 million, and other recently acquired products contributed $42 million to the total applications revenue growth in fiscal 2008. New software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million grew by 42% in fiscal 2008 and increased from 46% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2007 to 51% in fiscal 2008. Sales and marketing expenses were adversely impacted by 5 percentage points of unfavorable currency variations during fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher salaries, benefits and travel expenses resulting from increased headcount, higher commissions expenses associated with both increased revenues and headcount levels, and an increase in planned marketing program expenses. Sales and marketing expenses include $45 million in expenses from BEA in fiscal 2008. These increases were partially offset by a $42 million reduction in litigation related expenses resulting primarily from the settlement of certain legal matters during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Total new software license margin as a percentage of revenues increased due to our new software licenses revenues growth rate and a favorable foreign currency impact, partially offset by higher growth rates in our amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues grew in all major product lines and across all geographies. Database and middleware revenues contributed 57% to the increase in new software license revenues, while applications revenues contributed 43%. The Americas contributed 50%, EMEA contributed 33% and Asia Pacific contributed 17% to the increase in new software license revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, database and middleware revenues grew 12% as a result of increased demand for our database and middleware products as well as incremental revenues from acquired companies. Siebel products contributed incremental revenues of $48 million, Stellent products contributed $26 million, Hyperion products contributed $16 million and other recently acquired products contributed $19 million to the total database and middleware revenues growth in fiscal 2007. On a constant currency basis, applications revenues increased 29% as a result of the strengthening of our competitive position in the applications software segment of the software industry and incremental revenues from acquired companies. Siebel products contributed $130 million, i-flex products contributed $50 million, Hyperion products contributed $27 million, Portal products contributed $22 million, Demantra products contributed $21 million and other recently acquired products contributed $22 million to the total applications revenues growth. New software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million grew by 24% in fiscal 2007 and increased from 45% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2006 to 46% in fiscal 2007. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher personnel related expenses associated with increased headcount, as well as higher commissions expenses associated with both increased revenues and headcount levels. Total new software license margin as a percentage of revenues declined as our expenses, including amortization costs of intangible assets, grew at a faster rate than our revenues. Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our 40 Table of Contents intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2008 as a result of the addition of software license updates and product support contracts associated with new software licenses sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and over the course of fiscal 2008, the renewal of substantially all of the customer base eligible for renewal in the current fiscal year and incremental revenues from the expansion of our customer base from acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 53%, EMEA contributed 36% and Asia Pacific contributed 11% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. Software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2008 include incremental revenues of $303 million from Hyperion, $38 million from BEA, $38 million from Agile, $30 million from Stellent, $25 million from Metasolv, and $46 million from other recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed to their estimated fair value at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $179 million, $212 million and $391 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities, were not recognized in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year. Software license updates and product support expenses were adversely impacted by 3 percentage points of unfavorable currency variations during fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support expenses increased due to higher salary and benefits associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer base, higher bonuses and commissions due to increased revenues, and higher amortization expenses resulting from additional intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Software license updates and product support expenses include $7 million of expense growth from BEA in fiscal 2008. Total software license updates and product support margin as a percentage of revenues 41 Table of Contents increased slightly as our revenues grew faster than expenses, but were partially offset by a higher growth rate in our amortization of intangible assets expenses. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as a result of the addition of software license updates and product support contracts associated with new software licenses sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and over the course of fiscal 2007, the renewal of substantially all of the customer base eligible for renewal in fiscal 2007 and incremental revenues from the expansion of our customer base from acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 59%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. Software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2007 include revenue growth of $310 million from Siebel, $37 million from i-flex, $19 million from Hyperion, and $55 million from other recently acquired companies. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support expenses increased due to higher salary and benefits associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer base, higher amortization expenses resulting from additional intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and higher stock-based compensation expenses. Software license updates and product support expenses include $16 million in incremental expenses from both i-flex and Hyperion. Total software license updates and product support margin as a percentage of revenues remained constant as intangible asset amortization expenses and stock-based compensation expenses grew much faster than revenues and offset the lower growth in other operating expenses. Services Services consist of consulting, On Demand and education. Consulting: Consulting revenues are earned by providing services to customers in the design, implementation, deployment and upgrade of our database and middleware software products as well as applications software products. The cost of providing consulting services consists primarily of personnel related expenditures.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting revenues increased during fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in application product implementations associated with the sales of our application software products and incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions, primarily Hyperion and BEA. BEA added $16 million to our consulting revenue growth in fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 36%, EMEA contributed 35% and Asia Pacific contributed 29% to the increase in consulting revenues. Consulting expenses were adversely impacted by 6 percentage points of unfavorable currency variations during fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting expenses increased during fiscal 2008 as a result of higher personnel related expenses attributable to higher headcount levels and third party contractor expenses that supported our increase in revenues. BEA added $16 million to our consulting expense growth in fiscal 2008. Total consulting margin as a percentage of revenues remained constant during fiscal 2008 as margin improvements in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were offset by expense growth in the Americas region and for i-flex and an increase in our amortization of intangible asset expenses. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting revenues increased during fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in our application product implementations associated with the increase in sales of our application software products and incremental revenues from our acquisitions, including $359 million of incremental revenues from i-flex, whom we acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2007, and $16 million of incremental revenues from Hyperion. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to the increase in consulting revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting expenses increased in fiscal 2007 as a result of higher personnel related expenses attributable to higher headcount levels and third-party contractor expenses. Consulting expenses included $281 million of incremental expenses from i-flex and $17 million from Hyperion. Total consulting margin as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to higher margins contributed by i-flex.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, On Demand revenues increased in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in each service category’s subscription base as more customers engaged us to provide IT outsourcing solutions. On a constant currency basis, Oracle On Demand, Advanced Customer Services and CRM On Demand contributed 44%, 42% and 14%, respectively. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 53%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 18% to the increase in On Demand revenues. Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, On Demand expenses increased in fiscal 2008 due to higher salaries and benefits expenses associated with increased headcount, and higher technology infrastructure related expenses to support the expansion of our customer base. These expense increases were partially offset by a shift of certain U.S. based costs to global support centers in lower cost countries. Total On Demand margin as a percentage of revenues improved primarily as a result of our Oracle On Demand business, which increased revenues while managing operating expenses to a level consistent with fiscal 2007 and the favorable impact of currency effects during the period. Our Advanced Customer Services and CRM On Demand margin percentages also improved modestly in comparison to fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, On Demand revenues increased in fiscal 2007 due to higher Advanced Customer Services revenues, and the expansion of our subscription base in both Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand services. Advanced Customer Services revenues contributed 46% of the growth, while Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand contributed 33% and 21%, respectively. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 32% and Asia Pacific contributed 13% to the increase in On Demand revenues. Advanced Customer Services and CRM On Demand revenues included $50 million and $31 million, respectively, of incremental revenues from Siebel in fiscal 2007. 44 Table of Contents On Demand expenses were adversely impacted by 5 percentage points of unfavorable currency variations during fiscal 2007. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, On Demand expenses increased due to higher personnel related expenditures, higher amortization expenses resulting from intangible assets, as well as higher IT related costs to support the expansion of our customer base. On Demand expense growth also reflects a full year of expenses from Siebel On Demand employees (in comparison to only four months in fiscal 2006). Total On Demand margin as a percentage of revenues decreased, primarily driven by more rapid growth in personnel related expenses in comparison to revenues, and to a lesser extent, growth in IT related expenditures for Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand, as well as amortization of intangible assets. Advanced Customer Services operating margins remained flat compared with the prior year while operating losses in both Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand increased.

BEA contributed $2 million to our revenue growth in fiscal 2008. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 39%, EMEA contributed 36% and Asia Pacific contributed 25% to the increase in education revenues. Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 7 percentage points, education expenses increased due to higher personnel related expenses during the first half of fiscal 2008 and were partially offset by lower personnel related expenses in the second half of fiscal 2008 as a result of restructuring actions taken. Education expenses also increased due to third party contractor expenses and royalty fees associated with increased revenues and included $2 million of incremental expenses from BEA. Education margin as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in fiscal 2008 as revenue growth exceeded expense growth. 45 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, education revenues grew in fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in customer training on the use of our application products, as well as $5 million of incremental revenues from Hyperion. The Americas contributed 46%, EMEA contributed 26% and Asia Pacific contributed 28% to the increase in education revenues. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, education expenses increased in fiscal 2007 due to incremental headcount and associated personnel related expenditures, as well as higher third party contractor expenses and royalty fees associated with increased revenues. Education expenses also included $3 million of incremental expenses from Hyperion. Total education margin as a percentage of revenues decreased as expenses grew at a higher rate than revenues.

The increase in our headcount was the combined result of our recent acquisitions and our hiring of additional resources to develop new functionality for our existing products. Research and development headcount as of the end of fiscal 2008 increased by approximately 2,550 employees in comparison to fiscal 2007, and included approximately 950 employees from BEA. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, research and development expenses increased due to higher salary and benefits expenses associated with higher headcount levels, increased stock-based compensation expenses due to our adoption of Statement 123(R) at the beginning of fiscal 2007, and increased external contractor expenses. Our growth in research and development expenses was impacted by our acquisitions, including $25 million from i-flex and $19 million from Hyperion. Research and development headcount increased by approximately 3,600 employees in comparison to fiscal 2006, and included approximately 1,200 employees from i-flex and 600 employees from Hyperion. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for information technology, finance, legal and human resources support functions. 46 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 Actual Constant 2007 Actual Constant 2006 General and Administrative(1) $ 739 15% 10% $ 643 16% 13% $ 555 Stock-based compensation 69 40% 40% 49 * * — Total expenses $ 808 17% 12% $ 692 25% 22% $ 555 % of Total Revenues 4% 4% 4% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation * Not meaningful Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal 2008 as a result of higher personnel related costs associated with increased headcount to support our expanding operations and increased stock-based compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses include $4 million of expenses from BEA in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal 2007 as a result of higher personnel related costs associated with increased headcount to support our expanding operations, the recognition of stock-based compensation expenses due to the adoption of Statement 123(R) at the beginning of fiscal 2007 and increased professional services fees, primarily litigation related expenses. General and administrative expenses included incremental expenses of $25 million from i-flex and $10 million from Hyperion in fiscal 2007.

See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our intangible assets (including weighted average useful lives) and related amortization expenses. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal 2007 due to the amortization of purchased intangibles from Hyperion, Siebel (a full year of amortization in fiscal 2007 in comparison to four months in fiscal 2006), i-flex and other acquisitions that we consummated since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of in-process research and development expenses, integration related professional services, stock-based compensation expenses, personnel related costs for transitional employees, certain business combination contingency adjustments after the purchase price allocation period has ended, and certain other expenses (income), net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses relate to unvested options assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those options. 47 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2008 Actual Constant 2007 Actual Constant 2006 In-process research and development $ 24 -84% -84% $ 151 94% 94% $ 78 Transitional employee related expenses 32 34% 33% 24 -20% -20% 30 Stock-based compensation 112 1,144% 1,144% 9 -50% -50% 18 Professional fees 7 -13% -13% 8 -27% -27% 11 Business combination contingency adjustments 6 111% 111% (52 ) * * — Gain on sale of property (57 ) * * — * * — Total acquisition related and other expenses $ 124 -11% -12% $ 140 2% 2% $ 137 * Not meaningful Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Acquisition related and other expenses decreased during fiscal 2008 due to lower in-process research and development acquired as a part of our fiscal 2008 acquisitions in comparison to our fiscal 2007 acquisitions and a $57 million gain on a property sale in December 2007 (see Note 1 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). These decreases to acquisition related and other expenses were partially offset by higher transitional employee related expenses and increased stock-based compensation expenses due to the acceleration of certain acquired employee stock options pursuant to the terms of those options. Business combination contingency adjustments in fiscal 2007 included a $52 million benefit relating to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against PeopleSoft on behalf of the U.S. government. This lawsuit was filed in October 2003, prior to our acquisition of PeopleSoft, and represented a pre-acquisition contingency that we identified and assumed in connection with our acquisition of PeopleSoft. We settled this lawsuit in October 2006, which was subsequent to the purchase price allocation period, for approximately $98 million. Accordingly, we included the difference between the amount accrued as of the end of the purchase price allocation period and the settlement amount as a $52 million benefit to our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Acquisition related charges increased primarily due to in-process research and development charges resulting from our acquisitions of Hyperion, i-flex and others in fiscal 2007. This increase was almost entirely offset by a $52 million benefit as described above. Restructuring expenses: Restructuring expenses consist of Oracle employee severance costs and Oracle duplicate facilities closures that were initiated to improve our cost structure as a result of acquisitions. For additional information regarding the Oracle restructuring plans, as well as restructuring activities of our acquired companies, please see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our 2008 Plan was amended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 to include the expected effects resulting from our acquisition of BEA. The total estimated costs associated with the 2008 Plan are approximately $111 million and are primarily related to employee severance. The majority of these estimated costs are expected to be incurred over the course of fiscal 2009. Our estimated costs are preliminary and may be subject to change in future periods. We incurred restructuring expenses of $41 million in fiscal 2008, pursuant to the 2008 Plan (see Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2007 relate to Oracle employee severance and facility closures that were recorded in those periods and were a part of a restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. 48 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Restructuring expenses decreased in fiscal 2007 as we initiated the majority of the actions pursuant to the Fiscal 2006 Oracle Restructuring Plan during fiscal 2006. Our management did not initiate any new plans to restructure our Oracle-based operations during fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2007 due to higher average borrowings in fiscal 2007 related to our $5.75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in January 2006 (of which $1.5 billion was redeemed by us in May 2007), our $2.1 billion of commercial paper issuances (of which approximately $1.4 billion remained outstanding as of May 31, 2007) and our $2.0 billion of senior notes issued in May 2007. Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains, the minority owners’ share in the net profits of our majority-owned i-flex and Oracle Japan subsidiaries, and other income including net gains related to our marketable securities and other investments.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Non-operating income, net increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher interest income attributable to an increase in average interest rates (the weighted average interest rate earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased from 3.04% in fiscal 2006 to 3.97% in fiscal 2007), partially offset by higher minority interests’ share in the net profits of i-flex and our Oracle Japan majority-owned subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes: The effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation. 49 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 Actual Constant 2007 Actual Constant 2006 Provision for income taxes $ 2,313 35% 32% $ 1,712 20% 20% $ 1,429 Effective tax rate 29.5% 28.6% 29.7% Provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 due to higher earnings before taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Working capital $ 8,074 131% $ 3,496 -31% $ 5,044 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 11,043 57% 7,020 -8% 7,605 Working capital: The increase in working capital in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting from the issuance of $5.0 billion of long-term senior notes in April 2008, additional cash and trade receivables generated from our operations and our adoption of FIN 48, which resulted in a significant reclassification of certain short-term tax liabilities to long-term (see Note 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). These increases in working capital were partially offset by cash used in fiscal 2008 to pay for our acquisitions (primarily BEA) and to repurchase our common stock. The decrease in working capital in fiscal 2007 was primarily a result of cash used to pay for our acquisitions and stock repurchases, partially offset by increases in operating cash flows from higher sales volumes, proceeds received from employee stock option exercises and an increase in our long-term borrowings. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations and U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities include $10.1 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2008. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2008 in comparison to May 31, 2007 is due to the issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in April 2008 and an increase in our operating cash flows resulting primarily from an increase in net income, partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions (primarily BEA), net repayments of our short-term commercial paper notes, and repurchases of our common stock. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2007 in comparison to May 31, 2006 is a result of cash used to pay for acquisitions and stock repurchases during fiscal 2007, partially offset by an increase in our operating cash flows from higher net income, increases in our short-term and long-term borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises. Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 63 days at May 31, 2008 compared with 62 days at May 31, 2007. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the adjustment to reduce software license updates and product support revenues related to adjusting the carrying value for deferred support revenues acquired to fair value. Our increase in days sales outstanding is primarily due to differences in the timing of completion of certain sales transactions between years and a slight decline in timeliness of collections in certain countries.

We also generate significant cash from new software license sales and, to a lesser extent, services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures as well as payments related to taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by increased accounts receivable due to fourth quarter fiscal 2008 revenue growth. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by increased accounts receivable due to fourth quarter fiscal 2007 revenue growth, cash payments to terminate leases associated with excess facilities assumed in the Siebel acquisition, and the settlement of a pre-acquisition lawsuit filed against PeopleSoft. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions (primarily BEA), net of cash acquired and an increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from maturities). Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2007 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. We paid cash to purchase a number of companies in fiscal 2007 including Hyperion, Stellent, MetaSolv, and Portal Software, and to purchase additional equity securities in i-flex. Cash outflows in fiscal 2006 primarily relate to our acquisition of Siebel and our equity investment purchases in i-flex. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt obligations as well as stock repurchases and proceeds from stock option exercise activity. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2008 increased in comparison to cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2007 due to the issuance of $5.0 billion of long-term senior notes in April 2008, additional proceeds from stock option exercises, excess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation arrangements, and decreased spending on stock repurchases, and were partially offset by $1.4 billion of net repayments of short-term commercial paper notes. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2007 primarily relates to an increase in stock repurchases and lower borrowings, net of repayments, when compared with fiscal 2006. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Cash provided by operating activities $ 7,402 34% $ 5,520 22% $ 4,541 Capital expenditures(1) $ (243 ) -24% $ (319 ) 35% $ (236 ) Free cash flow $ 7,159 38% $ 5,201 21% $ 4,305 Net income $ 5,521 29% $ 4,274 26% $ 3,381 Free cash flow as a percent of net income 130% 122% 127% (1) Represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 51 Table of Contents Long-Term Customer Financing We offer our customers the option to acquire our software products and service offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell contracts that we have financed on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, $1.1 billion, $891 million and $618 million or approximately 15%, 15% and 13%, respectively, of our new software license revenues were financed through our financing division. Contractual Obligations The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2008: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 11,250 $ 1,000 $ 1,000 $ 2,250 $ — $ 1,250 $ 5,750 Capital leases(2) 2 1 1 — — — — Interest payments on borrowings(1) 5,509 602 552 506 392 392 3,065 Operating leases(3) 1,713 432 370 259 187 124 341 Purchase obligations(4) 432 395 17 4 3 3 10 Funding commitments(5) 3 3 — — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 18,909 $ 2,433 $ 1,940 $ 3,019 $ 582 $ 1,769 $ 9,166 (1) Our borrowings (excluding capital leases) consist of the following as of May 31, 2008: Principal Balance Floating rate senior notes due May 2009 $ 1,000 Floating rate senior notes due May 2010 1,000 5.00% senior notes due January 2011, net of discount of $4 2,246 4.95% senior notes due April 2013 1,250 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $9 1,991 5.75% senior notes due April 2018, net of discount of $1 2,499 6.50% senior notes due April 2038, net of discount of $2 1,248 Total borrowings $ 11,234 Our floating rate senior notes due May 2009 and May 2010 bore interest at a rate of 2.70% and 2.74%, respectively, as of May 31, 2008. In September 2007, we entered into two interest-rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floating rate senior notes due May 2009 and May 2010 so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.62% and 4.59%, respectively. Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreements and include estimates based on the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2008 for variable rate borrowings after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements. (2) Represents remaining payments under capital leases assumed from acquisitions. (3) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $355 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2008. (4) Represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. (5) Represents the maximum additional capital we may need to contribute toward our venture fund investments, which are payable upon demand. 52 Table of Contents Excluded from the table above are agreements that we entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the first quarter of fiscal 2009 in which we agreed to acquire a number of companies for estimated total cash consideration of $407 million. We expect these transactions to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. As of May 31, 2008, we have $1.7 billion of unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant taxing authorities to pay approximately $90 million of these liabilities. Although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made, some or all may be made in fiscal 2009. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of these liabilities will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2009. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations. In addition, we believe we could fund our acquisitions, including the aforementioned acquisitions that we expect to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, and repurchase common stock with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, our existing available debt capacity, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Recent Financing Activities Senior Notes In April 2008, we issued $5.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes, of which $1.25 billion of 4.95% senior notes is due April 2013 (2013 Notes), $2.5 billion of 5.75% senior notes is due April 2018 (2018 Notes), and $1.25 billion of 6.50% senior notes is due April 2038 (2038 Notes). We issued these senior notes to finance the acquisition of BEA and for general corporate purposes. Some or all of the 2013 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes may be redeemed at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole premium. The 2013 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2038 Notes pay interest semi-annually. In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion of floating rate senior notes, of which $1.0 billion is due May 2009 (New 2009 Notes) and $1.0 billion is due May 2010 (2010 Notes). We issued the New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes to fund the redemption of the $1.5 billion of senior floating rate notes that we issued in fiscal 2006 (see below) and for general corporate purposes. The New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes bear interest at a rate of three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.02% and 0.06%, respectively, and interest is payable quarterly. The New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes may not be redeemed prior to their maturity. In January 2006, we issued $5.75 billion of senior notes consisting of $1.5 billion of floating rate senior notes due 2009 (Original 2009 Notes), $2.25 billion of 5.00% senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and $2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due 2016 (2016 Notes and together with the Original 2009 Notes and the 2011 Notes, Original Senior Notes) to finance the Siebel acquisition and for general corporate purposes. On June 16, 2006, we completed a registered exchange offer of the Original Senior Notes for registered senior notes with substantially identical terms to the Original Senior Notes. In May 2007 we redeemed the Original 2009 Notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our 2011 Notes and 2016 Notes may also be redeemed at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole premium. Interest is payable semi-annually for the 2011 notes and 2016 notes. The effective interest yields of the New 2009 Notes, 2010 Notes, 2011 Notes, 2013 Notes, 2016 Notes, 2018 Notes, and 2038 Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) at May 31, 2008 were 2.70%, 2.74%, 5.08%, 4.96%, 5.33%, 5.76% and 6.52%, respectively. In September 2007, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with the New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes 53 Table of Contents so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.62% and 4.59%, respectively, until maturity. The Senior Notes rank pari passu with any Commercial Paper Notes (defined below) that we may issue and all existing and future senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation will be effectively senior to the Senior Notes and any Commercial Paper Notes that we may issue. Commercial Paper Program In March 2008, we increased our commercial paper program to $5.0 billion from $3.0 billion (the CP Program). The original dealer agreements entered into in February 2006 with each of Banc of America Securities LLC, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement entered into in February 2006 with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, remained in effect and were not changed. Under the CP Program, we may issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes (Commercial Paper Notes) pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws. In fiscal 2008 and 2007, we issued approximately $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion of Commercial Paper Notes, respectively, of which none and $1.4 billion remained outstanding as of May 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of May 31, 2008, we had $5.0 billion of capacity remaining under our CP Program. Revolving Credit Agreements In March 2008, we entered into a $2.0 billion, 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement with Wachovia Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders (2008 Credit Agreement). The 2008 Credit Agreement was in addition to an existing $3.0 billion, five-year Revolving Credit Agreement with substantially the same parties that we entered into in March 2006 (the 2006 Credit Agreement and, collectively with the 2008 Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreements). The Credit Agreements provide for unsecured revolving credit facilities, which can also be used to backstop any Commercial Paper Notes (see above) that we may issue and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreements, we may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the facilities at any time during the terms of the Credit Agreements. Interest for the Credit Agreements is based on either (a) a LIBOR-based formula or (b) a formula based on Wachovia’s prime rate or on the federal funds effective rate. Any amounts drawn pursuant to the 2008 Credit Agreement are due on March 17, 2009 (we may, upon the agreement of the lenders, extend the facility by up to two times in succession). Any amounts drawn pursuant to the 2006 Credit Agreement are due on March 14, 2011. No amounts were outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreements as of May 31, 2008 and 2007. A total of $5.0 billion remained available pursuant to the Credit Agreements at May 31, 2008. The Credit Agreements contain certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including the requirement that our total net debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 45%. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the Credit Agreements may be declared immediately due and payable and the Credit Agreements may be terminated. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreements’ covenants as of May 31, 2008. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the software industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter. We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated 54 Table of Contents financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2008 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 29 May 31 Revenues $ 4,529 $ 5,313 $ 5,349 $ 7,239 Gross profit $ 2,111 $ 2,690 $ 2,731 $ 4,028 Operating income $ 1,217 $ 1,782 $ 1,875 $ 2,971 Net income $ 840 $ 1,303 $ 1,340 $ 2,037 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.16 $ 0.25 $ 0.26 $ 0.40 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.16 $ 0.25 $ 0.26 $ 0.39 Fiscal 2007 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 3,591 $ 4,163 $ 4,414 $ 5,828 Gross profit $ 1,666 $ 2,024 $ 2,197 $ 3,143 Operating income $ 943 $ 1,357 $ 1,394 $ 2,281 Net income $ 670 $ 967 $ 1,033 $ 1,604 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.13 $ 0.19 $ 0.20 $ 0.31 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.13 $ 0.18 $ 0.20 $ 0.31 Stock Options Our stock option program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2005 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.5% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options granted and assumed, net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised. Some of these options, which have 10-year exercise periods, have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price of our common stock. At May 31, 2008, 11% of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. Consistent with our historical practices, we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed 2.0% per year for our ongoing business. Over the last 10 years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to repay indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2008, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised option awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 7.3%. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual 55 Table of Contents stock option grants up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option activity from June 1, 2005 through May 31, 2008 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Options outstanding at May 31, 2005 469 Options granted 190 Options assumed 143 Options exercised (328 ) Forfeitures and cancellations (96 ) Options outstanding at May 31, 2008 378 Average annualized options granted and assumed net of forfeitures 79 Average annualized stock repurchases 159 Shares outstanding at May 31, 2008 5,150 Weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2005 through May 31, 2008 5,166 Options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2008 7.3% In the money options outstanding (based on our May 31, 2008 stock price) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2008 6.6% Weighted average annualized options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2005 through May 31, 2008 1.5% Weighted average annualized options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2005 through May 31, 2008 -1.6% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to certain key employees. These annual option grants are made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk: We generally purchase debt security investments with relatively short maturities (see a description of our debt securities held in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presented above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our investments. For fiscal 2008, total interest income was $337 million with investments yielding an average 3.44% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was down by 53 basis points from 3.97% for fiscal 2007. If overall interest rates fell by 100 basis points from our average of 3.44% during fiscal 2008, our annual interest income would decline by approximately $95 million, assuming consistent investment levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2008. The cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are recorded at their fair values at May 31, 2008. Fair Value of Available-for-Sale Weighted Average (Dollars in millions) Securities Interest Rate Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,262 2.35% Marketable securities 2,781 2.71% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 11,043 2.44% 56 Table of Contents The following table includes the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies. See discussion of our foreign currency risk below for a description of how we hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure. U.S. Dollar Equivalent at (in millions) May 31, 2008 Euro $ 1,941 Japanese Yen 801 British Pound 705 Chinese Renminbi 477 Indian Rupee 357 Canadian Dollar 275 Australian Dollar 258 Other foreign currencies 1,629 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 6,443 Our borrowings as of May 31, 2008 were $11.2 billion, consisting of $9.2 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $2.0 billion of variable rate borrowings. Our variable rate borrowings were as follows at May 31, 2008: (Dollars in millions) Borrowings Interest Rate Floating rate senior notes due May 2009(1) $ 1,000 2.70% Floating rate senior notes due May 2010(1) 1,000 2.74% Total borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations $ 2,000 (1) The 2009 and 2010 Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.02% per year and 0.06% per year, respectively. In September 2007, we entered into two interest-rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floating rate senior notes due May 2009 and May 2010 so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively becomes fixed at a rate of 4.62% and 4.59%, respectively. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the senior notes that the swap agreements pertain to match, including the notional amounts, interest rate reset dates, maturity dates and underlying market indices. The fair values of the aforementioned interest rate swaps totaled an unrealized loss of $24 million, net of tax effects, at May 31, 2008. We are accounting for these swaps as hedges pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The unrealized losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and the corresponding fair value payables are included in other current and long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk: We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 90 days or less. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes included in non-operating income, net (the effective portion of our Yen equity hedge described below is included in stockholders’ equity). Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. Net foreign exchange transaction gains included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $17 million, $17 million and $15 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net unrealized gains of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $3 million and $5 million at May 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tables below present the notional amounts (at contract exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates for our outstanding forward contracts as of May 31, 2008 and exclude our net 57 Table of Contents investment hedge contract described further below. Notional weighted average exchange rates listed in the tables below are quoted using market conventions. All of our forward contracts mature within one year with the substantial majority maturing within 90 days as of May 31, 2008.

We measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders’ equity to offset the translation results on the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the excluded portion and the ineffective portion, if any) is recognized in non-operating income, net. Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in stockholders’ equity, net of tax effects, were $(53) million, $28 million and $14 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net gains on investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were $23 million, $28 million and $24 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At May 31, 2008, we had one net investment hedge in Japanese Yen. The Yen investment hedge minimizes currency risk arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary offering of our majority owned subsidiary, Oracle Japan. The fair value of our Yen investment hedge was nominal at May 31, 2008 and 2007. As of May 31, 2008, the Yen investment hedge had a notional amount of $633 million and an exchange rate of 104.32 Yen for each U.S. Dollar.",2023-12-30 16:56:34.873258
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on June 21, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor. Business Overview Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business, which represented 83% and 85% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are: •Cloud services and license support revenues, which include: olicense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and ocloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; generally have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time. •Cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise or other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above. Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services revenues represented 32%, 25% and 22% of our total revenues during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to: •expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and •continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services. Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods. Hardware Business Our hardware business, which represented 6% and 7% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners’ abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, with this factor becoming more pronounced in recent periods due to global supply chain constraints for certain technology components; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts; and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Services Business Our services business, which represented 11% and 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. We acquired certain companies and technologies during fiscal 2023 and 2022, including Cerner in fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our acquisition of Cerner and our other recent acquisitions. As compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: •Revenue Recognition; •Business Combinations; •Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; •Accounting for Income Taxes; and •Legal and Other Contingencies. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more discussion of our critical and other accounting policies. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the prior year. Revenue Recognition The most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606, Revenue Recognition from Customers, and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation. Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for each 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. We use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. For a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In such situations, we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable. We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Accounting for Income Taxes Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was impacted by our recent acquisitions, including Cerner. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, we have qualitatively disclosed the impact of our acquired products and services subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in operating segments’ revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we have also provided quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. The impacts of expense contributions from our recent acquisitions subsequent to the acquisition dates generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses. In addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below. Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2023 and 2022. During fiscal 2022, we remitted and recorded $4.7 billion for certain litigation related items that we do not expect to recur in future periods. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2022, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2023 and 2022, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.08 million in fiscal 2023 (using 1.08 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.07 million in fiscal 2022 (using 1.07 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2023 results using the fiscal 2022 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 Actual Constant 2022 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 31,226 32% 32% $ 23,679 EMEA(1) 12,109 1% 8% 12,011 Asia Pacific 6,619 -2% 8% 6,750 Total revenues 49,954 18% 22% 42,440 Total Operating Expenses 36,861 17% 19% 31,514 Total Operating Margin $ 13,093 20% 28% $ 10,926 Total Operating Margin % 26% 26% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 63% 56% EMEA 24% 28% Asia Pacific 13% 16% Total Revenues by Business: Cloud and license $ 41,086 14% 18% $ 36,052 Hardware 3,274 3% 6% 3,183 Services 5,594 75% 81% 3,205 Total revenues $ 49,954 18% 22% $ 42,440 % Revenues by Business: Cloud and license 83% 85% Hardware 6% 7% Services 11% 8% (1)Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased across our three businesses during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to revenue contributions from our acquisition of Cerner. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of Cerner, the constant currency revenues increase during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 in our cloud and license business was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and also renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services, partially offset by a decrease in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In our hardware business, the increase during fiscal 2023 was primarily due to growth in our Oracle Exadata and certain other strategic hardware product offerings. In our services business, the increase during fiscal 2023 was attributable to an increase in revenues for each of our primary services offerings. In reported currency, Cerner contributed $5.9 billion to our total revenues during fiscal 2023. In constant currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 84%, 10% and 6%, respectively, of the constant currency total revenue growth during fiscal 2023. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to additional operating expenses as a result of our acquisition of Cerner, including higher intangible assets amortization; higher cloud services and license support expenses, which were primarily due to higher employee related expenses and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; higher hardware expenses, which were primarily due to incremental hardware product costs related to Cerner’s hardware business; higher restructuring expenses; and higher expenses across other operating expense categories primarily due to higher employee related expenses. Furthermore, during fiscal 2022, we recorded gains of $250 million on operating asset sales, which was allocated as a benefit to most of our operating expense lines as presented per our consolidated statement of operations and which reduced our total operating expenses during the same period. These constant currency expense increases during fiscal 2023 were 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements partially offset by the absence of $4.7 billion of litigation related charges that were recorded to acquisition related and other expenses during fiscal 2022. We do not expect the litigation related charges to recur in future periods. In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2023, relative to fiscal 2022, primarily due to certain litigation related charges noted above that increased our operating expenses during fiscal 2022. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Amortization of intangible assets(1) $ 3,582 $ 1,150 Acquisition related and other(2) 190 4,713 Restructuring(3) 490 191 Stock-based compensation, operating segments(4) 1,201 735 Stock-based compensation, R&D and G&A(4) 2,346 1,878 Income tax effects(5) (2,136 ) (1,723 ) $ 5,673 $ 6,944 (1)Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2023, estimated future amortization related to intangible assets was as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2024 $ 2,994 Fiscal 2025 2,283 Fiscal 2026 1,620 Fiscal 2027 664 Fiscal 2028 635 Thereafter 1,641 Total intangible assets, net $ 9,837 (2)Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. For fiscal 2022, acquisition related and other expenses also included certain litigation related charges. We consider the litigation related charges that are included in this line item to be outside our ordinary course of business based on the following considerations: (i) the unprecedented nature of the litigation related charges including the nature and size of the damages awarded; (ii) the dissimilarity of this litigation and related charges to recurring litigation of which we are a party in our normal business course for which any and all such charges are included in our GAAP operating results and are not separately quantified and disclosed within this line item or any other line in the table presented above; (iii) the complexity of the case; (iv) the counterparty involved; and (v) our expectation that litigation related charges of this nature will not recur in future periods; among other factors. (3)Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2023 and 2022 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2022 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2022 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in management’s discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses,” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (4)Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2023 2022 Cloud services and license support $ 435 $ 205 Hardware 18 15 Services 137 67 Sales and marketing 611 448 Stock-based compensation, operating segments 1,201 735 Research and development 1,983 1,633 General and administrative 363 245 Total stock-based compensation $ 3,547 $ 2,613 (5)For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain acquisition related and other items, and after excluding the net deferred tax effects associated with a previously recorded income tax benefit that resulted from a partial 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements realignment of our legal entity structure resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.3%, instead of 6.8%, for fiscal 2023 and 16.3%, instead of 12.2%, for fiscal 2022, which in each case represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statement of operations. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: Oracle license support offerings; Oracle Cloud Services offerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 Actual Constant 2022 Cloud and License Revenues: Americas $ 25,821 25% 26% $ 20,594 EMEA 9,930 -1% 6% 10,016 Asia Pacific 5,335 -2% 8% 5,442 Total revenues 41,086 14% 18% 36,052 Expenses: Cloud services and license support(1) 7,222 47% 50% 4,915 Sales and marketing(1) 7,738 10% 13% 7,054 Total expenses(1) 14,960 25% 28% 11,969 Total Margin $ 26,126 8% 13% $ 24,083 Total Margin % 64% 67% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 63% 57% EMEA 24% 28% Asia Pacific 13% 15% Revenues by Offerings: Cloud services $ 15,881 47% 50% $ 10,809 License support 19,426 0% 4% 19,365 Cloud license and on-premise license 5,779 -2% 2% 5,878 Total revenues $ 41,086 14% 18% $ 36,052 Cloud Services and License Support Revenues by Ecosystem: Applications cloud services and license support $ 16,651 32% 35% $ 12,612 Infrastructure cloud services and license support 18,656 6% 10% 17,562 Total cloud services and license support revenues $ 35,307 17% 21% $ 30,174 (1)Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services for which we delivered such cloud and support services during the period presented, as well as revenue contributions from our Cerner acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in our non-Cerner cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In reported currency, Cerner contributed $3.6 billion to our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2023. In constant currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 84%, 9% and 7%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2023. In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to higher headcount; higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; and additional operating expenses due to our Cerner acquisition. In addition, an allocation of gains from operating asset sales in fiscal 2022 decreased our expenses during that period, with no comparable transaction in fiscal 2023. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods, and we expect this growth to continue during fiscal 2024 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to increases in total revenues for this business. Total margin as a percentage of revenues for this business decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to expenses growth. Hardware Business Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 Actual Constant 2022 Hardware Revenues: Americas $ 1,702 9% 10% $ 1,558 EMEA 933 -2% 3% 949 Asia Pacific 639 -5% 3% 676 Total revenues 3,274 3% 6% 3,183 Expenses: Hardware products and support(1) 1,011 7% 10% 944 Sales and marketing(1) 331 -8% -5% 361 Total expenses(1) 1,342 3% 6% 1,305 Total Margin $ 1,932 3% 6% $ 1,878 Total Margin % 59% 59% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 52% 49% EMEA 28% 30% Asia Pacific 20% 21% (1)Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above. The increase in our constant currency hardware revenues in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to revenue contributions from our Cerner acquisition and growth in our Oracle Exadata and certain other strategic hardware product offerings, relative to fiscal 2022. In reported currency, Cerner contributed $140 million to our hardware business’ revenues in fiscal 2023. Our hardware business’ revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal 2023 and 2022 due to the impacts of the global supply chain shortages for technology components that resulted in certain manufacturing delays. In constant currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 75%, 16% and 9%, respectively, to the revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2023. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to incremental hardware product costs from Cerner’s hardware business, partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses due to lower headcount. In constant currency, our hardware business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to higher total revenues for this business. In constant currency, total margin as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022. Services Business Our services offerings are designed to help maximize the performance of customer investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies and substantially include our consulting services and advanced customer services offerings. Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 Actual Constant 2022 Services Revenues: Americas $ 3,703 143% 143% $ 1,527 EMEA 1,246 19% 28% 1,046 Asia Pacific 645 2% 12% 632 Total revenues 5,594 75% 81% 3,205 Total Expenses(1) 4,490 77% 84% 2,539 Total Margin $ 1,104 66% 72% $ 666 Total Margin % 20% 21% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 66% 48% EMEA 22% 32% Asia Pacific 12% 20% (1)Excludes stock-based compensation and certain allocations. Also excludes certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 due to revenue contributions from our Cerner acquisition and revenue increases in each of our primary services offerings. In reported currency, Cerner contributed $2.2 billion to our services business’ revenues during fiscal 2023. In constant currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 86%, 11% and 3%, respectively, to the revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2023. In constant currency, total services expenses increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to additional operating expenses due to our acquisition of Cerner and other higher employee related expenses due to higher headcount. In constant currency, our services business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 due to higher total revenues for this business. In constant currency, total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 due to expenses growth. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

In addition, an allocation of gains from operating asset sales during fiscal 2022 decreased our expenses during that period, with no comparable transaction in fiscal 2023. Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization.

Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments, including adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.

Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs, contract termination costs and certain other exit costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 Actual Constant 2022 Restructuring expenses $ 490 157% 151% $ 191 Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2023 and 2022 primarily related to our 2022 Restructuring Plan. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2022 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans. The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2022 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing, selling and delivering our cloud-based offerings. Certain of the cost savings realized pursuant to our 2022 Restructuring Plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that better address the development, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud-based offerings, including investments in the development and delivery of our second-generation cloud infrastructure. Interest Expense: Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 Actual Constant 2022 Interest expense $ 3,505 27% 27% $ 2,755 Interest expense increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher average borrowings during fiscal 2023 resulting from borrowings pursuant to a $15.7 billion delayed draw term loan credit agreement (Bridge Credit Agreement), a $5.6 billion term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement), the issuance of $12.3 billion of senior notes and, to a lesser extent, issuances of commercial paper notes. The amount of indebtedness under the Bridge Credit Agreement was fully repaid from the proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and most of the proceeds from the issuance of $12.3 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2023. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest expense that resulted from $8.3 billion and $3.8 billion of scheduled repayments made during fiscal 2022 and 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. Non-Operating Expenses, net: Non-operating expenses, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan), net losses related to equity investments including losses attributable to equity method investments and net other income and expenses, including net unrealized gains and losses from our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, and non-service net periodic pension income and losses. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 Actual Constant 2022 Interest income $ 285 204% 214% $ 94 Foreign currency losses, net (249 ) 25% 27% (199 ) Noncontrolling interests in income (165 ) -11% -11% (184 ) Losses from equity investments, net (327 ) 122% 123% (147 ) Other losses, net (6 ) -92% -92% (86 ) Total non-operating expenses, net $ (462 ) -12% -12% $ (522 ) Our non-operating expenses, net decreased during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher interest income due to higher average interest rates that were applicable to our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances; and lower other losses, net, which was primarily attributable to higher unrealized investment gain associated with certain marketable equity securities that we held for employee benefit plans, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period. These decreases were partially offset by higher net losses associated with equity investments and higher foreign currency losses. Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 Actual Constant 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 623 -33% -26% $ 932 Effective tax rate 6.8% 12.2% Provision for income taxes decreased during fiscal 2023, relative to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to decreases attributable to a combination of the net excess benefit of amortization of Cerner intangible assets, a favorable mix of earnings when compared to fiscal 2022, and, to a lesser extent, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, which together were partially offset by the net tax impact of the absence of certain litigation related charges we incurred in fiscal 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Working capital $ (2,086 ) * $ 12,122 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 10,187 -53% $ 21,902 * Not meaningful 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2023 in comparison to May 31, 2022 was primarily due to $27.8 billion net cash used for our acquisition of Cerner, $1.6 billion of repayment of senior notes assumed from our acquisition of Cerner, $3.5 billion of long-term senior notes that were reclassified to current liabilities, cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2023. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by cash proceeds from borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the issuance of senior notes (refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from net income and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain other securities. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2023 in comparison to May 31, 2022 was primarily due to the net cash outflows of $27.8 billion for our acquisition of Cerner, $1.6 billion of repayment of senior notes assumed from our acquisition of Cerner, $3.8 billion of repayment of senior notes due October 2022 and February 2023, repurchases of our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. These cash outflows during fiscal 2023 were partially offset by certain cash inflows, primarily due to cash inflows generated by borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper notes, as well as cash inflows from our operations and stock option exercises during fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2023, we also borrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement which was fully repaid within the same period. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 17,165 80% $ 9,539 Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities $ (36,484 ) * $ 11,220 Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 7,910 * $ (29,126 ) * Not meaningful Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher net income that was primarily due to the absence of certain litigation related charges recorded during fiscal 2022 that we generally do not expect to recur and certain cash favorable working capital changes, net in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash used for investing activities was $36.5 billion during fiscal 2023 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $11.2 billion during fiscal 2022. The increase in net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the cash used for our acquisition of Cerner, an increase in cash used for capital expenditures and a decrease in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and other investments, partially offset by a decrease in cash used for the purchases of marketable securities and other investments, in each case relative to fiscal 2022. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Net cash provided by financing activities was $7.9 billion during fiscal 2023 compared to the net cash used for financing activities of $29.1 billion in fiscal 2022. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net cash proceeds from borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper notes, net of repayments; lower stock repurchases; lower maturities of senior notes and higher net cash from our employee stock program, in each case during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, we also borrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement which was fully repaid within the same period. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 17,165 80% $ 9,539 Capital expenditures (8,695 ) 93% (4,511 ) Free cash flow $ 8,470 68% $ 5,028 Net income $ 8,503 $ 6,717 Net cash provided by operating activities as a percent of net income 202% 142% Free cash flow as a percent of net income 100% 75% Recent Financing Activities: Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2023, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.36 per share that totaled $3.7 billion. In June 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 26, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 12, 2023. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Credit Agreements and Related Borrowings: On June 8, 2022, we borrowed $15.7 billion under the Bridge Credit Agreement to partly finance our acquisition of Cerner. We fully repaid the amount borrowed under the Bridge Credit Agreement during fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2023, we entered into and subsequently expanded the Term Loan Credit Agreement and borrowed a total of $4.7 billion under the first facility (Term Loan 1 Facility) and $960 million under the second facility (Term Loan 2 Facility and, together with the Term Loan 1 Facility, the Term Loan Facilities). We used the net proceeds of these borrowings to reduce the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Credit Agreement. We will begin making quarterly repayments of amounts borrowed under both Term Loan Facilities in September 2024. Any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan 1 Facility will be fully due and payable on August 16, 2027, and any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan 2 Facility will be fully due and payable on August 16, 2025, unless the termination date of one or both of the Term Loan Facilities is extended. Senior Notes: During fiscal 2023, we issued $12.3 billion of senior notes comprised of the following: •$1.0 billion of 5.80% senior notes due November 2025; •$750 million of 4.50% senior notes due May 2028; •$1.25 billion of 6.15% senior notes due November 2029; 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements •$750 million of 4.65% senior notes due May 2030; •$2.25 billion of 6.25% senior notes due November 2032; •$1.5 billion of 4.90% senior notes due February 2033; •$2.5 billion of 6.90% senior notes due November 2052; and •$2.25 billion of 5.55% senior notes due February 2053. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes to repay the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Credit Agreement, to repay $1.3 billion of senior notes due February 2023 and to partially repay our outstanding commercial paper notes. Cerner Senior Notes and Other Borrowings: We assumed $1.6 billion of senior notes and other borrowings through our Cerner acquisition, all of which were repaid during fiscal 2023. Commercial Paper Program: During fiscal 2023, our commercial paper program was increased to $6.0 billion. Our commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws. There were $563 million of outstanding commercial paper notes as of May 31, 2023 (none outstanding as of May 31, 2022) that mature at various dates through June 2023. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes. Additional details regarding these activities above are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May 31, 2023, approximately $8.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 17.0 million shares for $1.3 billion, 185.8 million shares for $16.2 billion, and 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Contractual Obligations: Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2023 consisted of: •principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments; •routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; •operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; and •other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. In addition, as of May 31, 2023, we had $9.4 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2024. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. Notes 2, 7, 13 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, and our $6.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital, 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2020 has been an annualized rate of 1.8% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2023, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2023, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 8.0%. During fiscal 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2023 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee. Stock-based awards activity from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2023 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2020 277 Stock-based awards granted and assumed 200 Stock-based awards vested and issued and, if applicable, exercised (212 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (49 ) Stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2023 216 Annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 51 Annualized stock repurchases (177 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2023 2,713 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2023 2,780 Stock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2023 8.0% Total in the money stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2023) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2023 8.0% Annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2023 1.8% Annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2023 -4.5% Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Equity Price Risk Marketable and Non-Marketable Equity Investments Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities investments totaled $972 million and $1.1 billion as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our marketable equity securities investments in publicly traded companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. Our non-marketable equity securities investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment. Our non-marketable equity securities investments accounted for under the equity method, primarily in a related party entity, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these equity method investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover. The timing and amounts of changes in fair value of our marketable and non-marketable equity investments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies in which we invest. Our non-marketable convertible debt investments would be subject to equity price risk in the future when the convertible option is exercised. For additional disclosure regarding the impact to our quarterly results of operations from investment volatility, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Translation Risk As described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables, total revenues and total expenses that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions. Our principal currency exposures include the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, Japanese Yen and Saudi Riyal. We have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for trading purposes. Realized gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, and also costs incurred to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts are included in non-operating expenses or income, net in our consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sensitivity Analysis The following table sets forth the hypothetical potential losses that we consider to be the most material to the reported fair values and/or future earnings of our equity investments and foreign currency influenced holdings, prior to any income tax effects, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates as of or for the reporting periods below: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) Hypothetical Change Impact 2023 2022 Equity price risk: Marketable and non-marketable equity investments 25% decrease in market price and fair values Earnings $ (243 ) $ (277 ) Foreign currency risk: Total revenues 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates Earnings $ (2,037 ) $ (2,107 ) Cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables, net 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates Fair values $ (1,407 ) $ (1,131 )",2023-12-30 16:56:31.115595
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. Business Overview We are the world’s largest enterprise software company. We are organized into two businesses, software and services, which are further divided into five operating segments. Each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in United States dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than United States dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our five operating segments follows. Software Business Our software business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software license revenues and (2) software license updates and product support revenues. We expect that our software business revenues will continue to increase, which should allow us to improve margins and profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software Licenses: We license our database, middleware and applications software to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. The growth in new software license revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software products and acquisitions. The new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period provides more visibility into the underlying fundamental performance of our software revenues than analysis of quarterly revenues. New software license margins have been affected by amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Competition in the software business is intense. Our goal is to maintain a first or second position in each of our software product categories and certain industry segments as well as to grow our software revenues faster than our competitors. We believe that the features and functionality of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. We have focused on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products by improving integration, decreasing installation times, lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use. Reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides our customers with a higher return on their investment, which we believe will create more demand and provide us with a competitive advantage. We have also continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our software products and service levels. We believe this will lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve our goal of becoming our customers’ leading technology advisor. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually, thereby eliminating the need to repurchase new software licenses when new upgrades are released. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is influenced by four factors: (1) the support contract base of companies acquired (2) the renewal rate of the support contract base, (3) the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (4) inflationary support price increases. 22 Table of Contents Software license updates and product support revenues, which represent approximately 46% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, is our highest margin business unit. Support margins over the last trailing 4-quarters were 89%, and account for 74% of our total margins over the same respective period. We believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will continue to grow for the following reasons: • Acquisitions over the past two years have significantly increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed. • Substantially all customers purchase license updates and product support subscriptions when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our support subscription contract base. Even if license revenue growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow assuming renewal and cancellation rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions add to the support contract base. • Substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal. • When support contract renewals are negotiated, inflationary price increases are assessed, where applicable. We record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business acquisitions to their estimated fair value at the acquisition dates. As a result, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amount of $391 million and $320 million that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. To the extent underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, On Demand and education revenues. Our services business, which represents 20% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, has significantly lower margins than our software business. Consulting: Consulting revenues tend to lag software revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Consulting revenues have been negatively impacted in recent periods for the following reasons: • Continued attrition of personnel due to a demand for technical talent in certain markets, particularly in the United States. • A shift in the mix of resources to lower cost countries, which has resulted in a decrease in average billing rates. • Our decision to work more closely with partners who perform implementations of our software. Despite these trends, we expect consulting revenues to increase in fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in application implementations related to acquired products and the addition of personnel acquired from Siebel. On Demand: On Demand includes our Oracle On Demand ‘software as a service’ and outsourcing offerings as well as Advanced Customer Services. We believe that our On Demand offerings provide an additional opportunity for customers to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive advantage. We will continue to make investments in Oracle On Demand to support current and future revenue growth, which may negatively impact future On Demand margins. Education: The purpose of our education services is to further enhance the usability of our software products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow software revenues. Education revenues have been impacted by personnel reductions in our customers’ information technology departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions. Despite these trends, we expect education revenues to increase in fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in customer training on the use of our acquired application products. 23 Table of Contents Operating Margins We continually focus on improving our operating margins by providing our customers with superior products and services as well as improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs. As part of this effort, we continually evaluate our workforce and make adjustments where we deem appropriate. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure, but we believe that the fundamental shift towards globalization is crucial to maintaining a long-term competitive cost structure. Acquisitions An active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy. In the last two years, we have paid an aggregate of $19.5 billion for our acquisitions, which included the following: • In January 2006, we acquired Siebel, a provider of customer relationship management software for approximately $6.1 billion. We completed the substantial majority of our planned legal-entity mergers, information system conversions and integration of Siebel’s operations and expect to finalize all other planned integration activities in the next three months; • In January 2005, we acquired PeopleSoft, a provider of enterprise application software products for approximately $11.1 billion. We completed our planned legal-entity mergers, information system conversions and integration of PeopleSoft’s operations in the first half of fiscal 2006. We believe our recent acquisitions support our long-term strategic direction, strengthen our competitive position, particularly in the applications market, expand our customer base and provide greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation, increase stockholder value and grow our earnings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund additional acquisitions with our internally available cash and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our commercial paper program, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Business Combinations • PeopleSoft Customer Assurance Program • Goodwill • Revenue Recognition 24 Table of Contents • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation • Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Business Combinations In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based on their estimated fair values. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from license sales, maintenance agreements, consulting contracts, customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the acquired company’s brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In connection with purchase price allocations, we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with acquisitions. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation. As a result, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amount of $391 million and $320 million that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their contracts when the contract is eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Had we included our estimated selling and research and development activities, and the associated margin for unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided under our assumed support arrangements, the fair value of the support obligations would have been significantly higher than what we have recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount of software license updates and product support revenue historically and in future periods related to these assumed contracts. 25 Table of Contents Other significant estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs are primarily comprised of severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management but which are subject to refinement. To estimate restructuring expenses, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan. Decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with pre-merger activities of the companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period (generally within one year of the acquisition date) and as operating expenses thereafter. Changes in cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with our pre-merger activities are recorded in restructuring expenses. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies. If, during the purchase price allocation period, we are able to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation. If, as of the end of the purchase price allocation period, we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated. After the end of the purchase price allocation period, any adjustment that results from a pre-acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined. PeopleSoft Customer Assurance Program As discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2003, in response to our tender offer, PeopleSoft implemented what it referred to as the “customer assurance program” or “CAP.” The CAP incorporated a provision in PeopleSoft’s standard licensing arrangement that purports contractually to burden Oracle, as a result of our acquisition of PeopleSoft, with a contingent obligation to make payments to PeopleSoft customers should we fail to take certain business actions for a fixed period, which typically expires four years from the date of the contract. We have concluded that, as of the date of the acquisition, the penalty provisions under the CAP represent a contingent liability of Oracle. We have not recorded a liability related to the CAP, as we do not believe it is probable that our post-acquisition activities related to the PeopleSoft and JD Edwards product lines will trigger an obligation to make any payment pursuant to the CAP. The maximum potential penalty under the CAP as of May 31, 2006 was $3.5 billion. Unless the CAP provisions are removed from these licensing arrangements, we do not expect the aggregate potential CAP obligation to decline substantially until fiscal year 2008 when these provisions begin to expire. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of potential litigation, we believe we would also have substantial defenses with respect to the legality and enforceability of the CAP contract provisions in response to any claims seeking payment from Oracle under the CAP terms. If we determine in the future that a payment pursuant to the CAP is probable, the estimated liability would be recorded in our operating results in the period in which such liability is determined. Goodwill We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The provisions of Statement 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. 26 Table of Contents Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, did not result in an impairment charge. Revenue Recognition We derive revenues from the following sources: (1) software, which includes new software license and software license updates and product support revenues, and (2) services, which include consulting, On Demand and education revenues. New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software, and exclude revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support. While the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of Statement of Position No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenue when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support, which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers purchase both software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in SOP 97-2. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. We recognize no more than 90% of the milestone or total contract amount until project acceptance is obtained. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized 27 Table of Contents when we receive final acceptance from the customer. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions, then new software license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees; (2) where services include significant modification or customization of the software; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. On Demand is comprised of Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer Services. Oracle On Demand provides multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database, middleware and applications software. Advanced Customer Services are earned by providing customers configuration and performance analysis, personalized support and annual on-site technical services. Revenues from On Demand services are recognized over the term of the service contract, which is generally one year. Education revenues include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by “vendor specific objective evidence.” Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and for software license updates and product support services, is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer. We may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results. We defer revenue for any undelivered elements, and recognize revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed, in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements, we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we provide for a sales return allowance in accordance with FASB Statement No. 48, Revenue Recognition when Right of Return Exists. If acceptance provisions are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement or if we cannot reasonably estimate the incidence of returns, revenue is recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. 28 Table of Contents We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software licenses and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of non-acceptance is remote, we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenue is recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30; however, terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to credit worthy customers through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. We account for the sale of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have licensed our software to these same companies (a “Concurrent Transaction”). Software license agreements that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any software license transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length, and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize new software license revenue from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we recognized new software license revenues of approximately $33 million from a supplier. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we negotiated to acquire goods and services from this supplier and finalized terms of the purchase. The value of the goods and services we will acquire from this supplier under this agreement will total approximately $20 million over the next five years. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 29 Table of Contents Remittances of foreign earnings to the U.S. are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the U.S. and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. As part of our accounting for business combinations, some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the quarter the impairment is recorded. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is generally not tax deductible; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expense as part of the purchase price allocation. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 30 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation Up until May 31, 2006, we measured compensation expense for our stock-based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under this method, we did not record compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure, we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock-based incentive programs. We were required to adopt the provisions of FASB Statement 123(R), Share-Based Payment, in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Although the adoption of Statement 123(R)’s fair value method has no adverse impact on our balance sheet or total cash flows, it affects our operating expenses, net income and earnings per share. The actual effects of adopting Statement 123(R) will depend on numerous factors including the amounts of share-based payments granted in the future, the valuation model we use to value future share-based payments to employees and estimated forfeiture rates. We estimate that stock-based compensation expense will reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.03 in fiscal 2007. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are recorded at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages, we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. We also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period the related revenues are recorded. These estimates are based on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations The fluctuations in operating results of Oracle in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 are generally due to acquisitions, principally our acquisition of PeopleSoft in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Siebel in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and Retek, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, we quantify the contribution of PeopleSoft, Siebel and Retek products to growth in new software license revenues, the amount of revenues associated with PeopleSoft and Siebel software license updates and product support and On Demand services and present supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting where applicable. Although certain revenues were quantifiable, we are unable to identify consulting and education revenues of Siebel in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as well as allocate costs associated with the PeopleSoft and Siebel products and services in fiscal 2006 because the substantial majority of former PeopleSoft and Siebel sales and services personnel were fully integrated into our existing operations. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends, the information has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • The quantification cannot address the substantial effects attributable to our sales force integration efforts, in particular the effect of having a single sales force offer the Oracle and PeopleSoft product families on a neutral basis and the integration of Siebel into our CRM sales force. The commissions earned by our integrated sales force in these integrations did not vary based on the application product family sold. We believe that if our sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of Oracle, PeopleSoft and Siebel products sold would have been different. • The acquisitions of PeopleSoft and Siebel did not result in our entering a new line of business or product category. Therefore, we provided multiple products with substantially similar features and functionality. • Although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their contracts when the contract is eligible for renewal, amounts shown as support deferred revenue in our supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation We compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and prior year results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect on May 31, 2005, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2005, our financial statements would reflect revenues of $1.27 million in fiscal 2006 (using 1.27 as the exchange rate) and $1.25 million in fiscal 2005 (using 1.25 as the exchange rate). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2006 results using the fiscal 2005 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the periods. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual results as reported and based on constant currency. 32 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2006 Actual Constant 2005 Actual Constant 2004 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 7,652 32% 31% $ 5,798 16% 16% $ 4,983 EMEA(1) 4,708 10% 15% 4,288 17% 9% 3,677 Asia Pacific 2,020 18% 21% 1,713 15% 10% 1,496 Total revenues 14,380 22% 23% 11,799 16% 12% 10,156 Total Operating Expenses 9,644 24% 25% 7,777 24% 20% 6,292 Total Operating Margin $ 4,736 18% 20% $ 4,022 4% -1% $ 3,864 Total Operating Margin % 33% 34% 38% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 53% 49% 49% EMEA 33% 36% 36% Asia Pacific 14% 15% 15% Total Revenues by Business: Software $ 11,541 23% 24% $ 9,421 17% 13% $ 8,070 Services 2,839 19% 21% 2,378 14% 10% 2,086 Total revenues $ 14,380 22% 23% $ 11,799 16% 12% $ 10,156 % Revenues by Business: Software 80% 80% 79% Services 20% 20% 21% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Total revenues increased in fiscal 2006 due to strong sales execution, incremental revenues from acquisitions and a strengthening in our competitive position. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues contributed 50% to the growth in total revenues, new software licenses contributed 32% and services revenues contributed 18%. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 22% and Asia Pacific contributed 13%. Total revenues in the Americas, specifically in the United States, increased at a faster rate than in other regions primarily due to the relative geographical mix of revenues from our acquired companies. Operating expenses were favorably affected by 1 percentage point as a result of the strengthening of the United States dollar relative to other major international currencies. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher headcount levels and associated personnel related costs in sales and marketing, consulting and research and development, higher commissions due to the increase in revenues and greater amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by lower restructuring and acquisition related expenses. Operating margins as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly due to higher costs associated with acquisitions, principally amortization of intangible assets. International operations will continue to provide a significant portion of total revenues. As a result, total revenues and expenses will be affected by changes in the relative strength of the United States dollar against certain major international currencies. 33 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total revenues reflects $685 million associated with PeopleSoft products and services as well as an increase in sales of our products and services resulting from improved sales execution as a result of product specialization, a strengthening in our competitive position and a stronger economy, particularly in the United States. Total revenues were favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations due to a weakening of the United States dollar against certain major international currencies, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 61% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 27% and Asia Pacific contributed 12%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total operating expenses increased 20%. Operating expenses were unfavorably affected as a result of the weakening of the United States dollar relative to other major international currencies. Operating margins as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 38% to 34%. The decline in operating margins is primarily due to costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of PeopleSoft such as amortization of intangible assets, acquisition related costs, restructuring costs and stock-based compensation resulting from the assumption of unvested PeopleSoft stock options. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Acquisition Accounting To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. Readers are directed to the introduction under “Results of Operations” for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. The results of operations include the following purchase accounting adjustments and significant expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Support deferred revenue(1) $ 391 $ 320 $ — Amortization of intangible assets(2) 583 219 36 Acquisition related charges(3) (5) 137 208 54 Restructuring(4) 85 147 — Stock-based compensation(5) 31 25 — Income tax effect(6) (362 ) (264 ) (29 ) $ 865 $ 655 $ 61 (1) In connection with our purchase price allocations, we estimated the fair value of support obligations assumed in connection with business acquisitions made during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amount of $391 and $320 that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities, were not recognized during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts assumed that will not be recognized due to the application of business combination accounting rules in future periods are as follows: Year Ended May 31, 2007 $ 137 2008 9 Total $ 146 To the extent customers renew these support contracts, we expect to recognize revenue for the full contract value over the support renewal period. 34 Table of Contents (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions, primarily PeopleSoft and Siebel. Estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is as follows: Year Ended May 31, 2007 $ 738 2008 727 2009 722 2010 615 2011 431 Thereafter 1,295 Total $ 4,528 (3) Acquisition related charges primarily consist of in-process research and development expenses, integration-related professional services, stock-based compensation expenses and personnel related costs for transitional employees, as well as costs associated with our tender offer for PeopleSoft prior to the agreement date. (4) Restructuring costs relate to Oracle employee severance and facility closures in connection with restructuring plans initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and 2005. (5) Stock-based compensation is included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended May 31, 2006 2005 2004 Sales and marketing $ 8 $ 6 $ — Software license updates and product support 3 2 — Cost of services 7 7 — Research and development 13 10 — Acquisition related charges 18 47 — Total $ 49 $ 72 $ — Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related charges resulted from unvested options assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was fully accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of these options. We adopted Statement 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Statement 123(R) requires us to record the fair value amortization of all stock-based compensation awards. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our adoption of Statement 123(R). (6) The income tax effect on purchase accounting adjustments and other significant expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions was calculated based on our effective tax rate of 29.7%, 28.8% and 32.0% in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 35 Table of Contents Software Software includes new software licenses and software license updates and product support.

Applications revenues contributed 60% to the increase in new software license revenues, database revenues contributed 26% and middleware revenues contributed 14% in fiscal 2006. Additionally, new software license revenues increased in all geographic regions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 57%, EMEA contributed 23% and Asia Pacific contributed 20% to the increase in new software license revenues. New software license revenues in the Americas, specifically in the United States, increased at a faster rate than in other regions primarily due to the relative geographical mix of revenues and location of sales personnel from our acquired companies. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, database and middleware revenues grew 11%. Database revenues increased 8% primarily driven by increased demand for database option products. Middleware revenues grew 36% due to a gain in market share in the application server market as a result of better sales execution and more competitive features and functionality. Middleware revenues also include $34 million of revenues from the licensing of Siebel products in fiscal 2006. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, applications revenue increased 67% as a result of increased demand for our applications products, including products from acquired companies, better sales execution as a result of segmenting our sales force by product and a strengthening of our competitive position in the applications market, particularly in the United States and EMEA. PeopleSoft products contributed $220 million to the growth in applications revenue in fiscal 2006, Oracle products contributed $154 million, Siebel products contributed $103 million and Retek products contributed $41 million. New software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million increased from 40% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2005 to 45% in fiscal 2006. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and marketing expenses increased due to higher commission expenses resulting from the growth in new software license revenues, higher personnel related expenditures primarily associated with our expanded sales force from acquired companies and higher advertising expenses. The total new software license margin as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to incremental amortization of intangible assets and higher compensation expenses. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license revenues increased due to improved sales execution, a strengthening in our competitive position, a stronger economy, particularly in the United States, and revenues from the licensing of PeopleSoft products of $126 million. The increase in database and middleware new software license revenues was driven by a 23% increase in application server revenues and a 12% increase in database revenues. The increase in applications new software license revenues was primarily due to revenues from the licensing of PeopleSoft products, improved sales execution as a result of product specialization and increased demand for our products, particularly in North America. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 71%, EMEA contributed 12% and Asia Pacific contributed 17% to the increase in new software license revenues. New software license revenues earned from large transactions, defined as new software license transactions over $0.5 million, increased from 37% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2004 to 40% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2005. Sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to higher commission expenses that resulted from higher revenue levels, as well as higher personnel related costs associated with increased sales headcount. The total new software license margin as a percentage of revenues was negatively affected as a result of higher personnel related expenditures and amortization of intangible assets. 37 Table of Contents Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. The cost of providing support services consists largely of personnel related expenses.

Software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2006 include incremental revenues of $797 million from PeopleSoft contracts and $90 million from Siebel contracts. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 72% to the growth in software license updates and product support revenues, EMEA contributed 20% and Asia Pacific contributed 8%. Software license updates and product support revenues in the Americas, specifically in the United States, increased at a faster rate than in other regions primarily due to the relative geographical mix of revenues and existing support contract bases of our acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed to their estimated fair value at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $391 million and $320 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when the contract is eligible for 38 Table of Contents renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Software license updates and product support expenses increased primarily due to higher salary and benefits associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer base and higher bonuses as a result of increased revenue levels. The software license updates and product support margin as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to incremental amortization of intangible assets. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased as a result of the renewal of a substantial majority of the subscription base eligible for renewal, the addition of software license updates and product support revenues associated with new software license revenues recognized in fiscal 2005, more timely contract renewals, as well as $258 million in revenues from the expansion of our customer base resulting from the acquisition of PeopleSoft. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 53% to the growth in software license updates and product support revenues, EMEA contributed 32% and Asia Pacific contributed 15%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support expenses increased primarily due to higher personnel costs associated with increased headcount, higher discretionary bonuses and facility expenses. The total software license updates and product support margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets. Services Services consist of consulting, On Demand and education.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 56% to the growth in consulting revenues, EMEA contributed 26% and Asia Pacific contributed 18%. Consulting expenses increased as a result of higher salary and benefit expenses due to additional resources acquired from acquisitions and increased external contractor costs due to employee attrition. The total consulting margin as a percentage of revenues was negatively affected as a result of additional consulting expenses attributed to headcount levels and external contractor related expenditures. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Consulting revenues increased $258 million due to revenues earned by performing services under PeopleSoft consulting contracts, partially offset by a decline in consulting revenues earned from services rendered under Oracle consulting contracts. The decline in revenue from Oracle consulting contracts is due to a shift in the mix of resources to lower cost countries, which has resulted in a decrease in billing rates. Consulting revenues also declined as a result of our decision to work more closely with partners, who are performing a higher percentage of the implementations of our software. Excluding PeopleSoft related revenues, consulting revenues decreased in the United States due to higher attrition rates which resulted in a decline in billable hours and revenues. The decline in Asia Pacific consulting revenues was primarily due to a large consulting project in Japan, which was substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2004. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting expenses increased 11% primarily due to higher external contractor costs and personnel related expenditures due to higher headcount and revenue levels. The total consulting margin as a percentage of revenues was negatively affected as a result of additional consulting expenses attributed to higher personnel related costs associated with increased headcount. On Demand: On Demand includes Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer Services. Oracle On Demand provides multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database, middleware and applications software.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65% to the increase in On Demand revenues, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 5%. On Demand expenses increased due to higher personnel related expenditures in both our Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer Services businesses as a result of additional resources acquired from Siebel as well as higher computer and technology related charges and external contractor costs in our Oracle On Demand business. The total On Demand margin as a percentage of revenues declined due to lower margins associated with the Siebel On Demand offering as well as additional expenditures incurred to support planned future growth. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, On Demand services revenues increased primarily due to the expansion of our subscription base in Oracle On Demand services. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 72% to the increase in On Demand services revenues, EMEA contributed 12% and Asia Pacific contributed 16%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total On Demand expenses increased 14% primarily due to higher employee related expenditures related to increased headcount.

The increase in database and middleware headcount was primarily due to hiring of resources outside the United States, while the increase in applications headcount was primarily due to Siebel resources acquired. Research and development expenses increased due to incremental salary and benefits for the additional headcount, higher discretionary bonus expenditures and higher facility and technology costs, partially offset by lower external contractor costs. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2005 due to higher external contractor costs, as well as higher personnel and related expenditures related to the increase in headcount.

Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Amortization of intangible assets increased due to amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the PeopleSoft acquisition. Acquisition Related Charges: Acquisition related charges primarily consist of in-process research and development expenses, integration-related professional services, stock-compensation expenses and personnel related costs for transitional employees. Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related charges relates to unvested options assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was fully accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of these options.

In addition, professional fees, which primarily relates to tender offer costs for PeopleSoft prior to the agreement date, increased in fiscal 2005. Restructuring: Restructuring expenses consist of Oracle employee severance costs and Oracle duplicate facilities closures which were initiated to improve our cost structure as a result of acquisitions. For additional information regarding the Oracle restructuring plans, as well as restructuring activities of our acquired companies, please see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additionally, the restructuring program in fiscal 2005 included $21 million of facility exit and termination costs. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Restructuring expenses increased in fiscal 2005 due to Oracle employee severance and facility closures associated with plans initiated in the third quarter of 2005. No restructuring plans were initiated in fiscal 2004.

We expect interest expense to increase in fiscal 2007, which will reflect a full year of interest on the $5.75 billion senior notes. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to borrowings in December 2004 of $9.2 billion under a $9.5 billion unsecured term loan agreement, which we repaid in various installments from February 2005 through May 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we borrowed $2.0 billion under a commercial paper program and $700 million under a 364-day unsecured loan facility that are outstanding at May 31, 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2004 included $5.5 million in commitment fees related to an unused $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that expired in December 2004 and additional interest associated with our $150 million senior notes that matured in February 2004. 44 Table of Contents Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net investment gains related to marketable equity securities and other investments, equity in earnings of i-flex solutions limited and the minority interest share in the net profits of Oracle Japan.

Interest income decreased slightly due to lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased from 1.9% in fiscal 2005 to 3.0% in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Non-operating income, net increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to higher interest income earned resulting from higher average cash balances and slightly higher interest rates available in the capital markets. In fiscal 2005, the weighted average interest rate earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased from 1.5% to 1.9%. Provision for Income Taxes: The effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Provision for income taxes $ 1,429 23% $ 1,165 -8% $ 1,264 Effective tax rate 29.7% 28.8% 32.0% Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2006 due to higher earnings before tax and a higher effective tax rate. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 is primarily attributable to a higher percentage of earnings in high tax jurisdictions as compared with other lower tax rate jurisdictions. In addition, we did not benefit from certain non-recurring tax events in fiscal 2006 that occurred in fiscal 2005, as described below, and we incurred higher non-deductible in-process research and development charges in fiscal 2006. 45 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Provision for income taxes decreased due to a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher earnings before tax. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to higher earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions. In addition, the fiscal 2005 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by 4.2% due to the settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitation on assessments and the true-up of estimated tax accruals upon filing of prior year tax returns. Partially reducing this benefit was an increase to our effective tax rate of 3.6% in fiscal 2005 for the dividend pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 as well as acquisition and restructuring costs related to non-deductible expenses resulting from in-process research and development charges and additional taxes associated with tender offer costs incurred from June 9, 2003 to December 12, 2004 for PeopleSoft that, upon acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, had to be capitalized into the basis of the stock for tax purposes. We provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2006, the cumulative earnings upon which United States income taxes have not been provided for were approximately $3.0 billion. If these earnings were repatriated in the United States, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability for these earnings would be approximately $550 million. In fiscal 2005, we repatriated $3.1 billion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded a federal tax expense of $118 million and a state tax expense (net of federal tax benefit) of $3 million. We repatriated the maximum amount available for repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings does not change our position going forward that future earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested. Liquidity and Capital Resources May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Working capital $ 5,044 1,210% $ 385 -95% $ 7,064 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 7,605 59% $ 4,771 -44% $ 8,587 Working capital: The increase in working capital in fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the $5.75 billion long-term senior notes issued in January 2006 as well as greater cash flows from operations from higher sales volumes, partially offset by cash used to pay for acquisitions and to reduce other debt obligations. The decline in working capital in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to cash paid to acquire PeopleSoft and an increase in short-term borrowings. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments in time deposits held at major banks, commercial paper, United States government agency discount notes, money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, corporate notes and Unites States government agency notes. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities include $3.1 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2006. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is due to the $5.75 billion senior notes issued in January 2006, cash flows from operations from higher sales volumes and the collection of trade receivables, partially offset by cash used to pay for acquisitions, repurchase common stock and to reduce other debt obligations. Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 55 at May 31, 2006 compared with 56 days at May 31, 2005. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the adjustment to reduce software license updates and product support revenue related to adjusting the carrying value for deferred support revenues acquired to its estimated fair value. The decline in days sales outstanding is due to more timely collections as well as a shift in the mix of total revenues. Software 46 Table of Contents license updates and product support revenues are generally billed one year in advance, while the revenues are recognized ratably over the annual contract period. Software license updates and product support revenues as a percent of total revenues increased, resulting in higher cash collections and lower days sales outstanding. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Cash provided by operating activities $ 4,541 28% $ 3,552 11% $ 3,195 Cash used for investing activities $ (3,359 ) -42% $ (5,753 ) 126% $ (2,548 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 1,527 -19% $ 1,884 243% $ (1,320 ) Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for software license updates and product support are generally received by the beginning of the contract term, which is generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software license sales and, to a lesser extent, services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures, payment of taxes, facilities and technology costs. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Cash flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher net income, excluding non-cash charges, partially offset by increased accounts receivables due to fourth quarter fiscal 2006 revenue growth. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to higher net income, excluding non-cash charges, and increases in non-acquisition related deferred revenues, partially offset by the payment of liabilities assumed in connection with the PeopleSoft acquisition. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired as well as proceeds from property sales. Investing cash outflows in fiscal 2005 include cash paid for our acquisition of PeopleSoft, whereas investing cash outflows in fiscal 2006 primarily relates to our acquisition of Siebel Systems and our equity investment purchases in i-flex. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: Cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to cash paid to acquire PeopleSoft. The increase was partially offset by higher proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt obligations as well as stock repurchase activity. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005: Cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher stock repurchases, partially offset by higher net borrowings. We increased our share repurchases in fiscal 2006 due to the issuance of approximately 141 million shares of common stock in connection with our Siebel acquisition. We intend to continue to repurchase shares under our stock repurchase programs. 47 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004: We generated cash flow from financing activities in fiscal 2005 as a result of net borrowings of $2.7 billion primarily used to pay for the acquisition of PeopleSoft. In the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we borrowed $9.2 billion under a bridge loan to fund the acquisition of PeopleSoft and repaid the entire balance as of May 31, 2005 with cash flows from operations, proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities, the repatriation of foreign earnings and new borrowings. We borrowed $2.0 billion under a $3.0 billion commercial paper program and $700 million under a 364-day loan facility through a wholly-owned subsidiary in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flow generated from operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Cash provided by operating activities $ 4,541 28% $ 3,552 11% $ 3,195 Capital expenditures(1) $ (236 ) 26% $ (188 ) -1% $ (189 ) Free cash flow $ 4,305 28% $ 3,364 12% $ 3,006 Net income $ 3,381 17% $ 2,886 8% $ 2,681 Free cash flow as a percent of net income 127% 117% 112% (1) Represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Long-Term Customer Financing We offer our customers the option to acquire our software and services through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell such contracts on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, $618 million, $456 million and $357 million or approximately 13%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of our new software license revenues were financed through our financing division. 48 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2006: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Principal payments on short-term borrowings and long-term debt(1) $ 5,906 $ 156 $ — $ 1,500 $ — $ 2,250 $ 2,000 Capital leases(2) 7 3 4 — — — — Interest payments on short-term borrowings and long-term debt(1) 1,838 305 297 277 217 217 525 Operating leases(3) 1,416 414 227 195 157 117 306 Purchase obligations(4) 329 111 217 1 Funding commitments(5) 6 6 — — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 9,502 $ 995 $ 745 $ 1,973 $ 374 $ 2,584 $ 2,831 (1) Short-term borrowings and long-term debt consists of the following as of May 31, 2006: Principal Balance Floating rate senior notes due January 2009 (effective interest rate of 5.28%) $ 1,500 5.00% senior notes due January 2011, net of discount of $8 2,242 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $11 1,989 6.91% senior notes due February 2007 (effective interest rate of 7.30%) 150 Other 6 Total $ 5,887 Interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreements and include estimates based on the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2006 for variable rate borrowings and borrowings for which we have entered into interest-rate swap agreements. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our borrowings. (2) Represents remaining payments under capital leases of computer equipment assumed from acquisitions. (3) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $559 in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2006. (4) Represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. (5) Represents the maximum additional capital we may need to contribute toward our venture fund investments which are payable upon demand. We acquired two companies in June 2006 and completed our acquisition of Portal Software, Inc. on July 3, 2006 for approximately $340 million in cash and approximately 2.5 million options assumed. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions have not yet been completed. 49 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Recent Financing Activities In January 2006, we issued $1.5 billion of floating rate senior notes due 2009, $2.25 billion of 5.00% senior notes due 2011 and $2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due 2016 (collectively, original senior notes) to finance the Siebel acquisition and for general corporate purposes. On June 16, 2006, we completed a registered exchange offer for the original senior notes to permit holders to freely transfer their senior notes, which have substantially identical terms to the original senior notes. The 2009 notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.23% per year, the 2011 notes bear interest at the rate of 5.00% per year, and the 2016 notes bear interest at the rate of 5.25% per year. Interest is payable quarterly for the 2009 notes and semi-annually for the 2011 notes and 2016 notes. The effective interest yield of the 2009 notes, 2011 notes and 2016 notes at May 31, 2006 was 5.28%, 5.09% and 5.33%, respectively. We may redeem the 2009 notes after January 2007 and may redeem the 2011 notes and 2016 notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In February 2006, we entered into dealer agreements with various financial institutions and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, relating to a new $3.0 billion commercial paper program (the New CP Program). We did not have any outstanding borrowings under the New CP Program at May 31, 2006. In March 2006, we entered into a new $3.0 billion, 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (New Credit Agreement) with Wachovia Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders. The New Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility which can be used to backstop any commercial paper that we may issue and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and investment needs. In addition, we believe we could fund other acquisitions and repurchase common stock with our internally available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our credit facilities, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Quarterly Results of Operations Quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales compensation plans. These seasonal factors are common in the software industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically, has been the highest quarter. We expect this trend to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. 50 Table of Contents The following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2006 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 2,768 $ 3,292 $ 3,470 $ 4,851 Gross profit $ 1,311 $ 1,705 $ 1,779 $ 2,606 Operating income $ 712 $ 1,116 $ 1,052 $ 1,857 Net income $ 519 $ 798 $ 765 $ 1,300 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.10 $ 0.15 $ 0.15 $ 0.25 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.10 $ 0.15 $ 0.14 $ 0.24 Fiscal 2005 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 2,215 $ 2,756 $ 2,950 $ 3,878 Gross profit $ 1,180 $ 1,611 $ 1,493 $ 2,165 Operating income $ 715 $ 1,131 $ 770 $ 1,407 Net income $ 509 $ 815 $ 540 $ 1,022 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.10 $ 0.16 $ 0.11 $ 0.20 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.10 $ 0.16 $ 0.10 $ 0.20 Stock Options Our stock option program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution for each of the last three full fiscal years has been less than 2.0% and has averaged 1.4% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for the year, net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised. Many of these options, which have 10-year exercise periods, have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price. At May 31, 2006, 25% of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. Consistent with our historic practices, we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed 1.5% per year for our ongoing business. Over the last 10 years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions or to repay indebtedness. At May 31, 2006, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised option awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 9.1%. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 25,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants up to 25,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. 51 Table of Contents Options granted from June 1, 2003 through May 31, 2006 are summarized as follows: (Shares in millions) Options outstanding at May 31, 2003 455 Options granted(1) 333 Options exercised (196 ) Forfeitures (119 ) Options outstanding at May 31, 2006 473 Average annualized options granted, net of forfeitures 71 Average annualized stock repurchases 126 Shares outstanding at May 31, 2006 5,232 Weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2003 through May 31, 2006 5,182 Options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2006 9.0% In the money options outstanding (based on our May 31, 2006 stock price) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2006 6.8% Average annualized options granted, net of forfeitures and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2003 through May 31, 2006 1.4% Average annualized options granted, net of forfeitures and after stock repurchases, as a percent of average shares outstanding from June 1, 2003 through May 31, 2006 -1.1% (1) Includes 179 million options assumed in connection with acquisitions. Generally, we grant stock options to key employees on an annual basis. During fiscal 2006, we made our annual grant of options and other grants to purchase approximately 67.6 million shares, which were partially offset by forfeitures of options to purchase 58.1 million shares. New Accounting Pronouncements Share-Based Payment: On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Statement 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123(R) generally requires share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition is no longer an alternative. On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the Statement 123(R) effective transition date would be extended to annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of Statement 123(R) under the modified prospective method in our first quarter of fiscal 2007. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date of adoption (a) based on the requirements of Statement 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date of adoption and (b) based on the requirements of Statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of adoption that remain unvested on the date of adoption. Statement 123(R) also requires a portion of the benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules. 52 Table of Contents As permitted by Statement 123, we accounted for share-based payments to employees using Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method up to May 31, 2006. Although the adoption of Statement 123(R)’s fair value method will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet or total cash flows, it will affect our net income and earnings per share. The actual effects of adopting Statement 123(R) will depend on numerous factors including the amounts of share-based payments granted in the future, the valuation model we use to value future share-based payments to employees and estimated forfeiture rates. We estimate that stock-based compensation expense will reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.03 in fiscal 2007 as a result of the adoption of Statement 123(R). Accounting Changes and Error Corrections: On June 7, 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. Statement 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change. Statement 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. Statement 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, the Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. We do not believe adoption of Statement 154 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Interpretation 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements in accordance with Statement 109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additionally, Interpretation 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Interpretation 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of Interpretation 48 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Income Rate Risk. Based on our intentions regarding our investments, we classify our investments as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity investments are reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are reported at market value. Auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are reported on the balance sheet at par value, which equals market value, as the rate on such securities re-sets generally every 7 to 28 days. As a majority of our investments are held-to-maturity, interest rate movements do not affect the balance sheet valuation of the fixed income investments. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our investments. For fiscal 2006, total interest income was $170 million with investments yielding an average 3.04% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was up approximately 111 basis points from 1.93% for fiscal 2005. If overall interest rates fell by a similar amount (111 basis points) in fiscal 2007, our interest income would decline approximately $64 million, assuming consistent investment levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2006. The cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances approximate fair value at May 31, 2006: (Dollars in millions) AmortizedPrincipal Amount Weighted AverageInterest Rate Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,659 4.08% Marketable securities 946 2.18% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 7,605 3.84% 53 Table of Contents The following table includes the United States dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies. See discussion of our foreign currency risk below for a description of how we hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure.

Borrowings as of May 31, 2006 were $5.9 billion, consisting of $4.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $1.6 billion of variable rate borrowings. Interest expense for fiscal 2006 was $169 million. Based on effective interest rates at May 31, 2006, a 50 basis point increase in interest rates on our borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest expense by approximately $8 million annually.

(2) We entered into an interest-rate swap agreement that has the economic effect of modifying the interest obligations associated with our 6.91% senior notes so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively becomes variable based on the three month LIBOR set quarterly until maturity. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts, to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of 90 days or less. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts (excluding our Yen equity hedge described below) are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in non-operating income, net. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature. Net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $15 million, $(27) million and $(21) million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts were not significant individually and approximated $(0.3) million and $0.2 million as of May 31, 2006 and 2005. 54 Table of Contents The table below presents the notional amounts (at contract exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates for the outstanding forward contracts as of May 31, 2006. Notional weighted average exchange rates are quoted using market conventions where the currency is expressed in currency units per United States dollar. All of our forward contracts mature in 90 days or less as of May 31, 2006.

Periodically, we hedge the net assets of certain international subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the effectiveness of net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders’ equity to offset the translation results on the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion) is recognized in non-operating income, net. At May 31, 2006, we had one net investment hedge in Japanese Yen. The Yen investment hedge minimizes currency risk arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary offering of Oracle Japan. The fair value of our Yen investment hedge was nominal as of May 31, 2006 and 2005. The Yen investment hedge has a notional amount of $595 million and an exchange rate of 111 Yen per United States dollar. Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in stockholders’ equity were $23 million, $(23) million and $(38) million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net gains on investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were $24 million, $14 million and $8 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.",2023-12-30 16:56:25.188954
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends, including changes to our business as a result of our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) in fiscal 2010. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview We are the world’s largest enterprise software company. As a result of our acquisition of Sun in January 2010, we are also a leading provider of hardware systems products and services. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software, applications software and hardware systems, consisting primarily of computer server and storage products, which are designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations. Our goal is to be the world’s most complete, open and integrated enterprise software and hardware company. We offer customers scalable, reliable, secure and integrated software and hardware solutions that are designed to improve transactional efficiencies, adapt to an organization’s unique needs and allow better ways to access and manage information and automate business processes at a lower total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets. We believe our internal, or organic, growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plan. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 we invested $3.3 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products, features and services. We also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. We are organized into three businesses—software, hardware systems and services—which are further divided into seven operating segments. Each of these businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and seven operating segments follows. Software Business Our software business, which represented 77%, 81% and 80% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software business’ total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and due to our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software Licenses: We license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we acquired certain software technologies, including Java, which is a global software development platform used in a wide range of computers, networks and devices. 33 Table of Contents The growth in new software license revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software products, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period (as provided in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q) provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business. New software license revenues represented 28%, 31% and 34% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The proportion of our new software license revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal 2010 was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun. Our new software license segment’s margins have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short term. However, our new software license segment’s margins have been and will continue to be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies that we have acquired, including Sun. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews its support contracts, (2) the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses, and (3) the amount of support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 49%, 50% and 46% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. The proportion of our software license updates and product support revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal 2010 was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun. Support margins during fiscal 2010 were 85% and accounted for 80% of our total margins. Our software license update and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: • substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal; • substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our support contract base. Even if new software license revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which add to our support contract base; and • our acquisitions have increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported. We record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of $86 million, $243 million and $179 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. To the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. 34 Table of Contents Hardware Systems Business As a result of our acquisition of Sun in January 2010, we entered into a new hardware systems business. Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010 and we expect that it will continue to add a significant amount of revenues and expenses to our results of operations in comparison to our historical operating results. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services or develop new hardware products and services. To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly, test and quality control of enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we rely on third party manufacturing partners. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. One of our main goals is to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types, through a reduction of the number of assembly and distribution centers we rely on and through our transition to a “build-to-order” process in which products are built only after customers have placed firm orders. In addition, we are focusing on identifying hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of new hardware products. Hardware Systems Products: Our hardware systems products consist primarily of computer server and storage product offerings and hardware-related software, including our Solaris operating system. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers are differentiated by their size, cost, form factor or configuration (rack, blade or stand-alone systems) and customer environments that they target (general purpose or specialized systems). Our mid- and large-size servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications and for customers having more computationally intensive needs. Our SPARC servers run the Solaris operating system and are designed for the most demanding mission critical enterprise environments at any scale. We also offer a wide range of x86 servers differentiated by the same features as our SPARC servers. These x86 systems are substantially based upon microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation and are also compatible with Solaris, Linux, Windows and other operating systems. Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers’ data assets and consist of tape, disk and networking solutions for open systems and mainframe server environments. Prior to our acquisition of Sun, the majority of Sun’s hardware systems products were sold through indirect channels. Although we plan to continue to sell our hardware products through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers, we have begun enhancing direct sales coverage for our hardware systems products and intend that our direct sales force will sell proportionately more of our hardware systems products in the future than they do currently. Our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Sun. In addition, business combination accounting rules require us to record acquired inventories at fair value, which generally will result in an unfavorable short-term impact to our expenses and operating margins as we sell these acquired inventories to customers in the post-combination period. We have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. 35 Table of Contents Hardware Systems Support: Customers that purchase our hardware systems products may also elect to purchase our hardware systems support offerings. Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our systems and storage products, including Solaris, and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. The growth of our hardware systems support revenues is influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased, and the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts. All of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers’ decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems’ infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed through, and by the amortization of intangible assets resulting from, our acquisition of Sun. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisition of Sun to their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date by an aggregate of $128 million for fiscal 2010. This amount would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by Sun as a standalone entity. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the support periods. Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, On Demand and education. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we expanded and enhanced our customer base and services offerings, which we believe will increase our revenues and expenses in comparison to recent periods. Our services business, which represented 14%, 19% and 20% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, has significantly lower margins than our software business. The proportion of our services revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal 2010 was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun. Consulting: Our consulting line of business primarily provides services to customers in enterprise architecture design and implementation; business/IT strategy alignment; business process simplification; solution integration; and product implementation, enhancements, and upgrades. The amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically segmentable from the products with which they relate and are performed after the customer’s purchase of the products. Our consulting revenues are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of product revenues, in particular the new software license sales of our application products. To the extent we are able to grow our products revenues, in particular our software application product revenues, we would also generally expect to be able to eventually grow our consulting revenues. On Demand: On Demand includes our Oracle On Demand and our Advanced Customer Services offerings. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we increased the volume and breadth of our On Demand services offerings, primarily with additional Advanced Customer Services offerings, including staff augmentation and managed services, to architect, implement and manage customer IT environments. We believe that our On Demand offerings provide our customers flexibility in how they manage their IT environments and an additional opportunity to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive advantage. While we have grown the base of customers that purchase certain of our On Demand services through our organic growth and the acquisition of Sun, we continue to focus on managing our expenses to increase our margins and margins as a percentage of our revenues. We have made and plan to continue to make investments in our On Demand business to support current and future revenue growth, which historically has negatively impacted On Demand margins and could do so in the future. Education: The purpose of our education services is to further the adoption and usage of our software and hardware products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. Education revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions (including our acquisition of Sun), general economic 36 Table of Contents conditions, personnel reductions in our customers’ information technology departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions. In recent periods, we believe the global economic environment has unfavorably affected customer demand for our education services, which has negatively impacted our revenues and margins. Acquisitions An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including Sun in fiscal 2010 and BEA Systems, Inc. in fiscal 2008, among others. We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our existing debt facilities, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the Codification, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation • Allowances for Doubtful Accounts In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed the below critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 37 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: (1) software, which includes new software license revenues and software license updates and product support revenues; (2) hardware systems, which includes the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers and storage products, and hardware systems support revenues; and (3) services, which include software and hardware related services including consulting, On Demand and education revenues. Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software, and exclude revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. While the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or services arrangement. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. 38 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition for Hardware Systems Products and Hardware Systems Related Services (Nonsoftware Elements) Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers and storage products. Our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverables is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware systems products and hardware systems related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of hardware products are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our systems and storage products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Hardware Systems Products and Hardware Systems Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements) In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we early adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009-13) and Accounting Standards Update 2009-14, Software (Topic 985)—Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements (ASU 2009-14). ASU 2009-13 amended existing accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements. To the extent a deliverable within a multiple-element arrangement is not accounted for pursuant to other accounting standards, including ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, ASU 2009-13 establishes a selling price hierarchy that allows for the use of an estimated selling price (ESP) to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither VSOE nor third-party evidence (TPE) is available for that deliverable. ASU 2009-14 modifies the scope of ASC 985-605 to exclude tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality. In addition, ASU 2009-14 provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to nonsoftware and software deliverables in an arrangement where the vendor sells tangible products containing software components that are essential in delivering the tangible product’s functionality. As a result of our early adoption of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14, we applied the provisions of these accounting standards updates as of the beginning of fiscal 2010. The impact of our adoption of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 was not material to our results of operations for fiscal 2010. We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the 39 Table of Contents undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to hardware systems and services based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of fair value of such elements. For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, TPE if VSOE is not available, or ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE is available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. To determine the selling price in multiple-element arrangements, we establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. For nonsoftware multiple element arrangements, TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE doesn’t exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, margin objectives, competition, geographies in which we offer our products and services, internal costs and stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements –Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including hardware systems products, hardware systems support, new software licenses, software license updates and product support, consulting, On Demand and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e. consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance 40 Table of Contents criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. On Demand is comprised of Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer Services and is a part of our services business. Oracle On Demand services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying new software licenses or hardware systems products and services. Our On Demand services provide multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our software and hardware systems products delivered at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or customer facilities. Advanced Customer Services provide customers with services to architect, implement and manage customer IT environments including software and hardware systems product management services, industry-specific solution support centers and remote and on-site expert services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from On Demand services are recognized as services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. Education revenues are a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software license revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2) where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of fair value of such elements. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are 41 Table of Contents generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our software and hardware systems businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software license revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. In addition, we sell hardware products to leasing companies that, in turn, lease these products to end-users. In transactions where the leasing companies have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user, we recognize revenue at point of shipment or point of delivery, depending on the shipping terms and if all the other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In arrangements where the leasing companies have more than insignificant recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user (defined as recourse leasing), we recognize both the product revenue and the related cost of the product as the payments are made to the leasing company by the end-user, generally ratably over the lease term. Our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length, and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize new software license revenues or hardware systems product revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations In fiscal 2010, we adopted ASC 805, Business Combinations, which revised the accounting guidance that we were required to apply for our acquisitions in comparison to prior fiscal years. The underlying principles are similar to the previous guidance and require that we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. As a result of adopting the revised accounting guidance provided for by ASC 805 as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, certain of our policies differ when accounting for acquisitions in fiscal 2010 and prospective periods in comparison to the accounting for acquisitions in fiscal 2009 and prior periods, including: • the fair value of in-process research and development is recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which time the intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life, or abandoned, at which time the intangible asset is expensed (prior to fiscal 2010, in-process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date); 42 Table of Contents • the direct transaction costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred (prior to fiscal 2010, direct transaction costs were included as part of the purchase price); • the costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company are accounted for separately from the business combination (prior to fiscal 2010, restructuring and exist costs were included as a part of the assumed obligations in deriving the purchase price allocation); and • any changes in estimates associated with income tax valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions after the measurement period are generally recognized as income tax expense with application of this policy also applied prospectively to all of our business combinations regardless of the acquisition date (prior to fiscal 2010, any such changes in estimates associated with income taxes were generally included as a part of the purchase price allocation indefinitely). Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, support obligations assumed, estimated restructuring liabilities and pre-acquisition contingencies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, hardware systems product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of both software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these support obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $86 million, $243 million and $179 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by Sun as an independent entity in the amount of $128 million for fiscal 2010. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we intend to focus our efforts on renewing acquired hardware systems support contracts. To the extent software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year. 43 Table of Contents In connection with a business combination, we estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. As noted above, we account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination. These costs are accounted for as one-time termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we determine that a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date, we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary purchase price allocation. We often continue to gather information for and evaluate our pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre-acquisition contingencies during the measurement period, such amounts will be included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and, subsequently, in our results of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the uncertain tax positions estimated value or tax related valuation allowances, changes to these uncertain tax positions’ and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. The provisions of ASC 350 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, did not result in an impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2009 or 2008. 44 Table of Contents We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the U.S. are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the U.S. and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly 45 Table of Contents judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. In addition, we have applied certain of the provisions of the SEC’s guidance contained in ASC 718, in our accounting for stock-based compensation awards. We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures upon historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. As required by ASC 718, we recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments that are expected to vest. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates. Stock-based compensation expense recorded using an 46 Table of Contents estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of our publicly traded, longest-term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. Our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method pursuant to ASC 718. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded, longest-term options, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, amongst other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends. If the historical data we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Sun in our third quarter of fiscal 2010. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of BEA Systems, Inc. in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. 47 Table of Contents In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues, software license updates and product support revenues, hardware systems products revenues (as applicable) and hardware systems support revenues (as applicable) for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date. We also are able to quantify the total incremental expenses associated with our hardware systems products and hardware systems support operating segments. For fiscal 2010, we include estimates of Sun’s contributions to our total revenues and total operating income. These Sun estimates are based in part on management’s estimates and allocations of Sun’s direct revenue and expense contributions which cannot be separately identified as a result of our ongoing integration of the Sun and Oracle businesses. The incremental contributions of our other acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments’ revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and • although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we intend to focus our efforts on renewing hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as software license updates and product support deferred revenues and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the rates in effect on May 31, 2009, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.22 million in fiscal 2010 (using 1.22 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.39 million in fiscal 2009 (using 1.39 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2010 results using the fiscal 2009 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 48 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2010 Actual Constant 2009 Actual Constant 2008 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 13,819 16% 15% $ 11,900 5% 8% $ 11,330 EMEA(1) 8,938 12% 13% 7,948 0% 11% 7,945 Asia Pacific(2) 4,063 19% 12% 3,404 8% 13% 3,155 Total revenues 26,820 15% 14% 23,252 4% 10% 22,430 Total Operating Expenses 17,758 19% 18% 14,931 2% 7% 14,586 Total Operating Margin $ 9,062 9% 6% $ 8,321 6% 15% $ 7,844 Total Operating Margin % 34% 36% 35% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 52% 51% 51% EMEA 33% 34% 35% Asia Pacific 15% 15% 14% Total Revenues by Business: Software $ 20,625 9% 8% $ 18,877 6% 12% $ 17,843 Hardware Systems 2,290 * * — * * — Services 3,905 -11% -12% 4,375 -5% 1% 4,587 Total revenues $ 26,820 15% 14% $ 23,252 4% 10% $ 22,430 % Revenues by Business: Software 77% 81% 80% Hardware Systems 9% 0% 0% Services 14% 19% 20% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) Asia Pacific includes Japan * Not meaningful Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Our total revenues and operating margin for fiscal 2010 were favorably impacted by the movement of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major currencies. Total revenues increased in fiscal 2010 due to an estimated $2.8 billion revenue contribution from Sun, primarily in our hardware systems business, and an increase in our total software revenues resulting from growth in our new software licenses revenues and our software license updates and product support revenues. These increases were partially offset by a constant currency decrease in our total services revenues that we believe was caused by weaker demand for IT services due to the deterioration in global economic conditions in recent periods. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 32% and APAC contributed 13% to our total revenues growth. Excluding the unfavorable effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal 2010 was due to additional operating expenses incurred as a result of our acquisition of Sun, including increased expenses pertaining to hardware systems products sold and related hardware systems support offerings, additional employee related expenses including additional stock-based compensation, and an increase in intangible asset amortization. In addition, we also incurred increased restructuring expenses resulting from our Sun Restructuring Plan and legacy Oracle-based restructuring plans. These increases were partially offset by expense reductions in our legacy Oracle-based operations including expense reductions in our services business, reductions in bad debt expenses due to improved collections and reductions to travel expenses due to cost management initiatives. 49 Table of Contents On a constant currency basis, our operating margin increased during fiscal 2010 due to higher revenues from our software business, partially offset by an estimated $620 million reduction to our operating income from Sun. Our operating margin as a percentage of revenues declined in fiscal 2010 due to the post-combination expense contributions from our new hardware systems business and due to our acquisition related expenses, restructuring expenses and amortization of intangible assets, which increased at a faster rate than our total revenues, primarily due to Sun. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Our operating results for fiscal 2009 were unfavorably impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major international currencies. These currency variances resulted in a reduction to our total revenues growth of 6 percentage points during fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, total revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher software license update and product support revenues in all regions and incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions, primarily our acquisition of BEA. On a constant currency basis, new software license revenues contributed 5% to the growth in total revenues, software license updates and product support revenues contributed 92% and services revenues contributed 3%. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 39% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA contributed 42% and Asia Pacific contributed 19%. Favorable currency variances resulted in a reduction to our total operating expense growth of 5 percentage points during fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to higher salary expenses associated with increased headcount levels from acquisitions (primarily BEA) and higher amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions (primarily BEA). In addition, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2009 due to a $57 million gain on property sale recognized in fiscal 2008, which decreased our net operating expenses in that period. These increases were partially offset by constant currency decreases in our variable compensation expenses. Currency variances resulted in a reduction of 9 percentage points to our total operating margin growth during fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal 2009 as the growth rate of our total revenues exceeded the growth rate of our total operating expenses. The growth rate in our total operating expenses was significantly impacted by the growth rate in our intangible asset amortization, which was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a part of the BEA transaction, and to a lesser extent, our restructuring expenses growth. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges and Gains and Estimated Sun Margin Contribution To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results include the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions as well as certain other significant expense and income items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges and Gains: Software license updates and product support deferred revenues(1) $ 86 $ 243 $ 179 Hardware systems support deferred revenues(1) 128 — — Hardware systems products expenses(2) 29 — — Amortization of intangible assets (3) 1,973 1,713 1,212 Acquisition related and other(4)(6) 154 117 124 Restructuring(5) 622 117 41 Stock-based compensation(6) 421 340 257 Income tax effects(7) (1,054 ) (730 ) (535 ) Total $ 2,359 $ 1,800 $ 1,278 Supplemental Disclosure Related to Estimated Sun Margin Contribution: Estimated operating loss contribution from Sun(8) $ (620 ) $ — $ — Estimated operating income contribution from Sun, as adjusted(8) $ 371 $ — $ — 50 Table of Contents (1) In connection with purchase price allocations related to our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the software support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amounts of $86 million, $243 million and $179 million in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by Sun as an independent entity in the amount of $128 million for fiscal 2010. Approximately $61 million and $25 million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2012 and beyond, respectively, that would have otherwise been recognized by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of these business combination accounting rules. In addition, approximately $148 million, $35 million and $11 million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013, respectively, that would have otherwise been recognized by Sun as an independent entity. To the extent customers renew these support contracts, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contract value over the support renewal period. (2) Represents the effects of fair value adjustments to our inventories acquired from Sun that were sold to customers in the periods presented. Business combination accounting rules require us to account for inventories assumed from our acquisitions at their fair values. The $29 million included in the hardware systems products expenses line in the table above is intended to reflect our hardware systems products expenses that would have been otherwise recorded by Sun as a standalone entity upon the sale of these inventories. If we acquire inventories in future acquisitions, we will be required to assess their fair values, which may result in fair value adjustments to those inventories. (3) Represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions, primarily Sun Microsystems, Inc., BEA Systems, Inc., Hyperion Solutions Corporation, Siebel Systems, Inc. and PeopleSoft, Inc. As of May 31, 2010, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2011 $ 2,285 Fiscal 2012 2,006 Fiscal 2013 1,638 Fiscal 2014 1,354 Fiscal 2015 1,015 Thereafter 638 Total intangible assets subject to amortization 8,936 In-process research and development 385 Total intangible assets, net $ 9,321 (4) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments after the measurement period or purchase price allocation period has ended, and certain other operating expenses, net. For fiscal 2008, acquisition related and other expenses include a gain on property sale of $57 million. As a result of our adoption of ASC 805, Business Combinations, as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, certain acquisition related and other expenses are now recorded as expenses in our statements of operations that had been historically included as a part of the consideration transferred and capitalized as a part of our accounting for acquisitions pursuant to previous accounting rules, primarily direct transaction costs such as professional services fees (see further discussion under “Business Combinations” within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section above). (5) Substantially all restructuring expenses during fiscal 2010 relate to employee severance, facility exit costs and contract termination costs in connection with our Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan and our Sun Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2009 primarily relate to costs incurred pursuant to the Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan and the Fiscal 2008 Oracle Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2008 primarily relate to costs incurred pursuant to the Fiscal 2008 Oracle Restructuring Plan. As a result of our adoption of ASC 805, Business Combinations as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, in connection with any acquisition that we close we will record involuntary termination and other exit costs associated with the acquisition to restructuring expenses, which is a change in the required accounting in comparison to fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. See further discussion regarding certain of our restructuring plans in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 51 Table of Contents (6) Stock-based compensation is included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year ended May 31, 2010 2009 2008 Sales and marketing $ 81 $ 67 $ 51 Software license updates and product support 17 13 10 Hardware systems products 3 — — Hardware systems support 2 — — Services 14 12 13 Research and development 172 155 114 General and administrative 132 93 69 Subtotal 421 340 257 Acquisition related and other 15 15 112 Total stock-based compensation $ 436 $ 355 $ 369 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those options and restricted stock-based awards. (7) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the expense and income items within the table above and resulted in an effective tax rate of 27.1% for fiscal 2010 instead of 25.6%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to differences in jurisdictional tax rates and related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in fiscal 2010. The difference in fiscal 2010 was also due to income tax effects related to acquired tax exposures. Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 28.7% for fiscal 2009 instead of 28.6%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to the exclusion of the tax effect of an adjustment to our non-current deferred tax liability associated with acquired intangible assets. Income tax effects presented for fiscal 2008 were calculated based on our effective tax rate of 29.5%, which was consistent with our tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations. (8) For fiscal 2010, the estimated operating loss contribution from Sun was calculated based upon the margin contribution of our hardware systems business for fiscal 2010, the allocation of revenues and expenses from our software and services businesses that we estimate were attributable to Sun during fiscal 2010 and the allocation of certain other operating expenses including research and development expenses, an allocation of general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, an allocation of acquisition related and other expenses and an allocation of restructuring expenses that we estimated were attributable to Sun during fiscal 2010. Our estimated operating income contribution from Sun, as adjusted, excludes certain of these charges as further presented in the reconciliation below. A reconciliation of the margin contribution of our hardware systems business as presented in our discussion of our operational results to our measures of estimated operating loss contribution from Sun and our estimated operating income contribution from Sun, as adjusted, was as follows for fiscal 2010 (in millions): EstimatedSun MarginContributionbeforeAdjustments Adjustments EstimatedSun MarginContribution,as Adjusted Hardware systems business direct revenues and expenses, net(a) $ 650 $ 157 $ 807 Stock-based compensation(a) (7 ) 7 — Amortization of intangible assets, hardware systems business(a) (260 ) 260 — Total hardware systems business margin(a) 383 424 807 Allocation of margin from other Sun businesses(b) 63 103 166 Research and development expenses(c) (476 ) 7 (469 ) Allocation of general and administrative expenses and other(c) (136 ) 3 (133 ) Allocation of acquisition related and other expenses(d) (112 ) 112 — Allocation of restructuring expenses(d) (342 ) 342 — Total estimated operating (loss) income from Sun $ (620 ) $ 991 $ 371 52 Table of Contents (a) Obtained or derived from the total margin of, and other expenses allocated to, our hardware systems businesses as reported in our results of operations for our hardware systems business. Our hardware systems business’ direct revenues and expenses, net, prior to adjustment include fair value adjustments of $128 million related to our hardware systems support revenues and $29 million related to our hardware systems products expenses. As adjusted, our hardware systems business’ direct revenues and expenses, net, exclude these fair value adjustments and also exclude an allocation of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. Refer to footnotes (1), (2), (3) and (6) above for additional discussion related to these excluded items. (b) Represents management’s estimated allocation of Sun’s direct revenues and expenses contributions to our software and services businesses. Our allocation before adjustments includes the following that we attribute to Sun: amortization of intangible assets of $59 million, fair value adjustments of $41 million related to our software license updates and product support revenues, and stock-based compensation of $3 million. Our allocation of margin from other Sun businesses, as adjusted, excludes these items. Refer to footnotes (1), (3) and (6) above for additional discussion related to these excluded items. (c) Represents management’s estimated research and development expenses attributable to Sun and management’s estimated allocation of general and administrative expenses and other attributable to Sun, and includes $7 million and $3 million of stock-based compensation, respectively, prior to adjustment. These items were excluded from the as adjusted numbers presented. See further discussion regarding these excluded items in footnote (6) above. (d) Represents management’s estimated allocation of Sun acquisition related and other expenses and Sun restructuring expenses, prior to adjustment. These items were excluded from the as adjusted numbers presented. See further discussion regarding these excluded items in footnotes (4), (5) and (6) above. 53 Table of Contents Software Business Our software business consists of our new software licenses segment and software license updates and product support segment. New Software Licenses: New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware as well as our application software products. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Sales and marketing expenses are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software products, and also include marketing program costs and amortization of intangible assets.

In constant currency, database and middleware revenues and applications revenues increased by 4% and 5% in fiscal 2010, respectively, primarily due to growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 resulting from improved customer demand, our sales force’s execution and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. In reported currency, our acquisition of Sun contributed $188 million, GoldenGate contributed $78 million and other recent acquisitions contributed $21 million to the growth in our database and middleware revenues during fiscal 2010. Our recent acquisitions contributed $39 million to our fiscal 2010 applications revenues growth. 54 Table of Contents In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million increased by 2% in fiscal 2010 and represented 49% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2010 in comparison to 50% in fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total new software license expenses increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to higher variable compensation expenses and related payroll taxes resulting from higher revenues and due to additional operating expenses as a result of the Sun acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses and marketing communication expenses as a result of cost management initiatives. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, new software license margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased as our revenues increased at a faster rate than our expenses. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Our new software license revenues growth was unfavorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total new software license revenues increased slightly in fiscal 2009 as a result of a 7% increase in database and middleware revenues, partially offset by a 10% decrease in applications revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions increased new software license revenues by 6% and 7%, respectively, and were partially offset by a decrease of 4% in the Americas region. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations of 7 percentage points, database and middleware revenues grew 7% in fiscal 2009 due primarily to incremental revenues from BEA and, to a lesser extent, incremental revenues from other recently acquired products. In reported currency, BEA products contributed $459 million, and other recently acquired products contributed $21 million to the total database and middleware revenues growth in fiscal 2009. The revenue contributions from BEA products, which had been integrated with Oracle’s Fusion Middleware and were sold together, were based on our internal allocations consistent with previous periods. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points, application new software license revenues decreased in fiscal 2009 due to weaker global economic conditions and were partially offset by $60 million of revenues from recently acquired products. In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million declined by 7% in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unfavorable currency variations, and decreased to 50% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2009 from 51% in fiscal 2008. Total sales and marketing expenses were favorably impacted by 5 percentage points of currency variations during fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher salaries from increased headcount and higher amortization of intangible assets. These constant currency increases were partially offset by a reduction in our variable compensation expenses. In both reported and constant currency, total new software license margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased as our total new software license expenses growth, in particular higher amortization of intangible assets, exceeded our revenues growth. 55 Table of Contents Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from acquisitions.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 49%, EMEA contributed 39% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2010 included incremental revenues of $88 million from Sun and $56 million from our other recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $86 million, $243 million and $179 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in duration. 56 Table of Contents On a constant currency basis, total software license updates and product support expenses decreased due to reductions in our bad debt expenses from improved collections during fiscal 2010 and were partially offset by an increase in salary and benefits expenses from increased headcount, including headcount assumed from Sun. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues grew while our total expenses declined. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: The growth in our software license updates and product support revenues was unfavorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2009 for similar reasons as noted above. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 49%, EMEA contributed 38% and Asia Pacific contributed 13% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2009 included incremental revenues of $540 million from BEA and $69 million from other recently acquired companies. As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were affected by business combination accounting rules. Total software license updates and product support expenses were favorably impacted by 3 percentage points of currency variations during fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support expenses increased due to higher salary expenses associated with increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer base and higher amortization expenses resulting from additional intangible assets acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2008, both of which were primarily attributable to our acquisition of BEA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Total software license updates and product support margin increased due to an increase in revenues, while margin as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly as the growth in our amortization of intangible assets exceeded our revenues growth rate. Hardware Systems Business As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we entered into a new hardware systems business in fiscal 2010. Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: hardware systems products and hardware systems support. 57 Table of Contents Hardware Systems Products: Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our computer server and storage products. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consist of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

Our hardware systems products expenses were unfavorably affected by $29 million of fair value adjustments made pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations, for inventories we assumed from Sun and sold to customers in the post-combination period. 58 Table of Contents Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware systems and storage products and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware systems support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with hardware systems support contracts and customer relationships obtained from the Sun acquisition.

Our hardware systems support revenues were attributable to hardware systems support contracts that we assumed through our acquisition of Sun and, to a lesser extent, support contracts that were purchased or renewed by customers in the post-combination period. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to support contracts in the amount of $128 million that would have been otherwise recorded by Sun as an independent entity were not recognized in fiscal 2010. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the support periods. 59 Table of Contents Services Services consist of consulting, On Demand and education. Consulting: Consulting revenues are earned by providing services to customers in the design, implementation, deployment and upgrade of our database and middleware software products as well as applications software products. The cost of providing consulting services consists primarily of personnel related expenditures.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in employee related expenses resulting from reduced headcount, including salaries, variable compensation and travel and entertainment and a reduction in external contractor related expenses. On a constant currency basis, consulting margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2010 as our revenues declined at a greater rate than our expenses. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Consulting revenues were unfavorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, we believe the decline in our consulting revenues was generally due to similar reasons as noted above. In constant currency, consulting expenses decreased during fiscal 2009 as a result of lower salary expenses due to a decrease in headcount and lower variable compensation expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher infrastructure and travel expenses (the majority of consulting travel expenses are billable to customers). On a constant currency basis, consulting margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2009 as our expenses declined at a greater rate than our revenues. On Demand: On Demand includes our Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer Services offerings. Oracle On Demand provides multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers 60 Table of Contents that are delivered either at our data center facilities, at select partner data centers, or physically on-site at customer facilities. Advanced Customer Services consists of solution lifecycle management services, database and application management services, industry-specific solution support centers and remote and on-site expert services. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we increased the volume and breadth of our Advanced Customer Services offerings, including onsite and remote operations management, hardware systems expert services, and packaged offerings that support the installation and optimization of Sun systems. The cost of providing On Demand services consists primarily of personnel related expenditures, technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities costs.

These increases were partially offset by modestly lower revenues in our legacy Oracle On Demand business. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 11%, EMEA contributed 78% and Asia Pacific contributed 11% to the increase in our On Demand revenues. On a constant currency basis, On Demand expenses increased primarily due to Sun and were partially offset by lower expenses from our legacy On Demand operations, primarily reduced employee related expenses. On a constant currency basis, On Demand margin increased primarily due to expense reductions in our legacy On Demand operations. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: On Demand revenue growth was unfavorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points in fiscal 2009. On Demand revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in each service category’s subscription base as a greater number of customers engaged us to provide IT services and outsourcing solutions. On a constant currency basis, Advanced Customer Services contributed the majority of our On Demand revenues growth. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 52%, EMEA contributed 23% and Asia Pacific contributed 25% to the increase in On Demand revenues. 61 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, On Demand expenses increased modestly in fiscal 2009 due to higher personnel related costs resulting from additional employees hired to support the increase in On Demand revenues. This expense increase was partially offset by a shift of certain U.S. based costs to global support centers in lower cost countries. Total On Demand margin and margin as a percentage of revenues improved primarily as a result of our Oracle On Demand business, which increased revenues while managing operating expenses to a modest level of growth in comparison to fiscal 2008. Our Advanced Customer Services margin and margin percentages also improved in comparison to fiscal 2008. Education: Education revenues are earned by providing instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures, facilities and external contractor costs.

On a constant currency basis, education expenses decreased in fiscal 2010 as we reduced our employee related and external contractor expenses. These expense decreases were partially offset by additional expenses, primarily employee related, from our acquisition of Sun. On a constant currency basis, education margin decreased due to our revenue decrease, while margin as a percentage of revenues increased due to expense reductions. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, education revenues decreased in fiscal 2009 for a similar reason as the fiscal 2010 decrease noted above. Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, education expenses declined in comparison to fiscal 2008, due to headcount reductions associated with restructuring actions taken and a reduction in other variable costs associated with the decline in business activity. Education margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2009 due to a decrease in our revenues. 62 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

We estimate that Sun contributed $476 million to our research and development expenses that were primarily employee related. In addition, our expenses in fiscal 2010 were also impacted by higher benefits expenses due to an increase in deferred compensation plan obligations (refer to additional discussion under “Non-Operating Income (Expense), net” below) and were partially offset by lower external contractor expenses. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Total research and development expenses were favorably affected by 3 percentage points of currency variations during fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses increased as salary expenses from higher headcount and increased stock-based compensation expenses were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expenses. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for information technology, finance, legal and human resources support functions.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Total general and administrative expenses were affected by 4 percentage points of favorable currency variations during fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, general and administrative expenses increased slightly during fiscal 2009 as a result of increased professional services fees and increased stock-based compensation expenses, which were almost entirely offset by decreases in variable compensation expenses and certain of our benefits expenses. 63 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangible Assets: Year Ended May 31, 2010 Percent Change 2009 Percent Change 2008 (Dollars in millions) Actual Constant Actual Constant Software support agreements and related relationships $ 574 5% 5% $ 549 37% 37% $ 402 Hardware systems support agreements and related relationships 29 * * — * * — Developed technology 811 12% 12% 722 40% 40% 515 Core technology 277 9% 9% 255 43% 44% 178 Customer relationships 234 56% 56% 150 77% 77% 85 Trademarks 48 30% 30% 37 16% 16% 32 Total amortization of intangible assets $ 1,973 15% 15% $ 1,713 41% 42% $ 1,212 * Not meaningful Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal 2010 due to additional amortization from acquired intangible assets that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2009, including from our acquisition from Sun. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in amortization associated with certain of our developed technology and core technology intangible assets that became fully amortized in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our intangible assets (including weighted average useful lives) and related amortization. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal 2009 due to the amortization of acquired intangibles from BEA and, to a lesser extent, other acquisitions that we consummated since the beginning of fiscal 2008. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments after the measurement periods or purchase price allocation periods have ended, and certain other operating expenses, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. As a result of our adoption of the FASB’s revised accounting standard for business combinations as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, certain acquisition related and other expenses were recorded as expenses in our fiscal 2010 statement of operations that had been historically included as a part of the consideration transferred and capitalized as a part of our accounting for acquisitions pursuant to previous accounting rules, primarily direct transaction costs such as professional services fees.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses decreased due to lower stock-based compensation expenses in fiscal 2009 caused primarily by the timing of stock option accelerations for certain former Hyperion and BEA employees that were incurred in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008. This decrease was almost entirely offset by higher transitional and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from our acquisition of BEA and an increase in certain acquisition related adjustments subsequent to the end of the purchase price allocation period. In addition, we also recognized a gain on property sale in fiscal 2008, which reduced our net expenses in that period. Restructuring expenses: Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. Beginning in fiscal 2010, our adoption of the FASB’s revised accounting standard for business combinations required that, in connection with any prospective acquisition, we record involuntary employee termination and other exit costs associated with such acquisition to restructuring expenses in our consolidated financial statements (see further discussion under “Business Combinations” within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section above). For additional information regarding our Oracle-based and acquired company restructuring plans, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

We also incurred restructuring expenses pursuant to our Sun Restructuring Plan, which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to better align our cost structure as a result of our acquisition of Sun. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2009 Plan and Sun Restructuring Plan are approximately $453 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as the costs are recognized. Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2009 were as noted below. Our estimated costs may be subject to change in future periods. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: During fiscal 2009, we recorded $85 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2009 Plan. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, our management approved, committed to, initiated, and subsequently amended, a plan to restructure and improve efficiencies in our Oracle-based operations (the 2008 Plan). We incurred expenses of $39 million and $41 million during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively, pursuant to the 2008 Plan.

These increases were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with the maturities and repayments of $1.0 billion of senior notes and related variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements in both May 2009 and May 2010. 65 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2009 due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in April 2008. Non-Operating Income (Expense), net: Non-operating income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan), and net other income (losses) including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

Effective December 1, 2009, we designated our Venezuelan subsidiary as “highly inflationary” in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, and began using the U.S. Dollar as the subsidiary’s new functional currency. During our third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency. As a result of the devaluation, we recognized $81 million of foreign currency losses in fiscal 2010 due to the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities and conversion of certain cash balances of our Venezuelan subsidiary into U.S. Dollars. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Our foreign currency losses, net were partially offset by interest income, which was lower in fiscal 2010 due to a general decline in market interest rates that resulted in lower yields earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and by an increase in other income, net resulting from favorable changes in asset values that support our deferred compensation plan obligations that resulted primarily from favorable changes in the values of our marketable securities that we classify as trading and are held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations. These favorable variances in the asset values of our marketable securities offset the unfavorable variances in the obligations associated with our deferred compensation plan that are included in our operating expenses such that there is no impact to our income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2010 or any other period presented. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Non-operating income (expense), net decreased during fiscal 2009 as a result of a reduction in our interest income, primarily due to lower market rates that affected the yields earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, net foreign currency transaction losses of $55 million in comparison to net foreign currency transaction gains of $40 million in the corresponding prior year and a decrease in other income, net due to a reduction in the value of our investments that we classify as trading that support our deferred compensation plan obligations (see additional discussion of the accounting for these assets and obligations above). Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.

Commissioner, and settlements with various worldwide tax authorities, offset by higher income before provision for income taxes, which yielded a higher provision for income taxes which was primarily the result of a lower proportion of our worldwide taxable income being earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Provision for income taxes decreased during fiscal 2009 in comparison to fiscal 2008 due to a lower effective tax rate, which was primarily the result of a higher proportion of our worldwide taxable income being earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Working capital $ 12,313 31% $ 9,432 17% $ 8,074 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 18,469 46% $ 12,624 14% $ 11,043 Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2010 in comparison to May 31, 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2010 and our issuance of $4.5 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2009. These increases were partially offset by $5.6 billion of net cash used for our acquisition of Sun and other companies, the reclassification of $2.2 billion of our senior notes due January 2011 as a current liability, $700 million of cash used to repay Sun’s legacy convertible notes shortly after the closing of the acquisition (see additional discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources below and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), repurchases of our common stock and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our working capital may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are variable. The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2009 in comparison to May 31, 2008 was due to the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2009. This increase in working capital was partially offset by an increase in our stock repurchases during fiscal 2009 in comparison to the prior year (we used $4.0 billion of cash for stock repurchases during fiscal 2009 in comparison to $2.0 billion used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2008), cash used for our acquisitions, cash used to repay $1.0 billion of our senior notes that matured in May 2009 and the reclassification of $1.0 billion of our senior notes due May 2010 as a current liability, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders for the first time in our history, and the decline in value of our net current assets held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar during fiscal 2009 (the offset to which was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet). Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2010 in comparison to May 31, 2009 was primarily due to cash generated from our operating activities and our issuance of $4.5 billion of senior notes in July 2009. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $16.6 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2010. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet). As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against certain major international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2010, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased as of May 31, 2010 relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2009. Our increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were partially offset by $5.6 billion of net cash used for our acquisition of Sun and 67 Table of Contents other companies, the repayment of $700 million of Sun’s legacy convertible notes, repurchases of our common stock, and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2009 in comparison to May 31, 2008 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our reported cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2009, which reduced the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for our foreign subsidiaries relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were also partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions, the repayment of $1.0 billion of senior notes in May 2009, the repurchases of our common stock (see discussion above), and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 53 days at May 31, 2010 compared with 58 days at May 31, 2009. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the adjustment that reduces our acquired software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value. Our decrease in days sales outstanding is primarily due to improved cash collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 8,681 5% $ 8,255 12% $ 7,402 Cash used for investing activities $ (10,319 ) 297% $ (2,599 ) -71% $ (9,076 ) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 2,664 160% $ (4,422 ) -235% $ 3,281 Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software license sales, sales of hardware systems products and hardware systems support and, to a lesser extent, services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and, as a result of our acquisition of Sun, materials costs related to the manufacturing of our hardware systems products. We also make cash payments related to taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to higher net income adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation and was partially offset by the operating cash flow effects of an increase to our net trade receivables resulting primarily from an increase in revenues during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher net income adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and other net cash favorable balance sheet movements. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2010 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, primarily our acquisition of Sun, and cash used to purchase marketable debt securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities). Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2009 due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and a decrease in cash used to purchase marketable debt securities, net of proceeds received from sales and maturities. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt facilities as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises. 68 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2010 increased compared to cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2009 due to our issuance of $4.5 billion of senior notes, our issuances of $2.8 billion of commercial paper notes, net of repayments, and a reduction in our common stock repurchases. These increases were partially offset by additional cash used for dividend payments and the repayment of $700 million of Sun’s legacy convertible notes shortly after the closing of the Sun acquisition. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2009 increased in comparison to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2008 due to increased stock repurchases and dividend payments and decreased proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during fiscal 2009. In addition, financing activities provided cash in fiscal 2008 as a result of our issuance of $5.0 billion of long-term senior notes in April 2008 and certain commercial paper issuances, net of repayments. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 8,681 5% $ 8,255 12% $ 7,402 Capital expenditures(1) (230 ) -57% (529 ) 118% (243 ) Free cash flow $ 8,451 9% $ 7,726 8% $ 7,159 Net income $ 6,135 10% $ 5,593 1% $ 5,521 Free cash flow as a percent of net income 138% 138% 130% (1) Represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell contracts that we have financed on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion or approximately 16%, 19% and 15%, respectively, of our new software license revenues were financed through our financing division. Recent Financing Activities Senior Notes Oracle Senior Notes: As of May 31, 2010, we had $13.8 billion of senior notes outstanding including $2.2 billion of senior notes that mature in January 2011. We repaid $1.0 billion of senior notes that matured in May 2010 and $1.0 billion of senior notes that matured in May 2009. In July 2009, we issued $4.5 billion of fixed rate senior notes comprised of $1.5 billion of 3.75% notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes), $1.75 billion of 5.00% notes due July 2019 and $1.25 billion of 6.125% notes due July 2039. We issued these senior notes for general corporate purposes and to finance a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of Sun. In September 2009, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our 2014 Notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2014 Notes so that the interest obligations became variable based upon a LIBOR-based index. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Sun Convertible Notes: Shortly after the closing of our acquisition of Sun, we repaid, in full, $700 million of Sun’s legacy convertible notes during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. 69 Table of Contents Commercial Paper Commercial Paper Program: On May 11, 2010, we reduced the overall capacity of our commercial paper program from $5.0 billion to $3.0 billion after our 2009 Credit Agreement (as defined below) terminated pursuant to its terms. Commercial Paper Notes: During fiscal 2010, we issued $2.8 billion of unsecured short-term commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) pursuant to our commercial paper program, which allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws. We issued these Commercial Paper Notes to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Sun acquisition, to assist with the repayment of our $1.0 billion of senior notes that matured in May 2010 and for general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2010, we had $881 million of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at a weighted average yield, including issuance costs, of 0.28% (none outstanding as of May 31, 2009). We back-stop these notes with our revolving credit agreement and therefore, as of May 31, 2010, we consider that we have $2.1 billion of capacity remaining under our 2006 commercial paper program. Additional details of our various debt facilities and obligations are included in the “Contractual Obligations” section below and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Revolving Credit Agreements: On March 16, 2010, our $2.0 billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement dated March 17, 2009, among Oracle; the lenders named therein; Wachovia Bank, National Association, as administrative agent; BNP Paribas as syndication agent; the documentation agents named therein; and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners (the 2009 Credit Agreement), terminated pursuant to its terms. No debt was outstanding pursuant to the 2009 Credit Agreement as of its date of termination. As of May 31, 2010, we had a $3.0 billion, five-year Revolving Credit Agreement with certain lenders that we entered into in March 2006 (the 2006 Credit Agreement). Additional details regarding the 2006 Credit Agreement are included under the heading “Revolving Credit Agreements” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On October 20, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors expanded our repurchase program by $8.0 billion and as of May 31, 2010, $5.3 billion was available for share repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 43.3 million shares for $1.0 billion, 225.6 million shares for $4.0 billion, and 97.3 million shares for $2.0 billion in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend repayments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2010, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.20 per share that totaled $1.0 billion, which is an increase in comparison to fiscal 2009 in which we declared and paid the first dividend in our history to our common stockholders of $0.05 per share, which totaled $250 million. In June 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock payable on August 4, 2010 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 14, 2010. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of 70 Table of Contents our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2010: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Principal payments on short-term borrowings and long-term debt(1) $ 14,630 $ 3,130 $ — $ 1,250 $ — $ 1,500 $ 8,750 Capital leases(2) 15 15 — — — — — Interest payments on short-term borrowings and long-term debt(1) 7,543 691 578 578 516 505 4,675 Operating leases(3) 1,697 511 376 257 157 103 293 Purchase obligations(4) 742 684 27 19 6 3 3 Funding commitments(5) 3 3 — — — — — Total contractual obligations $ 24,630 $ 5,034 $ 981 $ 2,104 $ 679 $ 2,111 $ 13,721 (1) Our borrowings (excluding capital leases) consist of the following as of May 31, 2010: Principal Balance Commercial paper notes (effective interest rate of 0.28%) $ 881 5.00% senior notes due January 2011, net of discount of $1 2,249 4.95% senior notes due April 2013 1,250 3.75% senior notes due July 2014, net of fair value adjustment of $33 1,533 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $6 1,994 5.75% senior notes due April 2018, net of discount of $1 2,499 5.00% senior notes due July 2019, net of discount of $6 1,744 6.50% senior notes due April 2038, net of discount of $2 1,248 6.125% senior notes due July 2039, net of discount of $8 1,242 Total borrowings $ 14,640 We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our July 2014 senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on borrowings presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using an interest rate of 1.44%, which represented our effective interest rate as of May 31, 2010 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods. The changes in fair value of our debt associated with the interest rate risk that we are hedging pursuant to these agreements are included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of borrowings. (2) Represents remaining payments under capital leases, substantially all of which were assumed from our acquisitions. (3) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $386 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2010. (4) Represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in this amount as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. (5) Represents the maximum additional capital we may need to contribute toward our venture fund investments, which are payable upon demand. 71 Table of Contents As of May 31, 2010, we have $2.5 billion of unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant taxing authorities to pay approximately $79 million of these liabilities (these amounts have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of when they might be settled). Although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made, some or all may be made in fiscal 2011. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2011. Separately, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we agreed to acquire Phase Forward Incorporated, a provider of applications for life sciences companies and healthcare providers, for $17.00 per share in cash, amounting to approximately $810 million. Our proposed acquisition of Phase Forward is subject to stockholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. In addition, we agreed to acquire certain other companies for amounts that are not material to our business. We intend to finance our proposed acquisitions through a combination of our internally available cash, our cash generated from operations, our existing available debt capacity, additional borrowings, or from the issuance of additional securities. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, our existing available debt capacity, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software license and hardware systems products businesses) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2011. Our quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income were also impacted in the periods presented in the table below by our acquisition of Sun during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, which added a significant amount of revenues and expenses to our results of operations in comparison to our historical operating results. The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2010 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 5,054 $ 5,858 $ 6,404 $ 9,505 Gross profit $ 3,821 $ 4,530 $ 4,774 $ 7,046 Operating income $ 1,740 $ 2,178 $ 1,843 $ 3,300 Net income $ 1,124 $ 1,458 $ 1,189 $ 2,364 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.22 $ 0.29 $ 0.24 $ 0.47 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.22 $ 0.29 $ 0.23 $ 0.46 72 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 5,331 $ 5,607 $ 5,453 $ 6,861 Gross profit $ 3,805 $ 4,185 $ 4,119 $ 5,441 Operating income $ 1,521 $ 1,975 $ 1,940 $ 2,884 Net income $ 1,077 $ 1,296 $ 1,329 $ 1,891 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.21 $ 0.25 $ 0.27 $ 0.38 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.21 $ 0.25 $ 0.26 $ 0.38 Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We historically have granted only stock options to our employees. The restricted stock-based awards included in the table presented below were assumed as a result of acquisitions. We recognize that options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2007 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.3% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Some of the outstanding options, which generally have a 10 year exercise period, have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. At May 31, 2010, 7% of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. Consistent with our historical practices, we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed 2.0% per year for our ongoing business. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2010, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock option and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 7.1%. 73 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants of up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option and restricted stock-based award activity from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2007 434 Options granted 202 Options and restricted stock-based awards assumed 66 Options exercised and restricted stock-based awards vested (274 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (72 ) Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2010 356 Average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures 65 Average annualized stock repurchases (122 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2010 5,026 Basic weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010 5,072 Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2010 7.1% In the money options and total restricted stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal period presented) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2010 6.6% Weighted average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010 1.3% Weighted average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010 -1.1% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to certain employees. These annual option grants are made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large, diverse financial institutions worldwide which we believe mitigates certain risks. In addition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, substantially all with relatively short maturities (see a description of our debt securities held in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2010, total interest income was $122 million with our investments yielding an average 0.59% on a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was down by 164 basis points from 2.23% for fiscal 2009. If overall interest rates fell by 50 basis points from our average of 0.59% 74 Table of Contents during fiscal 2010, our annual interest income would decline by approximately $97 million, assuming consistent investment levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2010. The cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are recorded at their fair values at May 31, 2010. May 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value Weighted AverageInterest Rate Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,914 0.75% Marketable securities 8,555 0.46% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 18,469 0.62% Interest Expense Risk Our total borrowings were $14.7 billion as of May 31, 2010, all of which were fixed rate borrowings. In September 2009, we entered into certain fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate and related debt fair value exposures associated with our $1.5 billion of senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. We do not use interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes. We have designated these swap agreements as qualifying instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to the FASB’s accounting standard for derivatives and hedging. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of our 2014 Notes due to interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements will be recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings. The periodic interest settlements, which occur at the same intervals as the 2014 Notes, are recorded as interest expense. By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Our 2014 Notes had an effective interest rate of 1.44% as of May 31, 2010, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2010, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately $15 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. In May 2010, we repaid $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and settled the variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement that was used to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations associated with such floating rate senior notes. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies and are subject to risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. We have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset these risks. Our program may be suspended from time to time. This program was active for the majority of fiscal 2010 and was suspended during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. When the program is active, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term. Although we have suspended our historical foreign currency forward contract program as of May 31, 2010, our subsidiaries continue to enter into cross-currency transactions and create cross-currency exposures via intercompany arrangements and we expect that these transactions and exposures will continue. Our ultimate 75 Table of Contents realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. Historically, we have not used foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes and have not designated these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of these historical contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded to non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. As of May 31, 2010, we estimate that certain of our U.S. Dollar and Euro functional subsidiaries have the equivalent of approximately $2.0 billion and approximately €410 million (approximately $500 million) of net intercompany receivables whereby the amounts to be received by these subsidiaries are in currencies other than U.S. Dollars or Euros, respectively, and are therefore subject to remeasurement as of each balance sheet date. As of May 31, 2010, we have no financial instruments in place to mitigate the risks associated with these foreign currency exposures. If overall foreign currency exchange rates weaken (strengthen) against both the U.S. Dollar and Euro by 10%, we estimate that we would incur approximately $250 million of remeasurement losses (gains) in connection with these intercompany balances assuming the balances remained constant with those as of May 31, 2010. Net foreign exchange transaction (losses) gains included in non-operating income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $(149) million, $(65) million and $17 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2010 were foreign currency losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations, which are more thoroughly described under “Non-Operating Income (Expense), net” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which may vary. Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet). Periodically, we hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure and provide a discussion in “Foreign Currency Net Investment Risk” below. As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2010, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries as of May 31, 2010 declined relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2009. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was a (decrease) increase of $(107) million, $(501) million, and $437 million, respectively. The following table includes the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of May 31, 2010: (in millions) U.S. DollarEquivalent at May 31, 2010 Euro $ 1,310 Japanese Yen 867 Chinese Renminbi 788 British Pound 566 Indian Rupee 513 Canadian Dollar 496 Other foreign currencies 2,413 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 6,953 76 Table of Contents If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar weakened by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would increase by approximately $695 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Foreign Currency Net Investment Risk Periodically, we hedge net assets of certain of our international subsidiaries using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our foreign currency-based investments in these subsidiaries. These contracts have been designated as net investment hedges pursuant to ASC 815. We entered into these net investment hedges for all of fiscal 2009 and the majority of fiscal 2010. We suspended this program during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and, as of May 31, 2010, we have no contracts outstanding. We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges. Under this method for each reporting period, the change in fair value of the forward contracts attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) was reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion, if any) was recognized in non-operating income (expense), net, in our consolidated statement of operations. We recorded settlements under these forward contracts in a similar manner. The fair values of both the effective and ineffective portions were recorded to our consolidated balance sheet as prepaid expenses and other current assets for amounts receivable from the counterparties or other current liabilities for amounts payable to the counterparties. Net gains (losses) on our net investment hedges reported in stockholders’ equity, net of tax effects, were $(131) million, $(41) million and $(53) million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net gains on our net investment hedges reported in non-operating income (expense), net were $1 million, $10 million and $23 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.",2023-12-30 16:56:33.488876
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends, including changes to our business as a result of our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) in fiscal 2010. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview We are the world’s largest enterprise software company and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services. We develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database and middleware software; applications software; and hardware systems, consisting primarily of computer server and storage products. Our products are built on industry standards and are engineered to work together or independently within existing customer information technology (IT), including private and public cloud computing, environments. We offer customers secure, reliable, and scalable integrated software and hardware solutions that are designed to improve business efficiencies and more easily adapt to an organization’s unique needs, at a lower total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets. We believe our internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans. An important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is to focus the engineering of our hardware and software products to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance, reliability and security to our customers. Our Oracle Exadata Database Machine and Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud products exemplify this strategy and are currently two of our most important products. Both products combine certain of our hardware and software offerings to provide an engineered system that increases computing performance relative to our competitors’ products, creating time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 we invested $4.5 billion, $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. We also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. We are organized into three businesses—software, hardware systems and services—which are further divided into seven operating segments. Each of these businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and seven operating segments follows. Software Business Our software business, which represented 68%, 77% and 81% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software business’ total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and due to our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development. 36 Table of Contents New Software Licenses: We license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. The growth in new software license revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software products, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period (as provided in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q) provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business. New software license revenues represented 26%, 28% and 31% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The proportion of our new software license revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2010 was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun. Our new software license segment’s margins have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new software license segment’s margins have been and will continue to be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies that we have acquired. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews its support contracts, (2) the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses, and (3) the amount of support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 42%, 49% and 50% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. The proportion of our software license updates and product support revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2010 was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun. Support margins during fiscal 2011 were 86% and accounted for 70% of our total margins. Our software license update and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: • substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal; • substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our support contract base. Even if new software license revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which add to our support contract base; and • our acquisitions have increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported. We recorded adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of $80 million, $86 million and $243 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. To the extent underlying support contracts 37 Table of Contents are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Hardware Systems Business As a result of our acquisition of Sun in January 2010, we entered into a new hardware systems business. Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 19% and 9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, and we expect that it will continue to add a significant amount of revenues and expenses to our results of operations in comparison to our historical operating results. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services or develop new hardware products and services. To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly, test and quality control of enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we rely on third party manufacturing partners. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We are continuing to focus on reducing costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types, through a reduction of the number of assembly and distribution centers that we rely on and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which products are built only after customers have placed firm orders. In addition, we are focusing on identifying hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of new hardware products. Hardware Systems Products: Our hardware systems products consist primarily of computer server and storage product offerings and hardware-related software, including our Oracle Solaris operating system. Our hardware systems component products are designed to be “open,” or to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as engineered systems, as with Oracle Exadata and Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers are differentiated by their reliability, security, scalability and customer environments that they target (general purpose or specialized systems). Our midsize and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications and for customers having more computationally intensive needs. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed for the most demanding mission critical enterprise environments at any scale. We also offer a wide range of x86 servers. These x86 servers are primarily based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation and are also compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers’ mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software, and networking for mainframe and open systems environments. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers. We have enhanced direct sales coverage for our hardware systems products and intend that our direct sales force will sell proportionately more of our hardware systems products in the future than they do currently. Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and operating margins that we report are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our hardware systems products, and our acquisitions and foreign currency 38 Table of Contents fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Sun and by business combination accounting rules that required us to record acquired inventories from Sun at fair value, which resulted in an unfavorable impact to our expenses and operating margins as we sold these inventories to customers during fiscal 2010. We have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Systems Support: Customers that purchase our hardware systems products may also elect to purchase our hardware systems support offerings. Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris, and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. The growth of our hardware systems support revenues is influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased, and the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts. All of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers’ decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems’ infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed through, and by the amortization of intangible assets resulting from, our acquisition of Sun. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisition of Sun to their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date by an aggregate of $148 million and $128 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by Sun as a standalone entity. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the support periods. Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, Cloud Services and education. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we expanded and enhanced our customer base and services offerings, which we believe will increase our revenues and expenses in comparison to recent periods. Our services business, which represented 13%, 14% and 19% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, has significantly lower margins than our software business and what we have recently achieved from our hardware business. The proportion of our services revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2010 was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun. Consulting: Our consulting line of business primarily provides services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. The amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically segmentable from the products with which they relate and are performed after the customer’s purchase of the products. Our consulting revenues are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of our product revenues, in particular the new software license sales of our application products. To the extent we are able to grow our products revenues, in particular our software application product revenues, we would also generally expect to be able to eventually grow our consulting revenues. Cloud Services: Our Cloud Services segment, which was formerly named On Demand, includes certain of our Oracle Cloud Services offerings and technology, and Advanced Customer Services. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we increased the volume and breadth of our Cloud Services offerings. Oracle Cloud Services are 39 Table of Contents designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-site at customer facilities. Advanced Customer Services provides support services, both onsite and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. We believe that our Cloud Services offerings provide our customers with increased business performance, reduced risk, a predictable cost and more flexibility and choice in terms of service in order to maximize the performance of their Oracle software and hardware products and services. While we have grown the base of customers that purchase certain of our Cloud Services through our organic growth and the acquisition of Sun, we continue to focus on managing our expenses to increase our margins and margins as a percentage of our revenues. We have made and plan to continue to make investments in our Cloud Services businesses to support current and future revenue growth, which historically has negatively impacted Cloud Services margins and could do so in the future. Education: The purpose of our education services is to further the adoption and usage of our software and hardware products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. Education revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, personnel reductions in our customers’ information technology departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions. Acquisitions An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including Art Technology Group, Inc. (ATG) and Phase Forward Incorporated (Phase Forward) in fiscal 2011 and Sun in fiscal 2010, among others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the Codification, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments 40 Table of Contents • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation • Allowances for Doubtful Accounts In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed the below critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: (1) software, which includes new software license revenues and software license updates and product support revenues; (2) hardware systems, which includes the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers and storage products, and hardware systems support revenues; and (3) services, which include software and hardware related services including consulting, Cloud Services and education revenues. Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software, and exclude revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. While the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. 41 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or services arrangement. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. Revenue Recognition for Hardware Systems Products and Hardware Systems Related Services (Nonsoftware Elements) Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers and storage products. Our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverables is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware systems products and hardware systems related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of hardware products are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our systems and storage products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Hardware Systems Products and Hardware Systems Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements) Beginning in fiscal 2010, we have applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements and Accounting Standards Update 2009-14, Software (Topic 985)—Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements to our multiple-element arrangements. We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue 42 Table of Contents arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to hardware systems and services based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of fair value of such elements. For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. To determine the selling price in multiple-element arrangements, we establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. For nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE doesn’t exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e. distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including hardware systems products, hardware systems support, new software licenses, software license updates and product support, consulting, Cloud Services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. 43 Table of Contents Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e. consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Our Cloud Services offerings are comprised of Oracle Cloud Services and Advanced Customer Services and are also a part of our services business. Oracle Cloud Services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying new software licenses or hardware systems products and services. Oracle Cloud Services are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-site at customer facilities. Advanced Customer Services provides support services, both onsite and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from Cloud Services are recognized as services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software license revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2) where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of fair value of such elements. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible 44 Table of Contents cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software license revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all the other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three- month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length, and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize new software license revenues or hardware systems product revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations In fiscal 2010, we adopted ASC 805, Business Combinations, which revised the accounting guidance that we were required to apply for our acquisitions in comparison to prior fiscal years. The underlying principles are similar to the previous guidance and require that we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. 45 Table of Contents Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, support obligations assumed, estimated restructuring liabilities and pre-acquisition contingencies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, hardware systems product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of both software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these support obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $80 million, $86 million and $243 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by Sun as an independent entity in the amounts of $148 million and $128 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we intend to focus our efforts on renewing acquired hardware systems support contracts. To the extent software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year. In connection with a business combination, we estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination. These costs are accounted for as one-time termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. 46 Table of Contents For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we determine that a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date, we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary purchase price allocation. We often continue to gather information for and evaluate our pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre-acquisition contingencies during the measurement period, such amounts will be included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and, subsequently, in our results of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions’ and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the uncertain tax positions’ estimated value or tax related valuation allowances, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions’ and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. The provisions of ASC 350 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, did not result in an impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2010 or 2009. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. 47 Table of Contents Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the U.S. are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the U.S. and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the U.S. or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for 48 Table of Contents our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures upon historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of our publicly traded, longest-term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of 49 Table of Contents employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. Our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method pursuant to ASC 718. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded, longest-term options, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, amongst other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends. If the historical data we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Sun in our third quarter of fiscal 2010 and, to a lesser extent, our acquisitions of ATG during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and Phase Forward during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Sun in our third quarter of fiscal 2010. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues, software license updates and product support revenues, hardware systems products revenues (as applicable) and hardware systems support revenues (as applicable) for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date. We also are able to quantify the total incremental expenses associated with our hardware systems products and hardware systems support operating segments. The incremental contributions of our other acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments’ revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. 50 Table of Contents We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and • although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as software license updates and product support deferred revenues and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the rates in effect on May 31, 2010, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.41 million in fiscal 2011 (using 1.41 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.22 million in fiscal 2010 (using 1.22 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2011 results using the fiscal 2010 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 51 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2011 Actual Constant 2010 Actual Constant 2009 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 18,352 33% 32% $ 13,819 16% 15% $ 11,900 EMEA(1) 11,497 29% 28% 8,938 12% 13% 7,948 Asia Pacific(2) 5,773 42% 32% 4,063 19% 12% 3,404 Total revenues 35,622 33% 30% 26,820 15% 14% 23,252 Total Operating Expenses 23,589 33% 31% 17,758 19% 18% 14,931 Total Operating Margin $ 12,033 33% 29% $ 9,062 9% 6% $ 8,321 Total Operating Margin % 34% 34% 36% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 52% 52% 51% EMEA 32% 33% 34% Asia Pacific 16% 15% 15% Total Revenues by Business: Software $ 24,031 17% 15% $ 20,625 9% 8% $ 18,877 Hardware Systems 6,944 203% 195% 2,290 * * — Services 4,647 19% 17% 3,905 -11% -12% 4,375 Total revenues $ 35,622 33% 30% $ 26,820 15% 14% $ 23,252 % Revenues by Business: Software 68% 77% 81% Hardware Systems 19% 9% 0% Services 13% 14% 19% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) Asia Pacific includes Japan * Not meaningful Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Our total revenues increased in fiscal 2011 due to $4.7 billion of incremental revenue contribution from our hardware systems business and significant increases in our software and services businesses’ revenues. Our total revenues growth across all of our businesses in fiscal 2011 was favorably affected by a full year of revenue contributions from Sun as compared to our fiscal 2010 operating results, for which Sun’s revenue contributions were limited to only a portion of the fiscal 2010 period. In addition, our software business revenues increased as a result of the growth in our new software license revenues and our software license updates and product support revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 29% and APAC contributed 16% to our total revenues growth. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal 2011 was due to a full year of expense contributions from Sun to our fiscal 2011 operating results, including increased expenses pertaining to hardware systems products sold and related hardware systems support offerings, additional employee related expenses, and an increase in intangible asset amortization. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in restructuring expenses relating to our Sun Restructuring Plan and certain other Oracle-based restructuring plans, and were also favorably affected by a $120 million benefit related to the recovery of legal costs, and certain other insurance recoveries in fiscal 2011. On a constant currency basis, our operating margin increased during fiscal 2011 due to our total revenues growth. Our operating margin as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2011 as our revenues and expenses grew at approximately the same rates. 52 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: On a constant currency basis, total revenues increased in fiscal 2010 due to an estimated $2.8 billion revenue contribution from Sun, primarily in our hardware systems business, and an increase in our total software revenues resulting from growth in our new software licenses revenues and our software license updates and product support revenues. These increases were partially offset by a constant currency decrease in our total services revenues that we believe was caused by weaker demand for IT services due to the deterioration in global economic conditions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 32% and APAC contributed 13% to our total revenues growth in fiscal 2010. Excluding the unfavorable effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal 2010 was due to additional operating expenses incurred as a result of our acquisition of Sun and were of a similar nature as those noted in the fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 discussion above. In addition, we also incurred increased restructuring expenses resulting from our Sun Restructuring Plan and legacy Oracle-based restructuring plans. These increases were partially offset by expense reductions in our legacy Oracle-based operations including expense reductions in our services business, reductions in bad debt expenses due to improved collections and reductions to travel expenses due to cost management initiatives. On a constant currency basis, our operating margin increased during fiscal 2010 due to higher revenues from our software business, partially offset by post-combination operating losses from Sun that related to amortization of intangible assets, acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses. Our operating margin as a percentage of revenues declined in fiscal 2010 due to the aforementioned post-combination expense contributions from Sun. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results include the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions as well as certain other significant expense items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Software license updates and product support deferred revenues(1) $ 80 $ 86 $ 243 Hardware systems support deferred revenues(1) 148 128 — Hardware systems products expenses(2) — 29 — Amortization of intangible assets(3) 2,428 1,973 1,713 Acquisition related and other(4)(6) 208 154 117 Restructuring(5) 487 622 117 Stock-based compensation(6) 500 421 340 Income tax effects(7) (1,003 ) (1,054 ) (730 ) $ 2,848 $ 2,359 $ 1,800 (1) In connection with purchase price allocations related to our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the software support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amounts of $80 million, $86 million and $243 million in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by Sun as an independent entity in the amounts of $148 million and $128 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Approximately $29 million, $9 million and $2 million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, that would have otherwise been recognized by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of these business combination accounting rules. In addition, approximately $30 million and $11 million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems 53 Table of Contents support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2012 and 2013, respectively, that would have otherwise been recognized by Sun as an independent entity. To the extent customers renew these support contracts, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contract value over the support renewal period. (2) Represents the effects of fair value adjustments to our inventories acquired from Sun that were sold to customers in the post-combination period. Business combination accounting rules require us to account for inventories assumed from our acquisitions at their fair values. The $29 million included in the hardware systems products expenses line in the table above is intended to adjust these expenses to the hardware systems products expenses that would have been otherwise recorded by Sun as an independent entity upon the sale of these inventories. If we acquire inventories in future acquisitions, we will be required to assess their fair values, which may result in fair value adjustments to those inventories. (3) Represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2011, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2012 $ 2,275 Fiscal 2013 1,902 Fiscal 2014 1,554 Fiscal 2015 1,155 Fiscal 2016 657 Thereafter 267 Total intangible assets subject to amortization 7,810 In-process research and development 50 Total intangible assets, net $ 7,860 (4) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments after the measurement period or purchase price allocation period has ended, and certain other operating expenses, net. (5) Substantially all restructuring expenses during fiscal 2011 relate to employee severance, facility exit costs and contract termination costs in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2010 primarily relate to costs incurred pursuant to our Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan and Sun Restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (6) Stock-based compensation is included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2011 2010 2009 Sales and marketing $ 87 $ 81 $ 67 Software license updates and product support 14 17 13 Hardware systems products 2 3 — Hardware systems support 5 2 — Services 16 14 12 Research and development 231 172 155 General and administrative 145 132 93 Subtotal 500 421 340 Acquisition related and other 10 15 15 Total stock-based compensation $ 510 $ 436 $ 355 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those options and restricted stock-based awards. (7) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.3% for fiscal 2011 instead of 25.1%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to differences in jurisdictional tax rates, the related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses and the income tax effects related to our acquired tax exposures. Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 27.1% for fiscal 2010 instead of 25.6%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to similar reasons as those noted for the fiscal 2011 differences. Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 28.7% for fiscal 2009 instead of 28.6%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to the exclusion of the tax effect of an adjustment to our non-current deferred tax liability associated with acquired intangible assets. 54 Table of Contents Software Business Our software business consists of our new software licenses segment and software license updates and product support segment. New Software Licenses: New software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware as well as our application software products. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Sales and marketing expenses are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software products, and also include marketing program costs and amortization of intangible assets.

On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 63%, EMEA contributed 21% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to our new software license revenues growth during fiscal 2011. In constant currency, database and middleware revenues and applications revenues increased by 19% and 20%, respectively, in fiscal 2011 primarily due to growth resulting from improved customer demand, our sales force’s execution and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. In reported currency, Sun contributed $398 million in growth to our database and middleware revenues through the third quarter of fiscal 2011 (the one year anniversary of our acquisition) and our other recent acquisitions contributed $40 million during fiscal 2011. In reported currency, our recent acquisitions contributed $191 million to the growth in our applications revenues during fiscal 2011. 55 Table of Contents In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million increased by 36% in fiscal 2011 and represented 54% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2011 in comparison to 49% in fiscal 2010. Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher employee related and other operating expenses resulting from a full year of expense contributions from Sun to our fiscal 2011 operating results and higher variable compensation expenses resulting from higher revenues. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, new software license margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased as our revenues increased at a faster rate than our expenses. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, total new software license revenues increased by 4% in fiscal 2010 due to growth in the Americas region and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. In constant currency, database and middleware revenues and applications revenues increased by 4% and 5% in fiscal 2010, respectively, primarily due to growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 resulting from improved customer demand, our sales force’s execution and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. In reported currency, our acquisition of Sun contributed $188 million, and other recent acquisitions contributed $99 million to the growth in our database and middleware revenues during fiscal 2010. Our recent acquisitions contributed $39 million to our fiscal 2010 applications revenues growth. In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions over $0.5 million increased by 2% in fiscal 2010 and represented 49% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2010 in comparison to 50% in fiscal 2009. Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total new software license expenses increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to higher variable compensation expenses and related payroll taxes resulting from higher revenues and due to additional operating expenses as a result of the Sun acquisition. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses and marketing communication expenses as a result of cost management initiatives. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, new software license margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased as our revenues increased at a faster rate than our expenses. 56 Table of Contents Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from acquisitions.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 54%, EMEA contributed 33% and Asia Pacific contributed 13% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2011 included incremental revenues of $240 million from Sun through the third quarter of fiscal 2011 (the one year anniversary of our acquisition) and $80 million from our other recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $80 million, $86 million and $243 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in duration. 57 Table of Contents On a constant currency basis, total software license updates and product support expenses increased due to an increase in salaries, variable compensation and benefits expenses that were primarily related to a full year’s contribution from Sun and certain other headcount increases and, to a lesser extent, an increase in bad debt expenses resulting from higher revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses, primarily as a result of a slight decline in amortization of intangible assets. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: On a constant currency basis, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2010 for similar reasons as noted above. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 49%, EMEA contributed 39% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2010 included incremental revenues of $88 million from Sun and $56 million from our other recently acquired companies. As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were affected by business combination accounting rules. On a constant currency basis, total software license updates and product support expenses decreased due to reductions in our bad debt expenses during fiscal 2010 and were partially offset by an increase in salary and benefits expenses from increased headcount, including headcount assumed from Sun. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues grew while our total expenses declined. Hardware Systems Business As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we entered into a new hardware systems business in fiscal 2010. Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: hardware systems products and hardware systems support. 58 Table of Contents Hardware Systems Products: Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our computer server and storage products. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consist of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

In fiscal 2010, our hardware systems products expenses and total margin were unfavorably impacted by $29 million of fair value adjustments made pursuant to business combination accounting rules for inventories we assumed from Sun and sold to customers in the post-combination period. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses. 59 Table of Contents Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware systems and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware systems support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with hardware systems support contracts and customer relationships obtained from the Sun acquisition.

As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $148 million and $128 million that would have been otherwise recorded by Sun as an independent entity were not recognized in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the future support periods. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses. Services Services consist of consulting, Cloud Services and education. 60 Table of Contents Consulting: Consulting revenues are earned by providing services to customers in the design, implementation, deployment and upgrade of our database and middleware software products as well as applications software products. The cost of providing consulting services consists primarily of personnel related expenditures.

On a constant currency basis, our expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2011 as a reduction in salary and related expenses from reduced headcount was offset primarily by increases in external contractor expenses and variable compensation. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2011 as our total revenues increased while our expenses remained relatively flat. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, we believe the decline in our consulting revenues in fiscal 2010 was generally due to weaker demand resulting from reduced IT spending on services by our customers as a result of the deterioration of global economic conditions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in employee related expenses resulting from reduced headcount, including salaries, variable compensation and travel and entertainment and a reduction in external contractor related expenses. On a constant currency basis, consulting margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2010 as our revenues declined at a greater rate than our expenses. Cloud Services: Cloud Services, which was formerly named On Demand, includes certain of our Oracle Cloud Services and our Advanced Customer Services offerings. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we increased the volume and breadth of our Cloud Services offerings. Oracle Cloud Services’ managed services are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-site at customer facilities. Advanced 61 Table of Contents Customer Services provides support services, both on-site and remote, to customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. The cost of providing our Cloud Services offerings consists primarily of personnel related expenditures, technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities costs.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 49%, EMEA contributed 42% and Asia Pacific contributed 9% to the increase in our Cloud Services revenues. On a constant currency basis, Cloud Services expenses increased primarily due to additional employee related expenses associated with a full fiscal year of expense contributions from Sun and higher third party contractor expenses that supported the increase in our revenues. On a constant currency basis, both Cloud Services margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2011 as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase in our Cloud Services revenues was primarily due to revenue contributions from Sun and increased revenues from our legacy Advanced Customer Services offerings. These increases were partially offset by modestly lower revenues in our legacy Oracle Cloud Services business. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 11%, EMEA contributed 78% and Asia Pacific contributed 11% to the increase in our Cloud Services revenues. On a constant currency basis, Cloud Services expenses increased primarily due to Sun and were partially offset by lower expenses from our legacy Cloud Services operations, primarily reduced employee related expenses. On a constant currency basis, Cloud Services margin increased primarily due to expense reductions in our legacy Cloud Services operations, while margin as a percentage of revenues was flat. 62 Table of Contents Education: Education revenues are earned by providing instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 38%, EMEA contributed 38% and Asia Pacific contributed 24% to the increase in our education revenues during fiscal 2011. On a constant currency basis, education margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2011 as a result of our total revenues increasing at a faster rate than our total expenses. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: On a constant currency basis, education revenues decreased in fiscal 2010 as we experienced weaker demand for our educational services that we believe was the result of reduced IT spending on services by our customers due to weaker global economic conditions, partially offset by additional revenues from our acquisition of Sun. On a constant currency basis, education expenses decreased in fiscal 2010 as we reduced our legacy Oracle-based employee related and external contractor expenses. These expense decreases were partially offset by additional expenses, primarily employee related, from our acquisition of Sun. On a constant currency basis, education margin decreased due to our revenue decrease, while margin as a percentage of revenues increased due to expense reductions. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: On a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses increased during fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses similar to those noted above as a result of our acquisition of Sun. In addition, our expenses in fiscal 2010 were also impacted by higher benefits expenses due to an increase in deferred compensation plan obligations and were partially offset by lower external contractor expenses.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: On a constant currency basis, total general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal 2010 due to additional employee related and professional services expenses resulting from our acquisition of Sun, and higher stock-based compensation expenses primarily resulting from higher fair values of our legacy stock options that were recognized as expense in fiscal 2010.

These 64 Table of Contents increases were partially offset by a reduction in amortization associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized in fiscal 2011. Amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal 2010 in comparison to fiscal 2009 due to additional amortization from acquired intangible assets that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2009, including from our acquisition of Sun. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our intangible assets (including weighted average useful lives) and related amortization. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments after the measurement periods or purchase price allocation periods have ended, and certain other operating expenses, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. As a result of our adoption of the FASB’s revised accounting standard for business combinations as of the beginning of fiscal 2010, certain acquisition related and other expenses were recorded as expenses in our fiscal 2011 and 2010 statements of operations that had been historically included as a part of the consideration transferred and capitalized as a part of our accounting for acquisitions pursuant to previous accounting rules, primarily direct transaction costs such as professional services fees.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to higher employee related and professional services expenses resulting from our acquisition of Sun. Restructuring expenses: Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. Beginning in fiscal 2010, our adoption of the FASB’s revised accounting standard for business combinations required that, in connection with any prospective acquisition, we record involuntary employee termination and other exit costs associated with such acquisition to restructuring expenses in our consolidated financial statements.

To a lesser extent, we also incurred expenses associated with other Oracle-based plans, which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to restructure and 65 Table of Contents further improve efficiencies in our Oracle-based operations. We incurred restructuring expenses of $439 million in connection with the Sun Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2011. The total estimated remaining restructuring costs associated with the Sun Restructuring Plan are approximately $250 million, and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as the costs are incurred. Our estimated costs may be subject to change in future periods. Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2010 were as noted below. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: During fiscal 2010, we recorded restructuring expenses primarily in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan and our Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2009 Plan). During fiscal 2009, we primarily incurred restructuring expenses associated with the 2009 Plan.

This interest expense increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with the maturities and repayments of $2.25 billion of senior notes, which matured in January 2011, and $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and related variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements in May 2010. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2010 due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $4.5 billion of senior notes in July 2009 and, to a lesser extent, our issuance of $2.8 billion of commercial paper notes in fiscal 2010 of which $881 million was outstanding as of May 31, 2010. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with the maturities and repayments of $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and related variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements in both May 2009 and May 2010. Non-Operating Income (Expense), net: Non-operating income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan), and net other income (losses) including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

In addition, our interest income increased in fiscal 2011 due to larger average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and other income, net increased in fiscal 2011 as a result of gains recognized on the sale of certain equity investments. 66 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: We incurred non-operating expenses, net in fiscal 2010 in comparison to non-operating income, net in fiscal 2009 primarily due to net foreign currency losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations in fiscal 2010 as described above. Additionally, interest income decreased in fiscal 2010 due to a general decline in market interest rates that resulted in lower yields earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Both of the aforementioned items contributed to the change in fiscal 2010 but were partially offset by gains due to favorable changes in the values of our marketable securities that we classify as trading that were held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations. Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Provision for income taxes decreased during fiscal 2010 primarily due to recent judicial decisions, including the March 2010 U.S. Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit ruling in Xilinx v. Commissioner, and settlements with various worldwide taxing authorities. These decreases were partially offset by higher income before provision for income taxes and by a lower proportion of our worldwide taxable income being earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Working capital $ 24,982 103% $ 12,313 31% $ 9,432 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 28,848 56% $ 18,469 46% $ 12,624 Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2011 in comparison to May 31, 2010 was primarily due to the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2011 and our issuance of $3.25 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2010. These increases were partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our working capital may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are variable. The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2010 in comparison to May 31, 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2010 and our issuance of $4.5 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2009. These increases were partially offset by $5.6 billion of net cash used for our acquisition of Sun and other companies, the reclassification of $2.2 billion of our senior notes that were due and repaid in January 2011 as a current liability, $700 million of cash used to repay Sun’s legacy convertible notes shortly after the closing of the acquisition, repurchases of our common stock and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, 67 Table of Contents corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2011 in comparison to May 31, 2010 was primarily due to cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of $3.25 billion of senior notes in July 2010 and $1.15 billion of short-term borrowings made pursuant to certain of our revolving credit agreements. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $20.4 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2011, $16.1 billion of which we consider indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $4.6 billion. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet). As the U.S. Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2011, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased as of May 31, 2011 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates as of May 31, 2010. The aforementioned increases in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were partially offset by the repayment of $2.25 billion of our senior notes which matured in January 2011, the repayment of $881 million of commercial paper notes, the usage of $1.9 billion of net cash for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, and the payments of cash dividends to our stockholders. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2010 in comparison to May 31, 2009 was primarily due to cash generated from our operating activities and our issuance of $4.5 billion of senior notes in July 2009. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances caused by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to certain major international currencies during fiscal 2010. Additionally, the increase in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances was partially offset by $5.6 billion of net cash used for our acquisition of Sun and other companies, the repayment of $700 million of Sun’s legacy convertible notes, repurchases of our common stock, and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the most recently completed fiscal quarter, modestly increased to 55 days at May 31, 2011 in comparison to 53 days at May 31, 2010. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the adjustment that reduces our acquired software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value.

Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software license sales, sales of hardware systems products and hardware systems support arrangements and, to a lesser extent, services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2011 and 2010 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation in each of these periods. These increases in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital, primarily increases in net trade receivables resulting from increases in revenues during our fiscal fourth quarters of fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, in comparison to the prior fiscal years. 68 Table of Contents Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2011 due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our acquisitions) and a decrease in cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities), partially offset by an increase in net capital expenditures. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2010 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, primarily our acquisition of Sun, and an increase in cash used to purchase marketable debt securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities). Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt facilities as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 decreased due to a reduction in the amount of debt that we issued in fiscal 2011 ($1.15 billion borrowed pursuant to our revolving credit facilities and $3.25 billion of long-term senior notes issued) in comparison to fiscal 2010 ($4.5 billion of long-term senior notes and $2.8 billion of commercial paper notes issued). This unfavorable impact to our financing cash flows was partially offset by a cash favorable reduction in debt repayments during fiscal 2011 (repayments of $2.25 billion of senior notes in January 2011 and $881 million of commercial paper notes) in comparison to fiscal 2010 (repayments of $1.9 billion of commercial paper notes, $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and $700 million of Sun’s legacy convertible notes) and an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2010 increased compared to cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2009 due to our issuance of $4.5 billion of senior notes, our issuances of $2.8 billion of commercial paper notes, net of repayments, and a significant reduction in our common stock repurchases. These fiscal 2010 increases in cash flows from financing activities were partially offset by additional cash used for fiscal 2010 dividend payments and the fiscal 2010 repayment of $700 million of Sun’s legacy convertible notes. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Cash provided by operating activities $ 11,214 29% $ 8,681 5% $ 8,255 Capital expenditures(1) (450 ) 96% (230 ) -57% (529 ) Free cash flow $ 10,764 27% $ 8,451 9% $ 7,726 Net income $ 8,547 39% $ 6,135 10% $ 5,593 Free cash flow as a percent of net income 126% 138% 138% (1) Represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 69 Table of Contents days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. We financed $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion or approximately 16%, 16% and 19%, respectively, of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $117 million, or approximately 3%, of our hardware systems products revenues in fiscal 2011. Recent Financing Activities Revolving Credit Agreements: On May 27, 2011, we entered into two revolving credit agreements with BNP Paribas, as initial lender and administrative agent; and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner (the 2011 Credit Agreements) to borrow $1.15 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2011 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2011 Credit Agreements is based on either (x) a “base rate” calculated as the highest of (i) BNP Paribas’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the LIBOR for deposits in U.S. dollars plus 1%, or (y) LIBOR for deposits made in U.S. dollars plus 0.25%, depending on the type of borrowings made by us. Any amounts borrowed pursuant to the 2011 Credit Agreements are due no later than June 30, 2011, which is the termination date of the 2011 Credit Agreements. Additional details regarding the 2011 Credit Agreements are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. On March 14, 2011, our $3.0 billion, five-year Revolving Credit Agreement dated March 15, 2006, among Oracle; the lenders named therein, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Bank of America N.A. as syndication agent; the documentation agents named therein, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and Banc of America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners (the 2006 Credit Agreement), expired pursuant to its terms. No debt was outstanding pursuant to the 2006 Credit Agreement as of its date of expiration. Senior Notes: As of May 31, 2011, we had $14.8 billion of senior notes outstanding ($13.8 billion outstanding as of May 31, 2010). In January 2011, our 5.00% fixed rate senior notes for $2.25 billion matured and were repaid. In July 2010, we issued $3.25 billion of fixed rate senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion of 3.875% notes due July 2020 and $2.25 billion of 5.375% notes due July 2040. We issued these senior notes in order to repay indebtedness, including the repayment of our $2.25 billion of senior notes that matured in January 2011, for general corporate purposes, for future acquisitions and in order to replenish cash used to repay $1.0 billion of the floating rate senior notes that matured in May 2010. Additional details regarding these senior notes and all other borrowings are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Commercial Paper Notes: During fiscal 2011, we repaid $881 million of commercial paper notes that were issued in fiscal 2010 pursuant to our commercial paper program, which allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws. As of May 31, 2011, we had no commercial paper notes outstanding ($881 million outstanding as of May 31, 2010). Our ability to issue commercial paper notes in the future is highly dependent upon our ability to provide a back-stop by means of a revolving credit facility or other debt facility for amounts equal to or greater than the amounts of commercial paper notes we intend to issue. While presently we have no such facilities in place that may provide a back-stop to such commercial paper notes, we currently believe that, if needed, we could put in place one or more additional revolving credit or similar debt facilities in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms. Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On October 20, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors expanded our repurchase program by $8.0 billion and as of May 31, 2011, $4.1 billion was available for share repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 40.4 million shares for $1.2 billion, 43.3 million shares for $1.0 billion and 225.6 million shares for $4.0 billion in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such 70 Table of Contents as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend repayments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2011, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.21 per share that totaled $1.1 billion. In June 2011, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock payable on August 3, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 13, 2011. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2011: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Principal payments on short-term and long-term borrowings(1) $ 15,900 $ 1,150 $ 1,250 $ — $ 1,500 $ 2,000 $ 10,000 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 10,799 738 738 676 665 655 7,327 Operating leases(2) 1,570 458 341 226 159 121 265 Purchase obligations and other(3) 481 453 15 7 3 3 — Total contractual obligations $ 28,750 $ 2,799 $ 2,344 $ 909 $ 2,327 $ 2,779 $ 17,592 (1) Our total borrowings consist of the following as of May 31, 2011 (dollars in millions): Amount Short-term borrowings (effective interest rate of 0.44%) $ 1,150 4.95% senior notes due April 2013 1,250 3.75% senior notes due July 2014, including fair value adjustment of $69 1,569 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $5 1,995 5.75% senior notes due April 2018, net of discount of $1 2,499 5.00% senior notes due July 2019, net of discount of $5 1,745 3.875% senior notes due July 2020, net of discount of $2 998 6.50% senior notes due April 2038, net of discount of $2 1,248 6.125% senior notes due July 2039, net of discount of $8 1,242 5.375% senior notes due July 2040, net of discount of $25 2,225 Total borrowings $ 15,921 We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our July 2014 senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on the July 2014 senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using an interest rate of 1.38%, which represented our effective interest rate as of May 31, 2011 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods. The changes in fair value of our debt associated with the interest rate risk that we are hedging pursuant to these agreements are included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of borrowings. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $320 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, in accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2011. (3) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We 71 Table of Contents utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. We also obtain individual components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in this amount as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. As of May 31, 2011, we have $3.8 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant taxing authorities to pay approximately $96 million of these liabilities. Although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made, some or all may be made in fiscal 2012. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2012. Subsequent to fiscal 2011, we agreed to acquire certain companies for amounts that are not material to our business. We expect to close such acquisitions within the next twelve months. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software license and hardware systems products) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short-term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2012. Our quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income were also impacted in the periods presented in the table below by our acquisition of Sun during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, which added a significant amount of revenues and expenses to our results of operations in comparison to our historical operating results. 72 Table of Contents The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2011 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 7,502 $ 8,582 $ 8,764 $ 10,775 Gross profit $ 5,401 $ 6,384 $ 6,707 $ 8,544 Operating income $ 1,917 $ 2,770 $ 2,987 $ 4,359 Net income $ 1,352 $ 1,870 $ 2,116 $ 3,209 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.27 $ 0.37 $ 0.42 $ 0.63 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.27 $ 0.37 $ 0.41 $ 0.62 Fiscal 2010 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 5,054 $ 5,858 $ 6,404 $ 9,505 Gross profit $ 4,002 $ 4,712 $ 4,942 $ 7,205 Operating income $ 1,740 $ 2,178 $ 1,843 $ 3,300 Net income $ 1,124 $ 1,458 $ 1,189 $ 2,364 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.22 $ 0.29 $ 0.24 $ 0.47 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.22 $ 0.29 $ 0.23 $ 0.46 Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, our stockholders approved amendments to the Amended and Restated Oracle Corporation 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, including an amendment to increase the number of shares available under the plan by 388,313,015 shares. We historically have granted only stock options to our employees. The restricted stock-based awards included in the table presented below were assumed as a result of our acquisitions. We recognize that options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2008 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.3% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Some of the outstanding options, which generally have a 10 year exercise period, have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. At May 31, 2011, 1.8% of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2011, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock option and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 7.0%. 73 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants of up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option and restricted stock-based award activity from June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2011 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2008 379 Options granted 251 Options and restricted stock-based awards assumed 33 Options exercised and restricted stock-based awards vested (220 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (87 ) Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2011 356 Average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures 66 Average annualized stock repurchases (103 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2011 5,068 Basic weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2011 5,044 Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2011 7.0% In the money options and total restricted stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal period presented) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2011 6.9% Weighted average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2011 1.3% Weighted average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2011 -0.7% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to certain employees. These annual option grants are made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large, diverse financial institutions worldwide which we believe mitigates certain risks. In addition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, substantially all with relatively short maturities (see a description of our debt securities held in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. 74 Table of Contents Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2011, total interest income was $163 million with our investments yielding an average 0.62% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the fair value of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2011 and 2010. May 31, 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value WeightedAverageInterestRate Fair Value WeightedAverageInterest Rate Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,163 0.61% $ 9,914 0.75% Marketable securities 12,685 0.68% 8,555 0.46% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 28,848 0.64% $ 18,469 0.62% Interest Expense Risk Our total borrowings were $15.9 billion as of May 31, 2011, primarily all of which were fixed rate borrowings. Future changes in interest rates and resulting changes in estimated fair values of our borrowings other than our senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) and short-term borrowings pursuant to our 2011 Credit Agreements would not impact the interest expense we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. We have entered into certain fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate and related fair value of our 2014 Notes so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes. We have designated these swap agreements as qualifying instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of our 2014 Notes due to interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements will be recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings. The periodic interest settlements, which occur at the same intervals as the 2014 Notes, are recorded as interest expense. By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Our 2014 Notes had an effective interest rate of 1.38% as of May 31, 2011, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2011, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately $15 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies and are subject to risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. We have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset these risks. We may suspend this program from time to time and did so during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 until resuming the program in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign 75 Table of Contents currency transactions. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for unrealized gains and other current liabilities for unrealized losses. The statement of operations classification of gains or losses upon changes in fair values or cash settlement of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net. Although we have resumed our foreign currency forward contract program, we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2011, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.5 billion and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.6 billion. The net unrealized gains of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2011. As of May 31, 2010, we had a nominal amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. Net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) included in non-operating income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $11 million, $(149) million and $(65) million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2010 were foreign currency losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations, which are more thoroughly described under “Non-Operating Income (Expense), net” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which may vary. Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet). Periodically, we may hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure. 76 Table of Contents As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2011, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries as of May 31, 2011 increased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2010. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was an increase (decrease) of $600 million, $(107) million and $(501) million, respectively. The following table includes the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of May 31, 2011: (in millions) U.S. DollarEquivalent atMay 31, 2011 Euro $ 993 Chinese Renminbi 775 Indian Rupee 749 Japanese Yen 530 South African Rand 492 British Pound 436 Other foreign currencies 2,934 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 6,909 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $691 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances.",2023-12-30 16:56:34.625696
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview We are the world’s largest provider of enterprise software and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services. Our software, hardware systems, and services businesses develop, manufacture, market, host and support database and middleware software, applications software, and hardware systems, with the latter consisting primarily of computer server and storage products. Our businesses provide products and services that are built upon industry standards, are engineered to work together or independently within existing customer information technology (IT) environments and run securely on a wide range of customer IT environments, including cloud computing environments. Cloud computing environments provide on demand access to a shared pool of computing resources in a scalable, self-service manner, delivering advantages in speed, agility and efficiency. Cloud computing has evolved from technologies and services that Oracle has provided for many years, including clustering, server virtualization, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), shared services, large-scale management automation, and more recently, engineered systems. Our secure, reliable and scalable product offerings are designed to improve business efficiencies at a low total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in each of the product offering categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets. We believe our ability to offer our customers choice and flexibility in the manner in which they deploy our products and services—while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security and interoperability based upon industry-standards—is important to our corporate strategy. Oracle Fusion Applications, for example, offer customers a choice of deployment models to run our standards-based software applications in on-premise or cloud computing IT environments. Oracle Cloud, a family of our cloud-based software subscription offerings, provides access to select Oracle software applications and software platforms on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment. Oracle Cloud includes software applications as a service, such as Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management Cloud Service and Oracle Fusion Customer Relationship Management Cloud Service, and software platform services such as Oracle Database Cloud Service and Oracle Java Cloud Service, among others. We believe our internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans. In each of fiscal 2012 and 2011, we invested $4.5 billion and in fiscal 2010 we invested $3.3 billion in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. We continue to focus the engineering of our hardware and software products to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance, reliability, and security to our customers. For example, Oracle Engineered Systems, which include our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, and SPARC SuperCluster products, amongst others, combine certain of our hardware and software offerings to provide engineered systems that increase computing performance and reduce storage requirements relative to our competitors’ products, creating time savings, efficiencies, and operational cost advantages for our customers. We also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. 38 Table of Contents We are organized into three businesses—software, hardware systems and services—which are further divided into certain operating segments. Prior to our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) in January 2010, we did not have a hardware systems business or related operating segments. Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows. Software Business Our software business, which represented 70%, 68% and 77% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and (2) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software business’ total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts and due to our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software Licenses: We license our database and middleware as well as our applications software and provide subscription-based access to select Oracle software applications and software platforms through a cloud-based IT environment to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. The growth in new software license revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software products, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period (as provided in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q) provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business. New software license revenues represented 27%, 26% and 28% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The proportion of our new software license revenues relative to our total revenues was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Our new software license segment’s margins have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new software license segment’s margins have been and will continue to be affected by fair value adjustments relating to the cloud software subscription obligations that we assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. We recorded adjustments to reduce obligations under our assumed cloud software subscription offerings in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud software subscription revenues as a part of our new software licenses revenues that would have been otherwise recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of $22 million in fiscal 2012. To the extent underlying cloud software subscription contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the cloud software subscription contracts over the contract periods. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews its support contracts, (2) the amount of new support contracts sold in connection 39 Table of Contents with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 43%, 42% and 49% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. The proportion of our software license updates and product support revenues relative to our total revenues was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Margins during fiscal 2012 were 87% and accounted for 72% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license update and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: • substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal; • substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our support contract base. Even if new software license revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which add to our support contract base; and • our acquisitions have increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported. We recorded adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $48 million, $80 million and $86 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. To the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are one year. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 17%, 19% and 9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. Hardware Systems Products: We provide a complete selection of hardware systems and related services including servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including public and private cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud infrastructures. Our hardware systems products consist primarily of computer server, storage and hardware-related software, including our Oracle Solaris operating system. Our hardware systems component products are designed to be “open,” or to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as Oracle Engineered Systems. 40 Table of Contents Our Oracle Engineered Systems include Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine, SPARC SuperCluster, Oracle Database Appliance and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. By combining our server and storage hardware with our software, our open, integrated products better address customer on-premise and cloud computing requirements for performance, scalability, reliability, security, ease of management and lower total cost of ownership. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers are differentiated by their reliability, security, scalability and customer environments that they target (general purpose or specialized systems). Our midsize and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications and for customers having more computationally intensive needs. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed for the most demanding mission critical enterprise environments at any scale. We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are primarily based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation and are also compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our Netra line of servers are aimed at the unique needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and network equipment providers. Rack-optimized systems and our blade product offerings combine high-density hardware architecture and system management software that OEMs find particularly useful in building their own solution architectures. Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers’ mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers. To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly, test and quality control of enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we rely on third party manufacturing partners. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. In addition, we seek to enhance hardware systems support processes that are designed to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of new hardware products. Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and operating margins that we report are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets. We have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a 41 Table of Contents number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased and the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts. All of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers’ decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems’ infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by our acquisitions and related accounting including fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $30 million, $148 million and $128 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the support periods. Services Business Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments and offers consulting services, managed cloud services and education services. Our services business, which represented 13% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011 and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010, has lower margins than our software and hardware businesses. The proportion of our services revenues relative to our total revenues was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of Sun in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Our services revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues. Our consulting line of business primarily provides services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. The amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically segmentable from the products with which they relate and are performed after the customer’s purchase of the products. Our services revenues as they relate to consulting services are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of our product revenues, in particular the new software license sales of our application products. To the extent we are able to grow our products revenues, in particular our software application product revenues, we would also generally expect to be able to eventually grow our consulting revenues. Oracle managed cloud services provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services—including deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade services—for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers, or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. We believe that our managed cloud services offerings provide our customers with greater value and choice through increased business performance, reduced risk, a predictable cost and more flexibility in terms of service in order to maximize the performance of their Oracle software and hardware products and services. Education services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission to further the adoption and usage of our software and hardware products by our customers and create opportunities to grow our products revenues. Acquisitions An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including Taleo Corporation (Taleo) and RightNow Technologies, Inc (RightNow) in fiscal 2012, 42 Table of Contents and Art Technology Group, Inc. (ATG) and Phase Forward Incorporated (Phase Forward) in fiscal 2011, among others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the Codification, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation • Allowances for Doubtful Accounts In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed the below critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: (1) software, which includes new software license revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products and fees from cloud software subscription offerings, and software license updates and product support revenues; (2) hardware systems, which includes the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers and storage products, and hardware systems support revenues; and (3) services, which includes software and hardware related services including consulting, managed cloud services and education revenues. Revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 43 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) New software license revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software and exclude revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software license revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or services arrangement. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. Revenue Recognition for Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Related Services and Cloud Software Subscription Offerings (Nonsoftware Elements) Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers and storage products. Our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverables and 44 Table of Contents other nonsoftware deliverables including hardware systems related services and cloud software subscription offerings is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware systems products, hardware systems related services revenues and cloud software subscription revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees. Hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year. Our cloud software subscription offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud software subscription offerings are recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Hardware Systems Products and Hardware Systems Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements) We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if 45 Table of Contents so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e. distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including hardware systems products, hardware systems support, new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud software subscription, consulting, managed cloud services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e. consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully 46 Table of Contents burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Our managed cloud services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying new software licenses or hardware systems products and services. Oracle managed cloud services are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from managed cloud services are recognized as services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software license revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2) where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software license revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts 47 Table of Contents from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all the other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize new software license revenues or hardware systems product revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, hardware systems product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. 48 Table of Contents We estimate the fair values of cloud software subscription, software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize new software licenses revenues related to cloud software subscription contracts in the amount of $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2012. We did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $48 million, $80 million and $86 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $30 million, $148 million and $128 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscription and hardware systems support contracts. To the extent cloud software subscription, software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the contracts’ periods, which are generally one year in duration. In connection with a business combination, we estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination. These costs are accounted for as one-time termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, 49 Table of Contents changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. Effective fiscal 2012, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments identified in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2011 or 2010. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we 50 Table of Contents believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. 51 Table of Contents Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock-based awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based upon historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of our publicly traded options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. 52 Table of Contents To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded options, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends. If the historical data that we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Taleo in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, RightNow in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, ATG in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and Phase Forward during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Sun in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and, to a lesser extent, our acquisitions of ATG in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and Phase Forward during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, we quantify the contributions of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues, software license updates and product support revenues, hardware systems products revenues (as applicable) and hardware systems support revenues (as applicable) for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date. We also are able to quantify the total incremental expenses associated with our hardware systems products and hardware systems support operating segments for fiscal 2011 in comparison to fiscal 2010. The incremental contributions of our acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments’ revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and • although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscription contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as software license updates and product support deferred revenues, new software licenses deferred revenues and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew. 53 Table of Contents Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the rates in effect on May 31, 2011, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2012 and May 31, 2011, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.25 million in fiscal 2012 (using 1.25 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.41 million in fiscal 2011 (using 1.41 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2012 results using the fiscal 2011 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, 2012 Percent Change 2011 Percent Change 2010 (Dollars in millions) Actual Constant Actual Constant Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 19,236 5% 5% $ 18,352 33% 32% $ 13,819 EMEA(1) 11,561 1% 1% 11,497 29% 28% 8,938 Asia Pacific(2) 6,324 10% 7% 5,773 42% 32% 4,063 Total revenues 37,121 4% 4% 35,622 33% 30% 26,820 Total Operating Expenses 23,415 -1% -1% 23,589 33% 31% 17,758 Total Operating Margin $ 13,706 14% 14% $ 12,033 33% 29% $ 9,062 Total Operating Margin % 37% 34% 34% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 52% 52% 52% EMEA 31% 32% 33% Asia Pacific 17% 16% 15% Total Revenues by Business: Software $ 26,116 9% 9% $ 24,031 17% 15% $ 20,625 Hardware Systems 6,302 -9% -10% 6,944 203% 195% 2,290 Services 4,703 1% 1% 4,647 19% 17% 3,905 Total revenues $ 37,121 4% 4% $ 35,622 33% 30% $ 26,820 % Revenues by Business: Software 70% 68% 77% Hardware Systems 17% 19% 9% Services 13% 13% 14% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) Asia Pacific includes Japan Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in our total revenues in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to growth in our software business’ revenues, partially offset by a reduction in our hardware systems business’ revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65%, EMEA contributed 8% and Asia Pacific contributed 27% to our total revenues growth. 54 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total operating expenses decreased slightly in fiscal 2012 primarily due to a reduction in our hardware systems business’ expenses due to efficiencies gained through our hardware systems support integration efforts and lower hardware systems products costs associated with lower hardware systems products revenues; due to decreases in certain variable compensation expenses; and due to a reduction in restructuring costs and acquisition related costs primarily associated with expenses incurred in fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of Sun. These fiscal 2012 expense decreases were partially offset by fiscal 2012 expense increases in salaries and benefits primarily related to additional sales and marketing headcount and an increase in general and administrative expenses that was due to a $120 million legal expense recovery in fiscal 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2012 was due to our increase in revenues while our expenses decreased. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Our total revenues increased in fiscal 2011 due to $4.7 billion of incremental revenue contribution from our hardware systems business and significant increases in our software and services businesses’ revenues. Our total revenues growth across all of our businesses in fiscal 2011 was favorably affected by a full year of revenue contributions from Sun as compared to our fiscal 2010 operating results, for which Sun’s revenue contributions were limited to only a portion of the fiscal 2010 period. In addition, our software business revenues increased as a result of the growth in our new software license revenues and our software license updates and product support revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 29% and APAC contributed 16% to our total revenues growth. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal 2011 was due to a full year of expense contributions from Sun to our fiscal 2011 operating results, including increased expenses pertaining to hardware systems products sold and related hardware systems support offerings, additional employee related expenses and an increase in intangible asset amortization. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in restructuring expenses relating to our Sun Restructuring Plan and certain other Oracle-based restructuring plans and were also favorably affected by the recovery of certain legal costs in fiscal 2011 as noted above. On a constant currency basis, our operating margin increased during fiscal 2011 due to our total revenues growth. Our operating margin as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2011 as our revenues and expenses grew at approximately the same rates. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. 55 Table of Contents Our operating results include the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other significant expense items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 New software licenses deferred revenues(1) $ 22 $ — $ — Software license updates and product support deferred revenues(1) 48 80 86 Hardware systems support deferred revenues(1) 30 148 128 Hardware systems products expenses(2) — — 29 Amortization of intangible assets(3) 2,430 2,428 1,973 Acquisition related and other(4)(6) 56 208 154 Restructuring(5) 295 487 622 Stock-based compensation(6) 626 500 421 Income tax effects(7) (967 ) (1,003 ) (1,054 ) $ 2,540 $ 2,848 $ 2,359 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud software subscription, software support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize new software licenses revenues related to cloud software subscription contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amount of $22 million in fiscal 2012. We also did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amounts of $48 million, $80 million and $86 million in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $30 million, $148 million and $128 million in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Approximately $34 million of estimated cloud software subscription contract revenues assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2013 that would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $13 million and $2 million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2013 and 2014, respectively, that would have otherwise been recognized by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $11 million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2013 that would have otherwise been recognized by certain acquired companies as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the contract renewal periods. (2) Represents the effects of fair value adjustments to our inventories acquired from Sun that were sold to customers in fiscal 2010. Business combination accounting rules require us to account for inventories assumed from our acquisitions at their fair values. The $29 million included in the hardware systems products expenses line in the table above for fiscal 2010, is intended to adjust these expenses to the hardware systems products expenses that would have been otherwise recorded by Sun as an independent entity upon the sale of these inventories. If we acquire inventories in future acquisitions, we will be required to assess their fair values, which may result in fair value adjustments to those inventories. (3) Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2012, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2013 $ 2,313 Fiscal 2014 1,938 Fiscal 2015 1,488 Fiscal 2016 941 Fiscal 2017 384 Thereafter 824 Total intangible assets subject to amortization 7,888 In-process research and development 11 Total intangible assets, net $ 7,899 (4) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and certain other operating expenses, net. 56 Table of Contents (5) The significant majority of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 relate to employee severance, facility exit costs and contract termination costs in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2010 primarily relate to costs incurred pursuant to our Sun Restructuring Plan and our Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (6) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2012 2011 2010 Sales and marketing $ 122 $ 87 $ 81 Software license updates and product support 18 14 17 Hardware systems products 1 2 3 Hardware systems support 5 5 2 Services 23 16 14 Research and development 295 231 172 General and administrative 162 145 132 Subtotal 626 500 421 Acquisition related and other 33 10 15 Total stock-based compensation $ 659 $ 510 $ 436 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. (7) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in an effective tax rate of 24.0% for fiscal 2012 instead of 23.0%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to the disproportionate rate impact of discrete items, income tax effects related to acquired tax exposures, and differences in jurisdictional tax rates and related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in the period. Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 25.3% for fiscal 2011 instead of 25.1%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to differences in jurisdictional tax rates and the related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in the period and the income tax effects related to our acquired tax exposures. Income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 27.1% for fiscal 2010 instead of 25.6%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to similar reasons as those noted for the fiscal 2011 differences. Software Business Our software business consists of our new software licenses segment and software license updates and product support segment. 57 Table of Contents New Software Licenses: New software license revenues substantially represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware and our application software, and also include fees earned from cloud software subscription contracts. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Expenses associated with our new software license revenues are sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software products, marketing program costs, and amortization of intangible assets.

On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 63%, EMEA contributed 13% and Asia Pacific contributed 24% to our new software license revenues growth during fiscal 2012. In constant currency, database and middleware revenues and applications revenues increased by 6% and 14%, respectively, in fiscal 2012 primarily due to growth resulting from improved customer demand for our products, our sales force’s execution and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. The growth rates of our new software license revenues for fiscal 2012 were affected by the high growth rates that we experienced in fiscal 2011 against which our fiscal 2012 revenues were compared. In reported currency, products from our recent acquisitions contributed $63 million to the growth in our database and middleware revenues and $254 million to the growth in our applications revenues during fiscal 2012. 58 Table of Contents As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud software subscription obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, cloud software subscription revenues in the amount of $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2012. To the extent underlying cloud software subscription contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the cloud software subscription contracts over the contract periods. In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 4% in fiscal 2012 and represented 27% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2012 in comparison to 28% in fiscal 2011. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our total new software license expenses increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount. Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, new software license margin increased due to the increase in revenues, and new software license margin as a percentage of revenues was flat as our revenues increased at the same rate as our operating expenses. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total new software license revenues increased by 19% in fiscal 2011 due to growth across all major regions and product types and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 63%, EMEA contributed 21% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to our new software license revenues growth during fiscal 2011. In constant currency, database and middleware revenues and applications revenues increased by 19% and 20%, respectively, in fiscal 2011 primarily due to similar reasons as those noted above. In reported currency, Sun contributed $398 million in growth to our database and middleware revenues through the third quarter of fiscal 2011 (the one year anniversary of our acquisition of Sun) and our other recent acquisitions contributed $40 million during fiscal 2011. In reported currency, our recent acquisitions contributed $191 million to the growth in our applications revenues during fiscal 2011. In reported currency, new software license revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 47% in fiscal 2011 and represented 28% of our new software license revenues in fiscal 2011 in comparison to 23% in fiscal 2010. Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher employee related and other operating expenses resulting from a full year of expense contributions from Sun to our fiscal 2011 operating results and higher variable compensation expenses resulting from higher revenues. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, new software license margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased as our revenues increased at a faster rate than our expenses. 59 Table of Contents Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from acquisitions.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 53%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 18% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2012 included incremental revenues of $83 million from our recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $48 million, $80 million and $86 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in duration. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses were flat in fiscal 2012 as an increase in intangible asset amortization and salaries expenses from increased headcount were offset by reductions in variable compensation expenses, bad debt expenses and certain other operating expenses. 60 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased while our total expenses remained flat. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2011 for similar reasons as those noted above. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2011 included incremental revenues of $240 million from Sun through the third quarter of fiscal 2011 (the one year anniversary of our acquisition) and $80 million from our other recently acquired companies. As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were affected by business combination accounting rules. On a constant currency basis, total software license updates and product support expenses increased due to an increase in salaries, variable compensation and benefits expenses that were primarily related to a full year’s contribution from Sun and certain other headcount increases. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment. Hardware Systems Products: Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our computer server and storage products. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

These hardware revenue decreases were partially offset by increases in hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems during fiscal 2012. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products operating expenses declined in fiscal 2012 primarily due to reductions in hardware systems products costs associated with lower revenues, lower intangible asset amortization, and decreases in bad debt expenses, which were partially offset by increased employee related expenses due to additional sales headcount. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreases in hardware systems products revenues and increases in hardware sales and marketing expenses. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: The increases in hardware systems products revenues, expenses and total margin for fiscal 2011 were primarily attributable to the impact of Sun’s contributions to our operating results for the full fiscal 2011 year as compared to fiscal 2010, which included Sun’s contribution to our operating results for only a portion of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2010, our hardware systems products expenses and total margin were unfavorably impacted by $29 million of fair value adjustments made pursuant to business combination accounting rules for inventories we assumed from Sun and sold to customers in the post-combination periods. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses. Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware systems and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware systems support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with hardware systems support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $30 million, $148 million and $128 million that would have been otherwise reported by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support periods. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support expenses decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the reduction of service delivery costs during fiscal 2012 resulting from our integration initiatives associated with our acquisition of Sun. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as a result of our expense reductions. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: The increases in hardware systems support revenues and expenses in fiscal 2011 were primarily attributable to the impact of Sun’s contributions to our operating results for the full fiscal 2011 period as compared to fiscal 2010. As a result of our acquisition of Sun, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition date as prescribed by business combination accounting rules that, as described above, affected the amounts of hardware systems support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses. 63 Table of Contents Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, managed cloud services and education services.

These increases were partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and certain other operating expenses, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 Actual Constant 2011 Actual Constant 2010 Transitional and other employee related costs $ 25 -81% -81% $ 129 94% 86% $ 66 Stock-based compensation 33 254% 254% 10 -37% -37% 15 Professional fees and other, net 13 -81% -83% 66 -2% -4% 68 Business combination adjustments, net (15 ) -499% -515% 3 -28% -78% 5 Total acquisition related and other expenses $ 56 -73% -74% $ 208 35% 27% $ 154 Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: On a constant currency basis, the decrease in acquisition related and other expenses during fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower transitional employee related costs and professional services expenses in comparison to those that were incurred in fiscal 2011 (primarily related to our acquisition of Sun), and was also due to a benefit from a business combination related legal settlement, which reduced our fiscal 2012 expenses. These expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses associated with our recent acquisitions and expenses associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration payable (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). 66 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased primarily due to the full fiscal year impact of Sun’s expense contributions, including higher transitional employee related expenses. Restructuring expenses: Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 Actual Constant 2011 Actual Constant 2010 Restructuring expenses $ 295 -40% -40% $ 487 -22% -23% $ 622 Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2012 primarily related to our Sun Restructuring Plan, which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to better align our cost structure as a result of our acquisition of Sun. To a lesser extent, we also incurred expenses associated with other Oracle-based plans, which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our Oracle-based operations. The decrease in restructuring expenses in fiscal 2012 in comparison to those that were incurred in fiscal 2011 primarily related to the decrease in expenses incurred in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: During fiscal 2011, we incurred restructuring expenses primarily in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan and to a lesser extent, we also incurred expenses associated with other Oracle-based plans. During fiscal 2010, we recorded restructuring expenses primarily in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan and our Fiscal 2009 Oracle Restructuring Plan. Interest Expense: Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 Actual Constant 2011 Actual Constant 2010 Interest expense $ 766 -5% -5% $ 808 7% 7% $ 754 Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2012 due to lower average borrowings as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the maturity and repayment of $2.25 billion of senior notes in January 2011. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2011 due to higher average borrowings resulting primarily from our issuance of $3.25 billion of senior notes in July 2010. This interest expense increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with the maturities and repayments of $2.25 billion of senior notes, as noted above, and $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and related variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements in May 2010. Non-Operating Income (Expense), net: Non-operating income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses) including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 Actual Constant 2011 Actual Constant 2010 Interest income $ 231 42% 45% $ 163 34% 32% $ 122 Foreign currency gains (losses), net (105 ) -1,041% -1,112% 11 108% 112% (148 ) Noncontrolling interests in income (119 ) 23% 25% (97 ) -2% -1% (95 ) Other income, net 15 -86% -86% 109 92% 89% 56 Total non-operating income (expense), net $ 22 -88% -83% $ 186 388% 372% $ (65 ) 67 Table of Contents Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of net foreign currency transaction losses incurred in fiscal 2012 in comparison to net foreign currency transaction gains incurred in fiscal 2011. In addition, we incurred a decrease in other income, net, which was attributable to net gains recorded in fiscal 2011 due to favorable changes in the values of our marketable securities that we classify as trading that are held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations. These unfavorable variations to non-operating income, net were partially offset by increases in interest income during fiscal 2012 due to larger average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in comparison to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: We recorded non-operating income, net during fiscal 2011 in comparison to non-operating expense, net in fiscal 2010 primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses incurred in fiscal 2010, which included a foreign currency remeasurement loss of $81 million resulting from the designation of our Venezuelan subsidiary as “highly inflationary” in accordance with the FASB’s ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, and the subsequent devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by the Venezuelan government. In addition, our interest income increased in fiscal 2011 due to larger average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and other income, net increased in fiscal 2011 as a result of gains recognized on the sale of certain equity investments. Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 Actual Constant 2011 Actual Constant 2010 Provision for income taxes $ 2,981 4% 4% $ 2,864 36% 32% $ 2,108 Effective tax rate 23.0% 25.1% 25.6% Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Provision for income taxes increased during fiscal 2012 due substantially to higher income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by the favorable effects of an increase in the number of foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower statutory rates than the United States, the earnings of which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. If these subsidiaries generate sufficient earnings in the future, our provision for income taxes may continue to be favorably affected to a meaningful extent, although any such favorable effects could be significantly reduced under a variety of circumstances. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Provision for income taxes increased during fiscal 2011 due substantially to higher income before provision for income taxes and a reduction in the impact of favorable judicial decisions and settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010 Working capital $ 24,635 -1% $ 24,982 103% $ 12,313 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 30,676 6% $ 28,848 56% $ 18,469 Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2012 in comparison to May 31, 2011 was primarily due to an increase in our stock repurchases during fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 (we used $5.9 billion of cash for stock repurchases during fiscal 2012 in comparison to $1.2 billion used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2011), the reclassification of $1.25 billion of our senior notes due April 2013 as a 68 Table of Contents current liability, cash used for acquisitions and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders. These decreases to working capital were almost entirely offset by the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2012. Our working capital may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are variable. The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2011 in comparison to May 31, 2010 was primarily due to the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2011 and our issuance of $3.25 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2010. These increases were partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2012 in comparison to May 31, 2011 was primarily due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities and our short-term borrowing of $1.7 billion made pursuant to a revolving credit agreement. These increases in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by our June 2011 repayment of $1.15 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to our expired revolving credit facilities, $255 million of cash used to repay RightNow’s legacy convertible notes after the closing of the acquisition, the use of $4.7 billion of net cash for acquisitions, the repurchases of our common stock (see discussion above) and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $26.8 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2012, $20.9 billion of which we consider indefinitely reinvested earnings outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $6.3 billion as of May 31, 2012. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against major international currencies during fiscal 2012, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased as of May 31, 2012 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates as of May 31, 2011. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2011 in comparison to May 31, 2010 was primarily due to cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of $3.25 billion of senior notes in July 2010 and $1.15 billion of short-term borrowings made pursuant to certain of our revolving credit agreements. Additionally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to certain major international currencies during fiscal 2011. These increases in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were partially offset by the repayment of $2.25 billion of our senior notes which matured in January 2011, the repayment of $881 million of commercial paper notes, the usage of $1.9 billion of net cash for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and the payments of cash dividends to our stockholders. Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 53 days at May 31, 2012 compared with 55 days at May 31, 2011. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the revenue adjustments that primarily reduce our acquired cloud software subscription, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,743 23% $ 11,214 29% $ 8,681 Net cash used for investing activities $ (8,381 ) 38% $ (6,081 ) -41% $ (10,319 ) Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (6,099 ) 1,282% $ 516 81% $ 2,664 69 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software license sales, sales of hardware systems products and hardware systems support arrangements and, to a lesser extent, services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation, an increase in cash from the collection of trade receivables, an increase in cash received that relates to our deferred revenue balances, a decrease in cash used to pay income tax obligations and certain other net cash favorable working capital movements, in each case compared to fiscal 2011. These cash favorable movements were partially offset by an increase in cash used to pay compensation liabilities in fiscal 2012 such as commissions and bonuses in comparison to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation. These fiscal 2011 increases were partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital, primarily increases in net trade receivables resulting from increases in revenues during our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 in comparison to fiscal 2010. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2012 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities). Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2011 due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and a decrease in cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities), partially offset by an increase in net capital expenditures. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt facilities as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: We used net cash for financing activities in fiscal 2012 of $6.1 billion in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 of $516 million primarily due to our increase in common stock repurchases in fiscal 2012 (see discussion in “Working Capital” above and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), a reduction in the amount of debt that we issued in fiscal 2012 ($1.7 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility in May 2012 in comparison to $3.25 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2010 and $1.15 billion of borrowings pursuant to revolving credit facilities in May 2011), and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2012, in each case in comparison to fiscal 2011. These unfavorable impacts to our financing cash flows during fiscal 2012 were partially offset by a decrease in cash used for debt related repayments during fiscal 2012 ($1.15 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facilities and $255 million of RightNow’s legacy convertible notes were repaid in February 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 repayments of $2.25 billion of senior notes and $881 million of commercial paper notes). 70 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 decreased due to a reduction in the amount of debt that we issued in fiscal 2011 ($1.15 billion borrowed pursuant to our revolving credit facilities and $3.25 billion of long-term senior notes issued) in comparison to fiscal 2010 ($4.5 billion of long-term senior notes and $2.8 billion of commercial paper notes issued). This unfavorable impact to our financing cash flows was partially offset by a cash favorable reduction in debt repayments during fiscal 2011 (repayments of $2.25 billion of senior notes in January 2011 and $881 million of commercial paper notes) in comparison to fiscal 2010 (repayments of $1.9 billion of commercial paper notes, $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and $700 million of Sun’s legacy convertible notes) and an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2011. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,743 23% $ 11,214 29% $ 8,681 Capital expenditures(1) (648 ) 44% (450 ) 96% (230 ) Free cash flow $ 13,095 22% $ 10,764 27% $ 8,451 Net income $ 9,981 $ 8,547 39% $ 6,135 Free cash flow as percent of net income 131% 126% 138% (1) Represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. We financed $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, or approximately 16% of our new software license revenues in each of fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, and $134 million and $117 million, respectively, or approximately 3% of our hardware systems products revenues in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011. Recent Financing Activities: Revolving Credit Agreement: On May 29, 2012, we borrowed $1.7 billion pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent; and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner (the 2012 Credit Agreement). Interest for the 2012 Credit Agreement is based on either (x) a “base rate” calculated as the highest of (i) JPMorgan’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the LIBOR for deposits in U.S. Dollars plus 1%, or (y) LIBOR for deposits made in U.S. Dollars plus 0.35%, depending on the type of borrowings made by us. This borrowing is due on July 2, 2012, which is the termination date of the 2012 Credit Agreement. Additional details regarding the 2012 Credit Agreement are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. On June 30, 2011, our revolving credit agreements with BNP Paribas, as initial lender and administrative agent, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner (the 2011 Credit Agreements), to borrow $1.15 billion were repaid in full and the 2011 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms. RightNow Convertible Notes: Subsequent to the closing of our acquisition of RightNow, we repaid, in full, $255 million of RightNow’s legacy convertible notes during the third quarter of fiscal 2012. 71 Table of Contents Senior Notes: As of May 31, 2012 and May 31, 2011, we had $14.8 billion of senior notes outstanding of which $1.3 billion matures and is payable in fiscal 2013. In accordance with our obligations under a registration rights agreement entered into in July 2010 in connection with the original issuance of our $3.25 billion of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $1.0 billion of 3.875% notes due July 2020 (2020 Notes) and $2.25 billion of 5.375% notes due July 2040 (2040 Notes, and together with the 2020 Notes, the Original Senior Notes), on December 16, 2011 we completed a registered offer to exchange the Original Senior Notes for new freely tradable notes having terms substantially identical to the Original Senior Notes. An aggregate of $994 million principal amount of the 2020 Notes and an aggregate of $2.24 billion principal amount of the 2040 Notes were tendered and exchanged in the offer. Additional details regarding these senior notes and all other borrowings are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On December 20, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion. On June 18, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a further expansion by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2012, approximately $3.1 billion remained available for stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program prior to the June 2012 additional amount authorized. We repurchased 207.3 million shares for $6.0 billion, 40.4 million shares for $1.2 billion and 43.3 million shares for $1.0 billion in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend repayments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2012, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.24 per share that totaled $1.2 billion. In June 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock payable on August 3, 2012 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 13, 2012. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. 72 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2012: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 16,450 $ 2,950 $ — $ 1,500 $ 2,000 $ — $ 10,000 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 10,063 738 676 665 655 550 6,779 Operating leases(2) 1,535 406 307 227 172 129 294 Purchase obligations and other(3) 579 523 49 4 3 — — Total contractual obligations $ 28,627 $ 4,617 $ 1,032 $ 2,396 $ 2,830 $ 679 $ 17,073 (1) Our total borrowings consisted of the following as of May 31, 2012 (dollars in millions): Amount Short-term borrowings (effective interest rate of 0.24%) $ 1,700 4.95% senior notes due April 2013 1,250 3.75% senior notes due July 2014, including fair value adjustment of $69 1,569 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $4 1,996 5.75% senior notes due April 2018, net of discount of $1 2,499 5.00% senior notes due July 2019, net of discount of $5 1,745 3.875% senior notes due July 2020, net of discount of $2 998 6.50% senior notes due April 2038, net of discount of $2 1,248 6.125% senior notes due July 2039, net of discount of $8 1,242 5.375% senior notes due July 2040, net of discount of $24 2,226 Total borrowings $ 16,473 We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our July 2014 senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on the July 2014 senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using an interest rate of 1.39%, which represented our effective interest rate as of May 31, 2012 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods. The changes in fair value of our debt associated with the interest rate risk that we are hedging pursuant to these agreements are included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of borrowings. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $249 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2012. (3) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in this amount as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. As of May 31, 2012, we had $4.0 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant taxing authorities to pay approximately $47.5 million of these liabilities. Although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made, some or all may be made in fiscal 2013. 73 Table of Contents We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2013. As described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we have contingent consideration payable as a result of our acquisition of Pillar Data Systems, Inc. that will settle in fiscal 2015. Subsequent to fiscal 2012, we agreed to acquire certain companies for amounts that are not material to our business. We expect to close such acquisitions within the next twelve months. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short-term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2013. The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2012 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 29 May 31 Revenues $ 8,374 $ 8,792 $ 9,039 $ 10,916 Gross profit $ 6,339 $ 6,792 $ 7,088 $ 8,853 Operating income $ 2,683 $ 3,111 $ 3,317 $ 4,596 Net income $ 1,840 $ 2,192 $ 2,498 $ 3,451 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.36 $ 0.43 $ 0.50 $ 0.70 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.43 $ 0.49 $ 0.69 Fiscal 2011 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 7,502 $ 8,582 $ 8,764 $ 10,775 Gross profit $ 5,401 $ 6,384 $ 6,707 $ 8,544 Operating income $ 1,917 $ 2,770 $ 2,987 $ 4,359 Net income $ 1,352 $ 1,870 $ 2,116 $ 3,209 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.27 $ 0.37 $ 0.42 $ 0.63 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.27 $ 0.37 $ 0.41 $ 0.62 74 Table of Contents Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We historically have granted only stock options to our employees and any restricted stock-based awards outstanding were assumed as a result of our acquisitions. We recognize that options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2009 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Some of the outstanding options, which generally have a 10 year exercise period, have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. At May 31, 2012, 28.0% of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2012, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 8.7%. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants of up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option and restricted stock-based award activity from June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2012 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2009 359 Options granted 294 Options and restricted stock-based awards assumed 43 Options exercised and restricted stock-based awards vested (183 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (88 ) Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2012 425 Weighted average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations. 83 Weighted average annualized stock repurchases (97 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2012 4,905 Basic weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2012 5,026 Options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2012 8.7% In the money options and total restricted stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal period presented) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2012 6.2% Weighted average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2012 1.7% Weighted average annualized options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2012 -0.3% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to certain employees. These annual option grants are made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. 75 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large, diverse financial institutions worldwide, which we believe mitigates certain risks. In addition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, all of which have maturity dates, if any, within two years from the date of purchase (see a description of our debt securities held in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2012, total interest income was $231 million with our investments yielding an average 0.72% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the fair values of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2012 and 2011. May 31, 2012 2011 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value WeightedAverageInterestRate Fair Value WeightedAverageInterestRate Cash and cash equivalents $ 14,955 0.61% $ 16,163 0.61% Marketable securities 15,721 0.80% 12,685 0.68% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 30,676 0.71% $ 28,848 0.64% Interest Expense Risk Our total borrowings were $16.5 billion as of May 31, 2012, all of which were fixed rate borrowings. Future changes in interest rates and resulting changes in estimated fair values of our borrowings other than our senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) and short-term borrowings pursuant to our 2012 Credit Agreement would not impact the interest expense we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. We have entered into certain fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate and related fair value of our 2014 Notes so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes. We have designated these swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair value of our fixed rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings. The periodic interest settlements for the swap agreements, which occur at the same interval as those per the 2014 Notes, are recorded as interest expense. By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Our 2014 Notes had an effective interest rate of 1.39% as of May 31, 2012, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. Changes in the overall level of 76 Table of Contents interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2012, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately $15 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for a net unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $873 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2012 and 2011. Net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) included in non-operating income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $(105) million, $11 million and $(149) million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2010 were foreign currency losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations, which are more thoroughly described under “Non-Operating Income (Expense), net” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which may vary. Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet). Periodically, we may hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure. As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2012, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries as of May 31, 2012 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2011. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on 77 Table of Contents our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was a (decrease) increase of $(471) million, $600 million and $(107) million, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of May 31, 2012: (in millions) U.S. DollarEquivalent atMay 31, 2012 Euro $ 1,302 Chinese Renminbi 930 Indian Rupee 814 Japanese Yen 760 Australian Dollar 712 South African Rand 329 Canadian Dollar 259 British Pound 258 Other foreign currencies 2,002 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 7,366 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $737 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances.",2023-12-30 16:56:35.153638
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview We are the world’s largest provider of enterprise software and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services that are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud computing, including database and middleware as well as web-based applications, virtualization, clustering and large-scale systems management. We provide cloud services as well as software and hardware products to other cloud service providers, both public and private. Oracle database and middleware software, applications software and hardware systems—including computer server, storage and networking products—are the building blocks of our own cloud services, our partners’ cloud services and our customers’ private cloud environments. Our customers can subscribe to use select Oracle software and hardware products through our cloud offerings, or purchase our software and hardware products and related services to build their own private cloud or on-premise information technology (IT) environments. Our strategy is to deliver reliable and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work together or independently. We also pursue new or emerging growth opportunities in order to maintain technology leadership. Offering customers a choice in how they use our products and services—while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security, and interoperability—is important to our corporate strategy. We believe that internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans. In fiscal 2013, we invested $4.9 billion, and in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011 we invested $4.5 billion, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. We continue to focus the engineering of our hardware and software products to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance, reliability and security to our customers. For example, Oracle Engineered Systems, which include our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SPARC SuperCluster products, among others, combine certain of our hardware and software offerings in a way that increases computing performance relative to our competitors’ products, creating time savings, efficiencies and operational cost advantages for our customers. With products that are engineered to work together, our customers can reduce much of the complexity of IT and make available resources they would otherwise spend on IT operations. In addition to our introductions of new, innovative hardware and software products, we also continue to demonstrate our commitment to customer choice through ongoing enhancements to our existing products, including our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards applications software products. We believe that an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy as it enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. We are organized into three businesses—software, hardware systems and services—which are further divided into certain operating segments. Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows. Software Business Our software business, which represented 74%, 70% and 68% of our total revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions and (2) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software business’ total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and subscription offerings, our software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development. 33 Table of Contents New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions: We license our database and middleware, as well as our applications software, and provide access to a broad range of our software offerings through cloud software subscriptions contracts. Our software solutions are built on a standards-based, integrated architecture that is designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure. Our software products are designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third party UNIX products, among others. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit their needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. The growth in new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software licenses transactions is characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues. Since our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions, we believe that analysis of new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues on a trailing 4-quarter period (as provided in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q) provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of this business segment. New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues represented 28%, 27% and 26% of our total revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our cloud software subscriptions contracts are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment’s margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment’s margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud software subscriptions obligations that we assumed in our business combinations (described further below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. For certain of our acquired businesses, we recorded adjustments to reduce cloud software subscriptions obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud software subscriptions revenues related to cloud software subscriptions contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $45 million and $22 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud software subscriptions contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud software subscriptions contracts over their respective contractual periods. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2) the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 46%, 43% and 42% of our total revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Our software support margins during fiscal 2013 were 88% and accounted for 74% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: • substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal; • substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses 34 Table of Contents revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which add to our software support contract base; and • our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported. We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $14 million, $48 million and $80 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. To the extent underlying software support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the software support contracts over the respective support periods, the majority of which are one year. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 14%, 17% and 19% of our total revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. Hardware Systems Products: We provide a broad selection of hardware systems and related services including servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including public and private cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the world’s largest public and private clouds, including the Oracle Cloud; our software development private cloud; and our Oracle University self-service private cloud. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as Oracle Engineered Systems. Oracle Engineered Systems are core building blocks for Oracle’s data center and cloud computing products and services. Oracle Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), an on-premise cloud offering for deploying Oracle’s Engineered Systems to customers on a subscription basis, provides our customers with flexibility in deployment models and allows our customers to cost effectively handle peak computing workloads with capacity on demand. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle SPARC SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation (Intel) and are also compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 systems are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers’ mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, flash and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments. Our networking and data center fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers. 35 Table of Contents To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and hardware systems operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets. We have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware systems support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of sale, and the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts. All of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers’ decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems’ infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting including fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $14 million, $30 million and $148 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the respective support periods. Services Business Our services business is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments and offers consulting services, managed cloud services and education services. Our services business, which represented 12% of our total revenues in fiscal 2013 and 13% in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011, has lower margins than our software and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues. Our consulting line of business is designed to help our customers more successfully architect and deploy our products. Our consulting services include business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. The amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically segmentable from the products to which they relate and are performed after the customer’s purchase of the products. Our services revenues as they relate to consulting services are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level 36 Table of Contents of our product revenues, in particular the new software licenses sales of our application products. To the extent we are able to grow our products revenues, in particular our software application product revenues, we would also generally expect to be able to eventually grow our consulting revenues. Oracle managed cloud services provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services—including deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade services—for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. We believe that our managed cloud services offerings provide our customers with greater value and choice through increased business performance, reduced risk, a predictable cost and more flexibility in terms of service in order to maximize the performance of their Oracle software and hardware products and services. Education services provide training to customers, partners and employees as a part of our mission of accelerating the adoption and use of our software and hardware products and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues. Acquisitions An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet) in fiscal 2013, and Taleo Corporation (Taleo) and RightNow Technologies, Inc. (RightNow) in fiscal 2012, among others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our pending and recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAP, as set forth within the Codification, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation • Allowances for Doubtful Accounts 37 Table of Contents In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: (1) software, which includes new software licenses revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products and fees from cloud software subscriptions offerings, and software license updates and product support revenues; (2) hardware systems, which includes the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers, storage products, networking and data center fabric products, and fees from infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings, and hardware systems support revenues; and (3) services, which includes software and hardware related services including consulting, managed cloud services and education revenues. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and applications software and exclude cloud software subscriptions revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered 38 Table of Contents elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or services arrangement. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. Revenue Recognition for Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Related Services, Cloud Software Subscriptions and IaaS Offerings (Nonsoftware Elements) Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers, storage and networking products. Our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverables and other nonsoftware deliverables including hardware systems related services and cloud software subscriptions offerings is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware systems products revenues, hardware systems related services revenues and cloud software subscriptions revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees. Hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year. Our cloud software subscriptions offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud software subscriptions offerings are recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Our IaaS offerings are on-premise cloud offerings for deploying certain of Oracle’s Engineered Systems and support services to customers on a subscription basis. Customers that enter into IaaS arrangements are also able to purchase additional capacity on demand. Our revenue recognition policy for IaaS offerings is in accordance with ASC 605 and ASC 840, Leases. Substantially all of our IaaS offerings are accounted for as operating leases as our contracts are structured so that the term of the arrangement is less than 75% of the economic life of the equipment and the present value of the minimum fixed payments are less than 90% of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the arrangement. Our evaluation of useful life is based on our historical product development cycles and our historical customer hardware upgrade cycles. Capacity on demand is a contingent payment and is therefore excluded from our assessment of the net present value of fixed payments. Revenue for capacity on demand is recognized in the period our customers access additional capacity provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Hardware Systems Products and Hardware Systems Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements) We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of 39 Table of Contents accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e. distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including hardware systems products, hardware systems support, new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud software subscriptions and IaaS offerings, consulting, managed cloud services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e. consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If 40 Table of Contents there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Our managed cloud services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying new software licenses or hardware systems products and services. Oracle managed cloud services are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from managed cloud services are recognized as services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2) where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the 41 Table of Contents proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all the other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize new software licenses revenues or hardware systems product revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud software subscriptions contracts, hardware systems product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We estimate the fair values of cloud software subscriptions, software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated 42 Table of Contents with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize cloud software subscriptions revenues related to cloud software subscriptions contracts in the amount of $45 million and $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. We did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $14 million, $48 million and $80 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $14 million, $30 million and $148 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscriptions and hardware systems support contracts. To the extent cloud software subscriptions, software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the contracts’ periods, which are generally one year in duration. In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. Effective fiscal 2012, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the 43 Table of Contents reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed on March 1, 2013, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2012 or 2011. Our consulting and hardware systems products reporting units have experienced revenues and operating margin declines in fiscal 2013 as compared to prior years. As a result, our consulting and hardware systems products reporting units may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for these reporting units differ from our projections. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be 44 Table of Contents adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock-based awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future 45 Table of Contents forfeitures based upon historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon U.S. treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of publicly traded options in our stock in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of publicly traded options in our stock, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends. If the historical data that we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, Taleo in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and RightNow during the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Taleo in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, RightNow in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Art Technology Group, Inc. (ATG) in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and Phase Forward Incorporated (Phase Forward) during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, we quantify the contributions of our acquired products to the growth in new software licenses and cloud software 46 Table of Contents subscriptions revenues and software license updates and product support revenues for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date. The incremental contributions of our acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments’ revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as the quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and • although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscriptions contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions deferred revenues, software license updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the rates in effect on May 31, 2012, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.29 million in fiscal 2013 (using 1.29 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.25 million in fiscal 2012 (using 1.25 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2013 results using the fiscal 2012 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 47 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, 2013 Percent Change 2012 Percent Change 2011 (Dollars in millions) Actual Constant Actual Constant Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 19,719 3% 3% $ 19,236 5% 5% $ 18,352 EMEA(1) 11,158 -3% 0% 11,561 1% 1% 11,497 Asia Pacific(2) 6,303 0% 3% 6,324 10% 7% 5,773 Total revenues 37,180 0% 2% 37,121 4% 4% 35,622 Total Operating Expenses 22,496 -4% -2% 23,415 -1% -1% 23,589 Total Operating Margin $ 14,684 7% 10% $ 13,706 14% 14% $ 12,033 Total Operating Margin % 39% 37% 34% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 53% 52% 52% EMEA 30% 31% 32% Asia Pacific 17% 17% 16% Total Revenues by Business: Software $ 27,463 5% 7% $ 26,116 9% 9% $ 24,031 Hardware Systems 5,346 -15% -13% 6,302 -9% -10% 6,944 Services 4,371 -7% -5% 4,703 1% 1% 4,647 Total revenues $ 37,180 0% 2% $ 37,121 4% 4% $ 35,622 % Revenues by Business: Software 74% 70% 68% Hardware Systems 14% 17% 19% Services 12% 13% 13% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) Asia Pacific includes Japan Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2013 due to an increase in our software business revenues, which was attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues. This constant currency increase was partially offset by reductions in our hardware systems and services business’ revenues. On a constant currency basis, the Americas region contributed 77% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 23% to our growth in total revenues during fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, total operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a $387 million acquisition related benefit (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), a $306 million benefit related to certain litigation (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), lower hardware systems products costs associated with lower hardware systems products revenues, and certain other operating expense decreases in most of our other lines of business primarily due to lower variable compensation expenses, lower external contractor expenses and lower amortization of intangible assets. In constant currency, these total expense decreases during fiscal 2013 were partially offset by higher salary and benefit expenses due primarily to additional sales and marketing and research and development headcount added during fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating margin and our total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our total revenues and the decrease in our total operating expenses. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in our total revenues in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to growth in our software business’ revenues, partially offset by a reduction in 48 Table of Contents our hardware systems business’ revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65%, EMEA contributed 8% and Asia Pacific contributed 27% to our total revenues growth in fiscal 2012. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total operating expenses decreased slightly in fiscal 2012 primarily due to reductions in our hardware systems business’ expenses due to efficiencies gained through our hardware systems support integration efforts and lower hardware systems products costs associated with lower hardware systems products revenues; decreases in certain variable compensation expenses; and a reduction in restructuring costs and acquisition related costs primarily associated with expenses incurred in fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc (Sun). These fiscal 2012 expense decreases were partially offset by fiscal 2012 expense increases in salaries and benefits primarily related to additional sales and marketing headcount and an increase in general and administrative expenses that was primarily due to a $120 million legal expense recovery in fiscal 2011. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, the increase in total operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2012 was due to our increase in total revenues while our total expenses decreased. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other significant expense and income items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions deferred revenues(1) $ 45 $ 22 $ — Software license updates and product support deferred revenues(1) 14 48 80 Hardware systems support deferred revenues(1) 14 30 148 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 2,385 2,430 2,428 Acquisition related and other(3)(5) (604 ) 56 208 Restructuring(4) 352 295 487 Stock-based compensation(5) 722 626 500 Income tax effects(6) (896 ) (967 ) (1,003 ) $ 2,032 $ 2,540 $ 2,848 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud software subscriptions, software support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud software subscriptions revenues related to contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $45 million and $22 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. We also did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $14 million, $48 million and $80 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $14 million, $30 million and $148 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Approximately $6 million of estimated cloud software subscriptions revenues related to contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2014 that would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $6 million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2014 that would have otherwise been recognized by certain acquired companies as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. 49 Table of Contents (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2013, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2014 $ 2,123 Fiscal 2015 1,656 Fiscal 2016 1,094 Fiscal 2017 523 Fiscal 2018 397 Thereafter 802 Total intangible assets subject to amortization 6,595 In-process research and development 45 Total intangible assets, net $ 6,640 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable and certain other operating items, net. In fiscal 2013, acquisition related and other expenses included a benefit of $306 million related to certain litigation (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), and a net benefit of $387 million due to an acquisition related item (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). (4) The significant majority of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2013 related to employee severance and facility exit costs in connection with our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan (the 2013 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2012 and 2011 primarily related to costs incurred pursuant to our Sun Restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (5) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2013 2012 2011 Sales and marketing $ 147 $ 122 $ 87 Software license updates and product support 20 18 14 Hardware systems products 3 1 2 Hardware systems support 5 5 5 Services 31 23 16 Research and development 352 295 231 General and administrative 164 162 145 Subtotal 722 626 500 Acquisition related and other 33 33 10 Total stock-based compensation $ 755 $ 659 $ 510 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. (6) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects for fiscal 2013 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.0%, instead of 21.4% which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effect of amortization of intangible assets. Income tax effects for fiscal 2012 were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 24.0%, instead of 23.0% which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to the disproportionate rate impact of certain discrete items, income tax effects related to our acquired tax exposures, and differences in jurisdictional tax rates and related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in the period. Income tax effects for fiscal 2011 were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 25.3%, instead of 25.1% which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to differences in jurisdictional tax rates and the related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in the period and the income tax effects related to our acquired tax exposures. Software Business Our software business consists of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment and software license updates and product support segment. 50 Table of Contents New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions: New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware and our application software products. Cloud software subscriptions revenues represent fees earned from granting customers access to a broad range of our software offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment that includes access, hosting, infrastructure management, the use of software updates, and support. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Expenses associated with our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues are included in sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software offerings, marketing program costs, the cost of providing cloud software subscriptions services and amortization of intangible assets.

On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 69%, EMEA contributed 23% and Asia Pacific contributed 8% to the increase in new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues during fiscal 2013. In reported currency, our new software licenses revenues were $9.4 billion and $9.5 billion in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. In reported currency, our cloud software subscriptions revenues were $910 million and $455 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. In constant currency, our new software licenses revenues and our cloud software subscriptions revenues increased by 1% and 100%, respectively, in fiscal 2013 primarily due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. In reported currency, our recent acquisitions contributed $476 million of growth to our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues during fiscal 2013. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud software subscriptions obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, cloud software subscriptions revenues in the amounts of $45 million and $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud software subscriptions contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud software subscriptions contracts over the respective contractual periods. 51 Table of Contents In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 11% in fiscal 2013 and represented 29% of our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in fiscal 2013 in comparison to 27% in fiscal 2012. Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 2 percentage points, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to higher employee related expenses and stock-based compensation from increased headcount, and higher intangible asset amortization, partially offset by a decrease in certain legal costs. Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues for this operating segment. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased in fiscal 2012 due to growth across all major regions and product types and due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 63%, EMEA contributed 13%, and Asia Pacific contributed 24% to our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues growth during fiscal 2012. In reported currency, our new software licenses revenues were $9.5 billion and $9.0 billion in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. In reported currency, our cloud software subscriptions revenues were $455 million and $255 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. In constant currency, new software licenses revenues and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to improved customer demand for our products, our sales force’s execution and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. In reported currency, our recent acquisitions contributed $317 million of growth to our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues during fiscal 2012. As described above, the amount of new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2012 was affected by business combination accounting rules. In reported currency, new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 4% in fiscal 2012 and represented 27% of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in fiscal 2012 in comparison to 28% in fiscal 2011. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount. Excluding the effect of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions total margin increased due to the increase in revenues, and new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin as a percentage of revenues was flat as our revenues increased at the same rate as our operating expenses. 52 Table of Contents Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from acquisitions.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 56%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 15% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2013 included incremental revenues of $49 million from our recently acquired companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed software support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts in the amounts of $14 million, $48 million and $80 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the respective support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in duration. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses decreased primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets, a reduction in certain non-income based taxes, lower bad debt expenses, and lower variable compensation expenses. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased as our total revenues for this segment increased while our total expenses decreased. 53 Table of Contents Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2012 for similar reasons as those noted above for our fiscal 2013 revenues increase. In reported currency, software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal 2012 included incremental revenues of $83 million from our recently acquired companies. As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were affected by business combination accounting rules. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses were flat in fiscal 2012 as an increase in intangible asset amortization and increased salaries expenses from increased headcount were offset by reductions in variable compensation expenses, bad debt expenses and certain other operating expenses. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2012 as our total revenues increased while our total expenses remained flat. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment. Hardware Systems Products: Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our computer server, storage and networking products, including sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products operating expenses declined in fiscal 2012 primarily due to reductions in hardware systems products costs associated with lower revenues, lower intangible asset amortization, and decreases in bad debt expenses, which were partially offset by increased employee related expenses. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the decrease in hardware systems products revenues and increase in hardware sales and marketing expenses. Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware systems support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with hardware systems support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $14 million, $30 million and $148 million that would have been otherwise reported by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 55 Table of Contents 2011, respectively. To the extent these underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support periods. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a reduction in employee related expenses attributable to decreased headcount, reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives, lower bad debt expenses, and lower amortization of intangible assets. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2013 due to the reduction in our total hardware systems support expenses. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems support revenues decreased in fiscal 2012 for similar reasons as those noted above for our fiscal 2013 revenues decreases. Regionally, revenue decreases in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by higher revenues in the Americas. As described above, the amounts of hardware systems support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were affected by business combination accounting rules. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support expenses decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the reduction of service delivery costs during fiscal 2012 resulting from our integration initiatives associated with our acquisition of Sun. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2012 as a result of our expense reductions for this segment. Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, managed cloud services and education services. Consulting revenues are earned by providing services to customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. Managed cloud services revenues are earned by providing comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services—including deployment, management, monitoring, patching, security and upgrade services—for customers hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Additionally, we provide support services, both on-premise and remote, to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Education revenues are earned by providing instructor-led, media-based, internet-based and custom training in the use of our software and hardware products. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

The largest services revenues decrease in fiscal 2013 was to our consulting segment’s revenues, which were primarily impacted by weaker demand in EMEA due to weaker economic conditions and which also experienced higher revenues in the Asia Pacific region. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total services expenses decreased during fiscal 2013 primarily due to expense decreases across all of our services segments, which consisted primarily of decreases in external contractor costs, lower variable compensation expenses, and lower intangible asset amortization. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased during fiscal 2013 as our total services revenues declined at a faster rate than our total services expenses. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our services revenues increased modestly in fiscal 2012 due to increased revenues from our consulting and managed cloud services segments including incremental contributions from our recently acquired companies, which were partially offset by decreases in our education revenues. On a constant currency basis, our services expenses decreased during fiscal 2012 due to lower third-party contractor expenses associated with our managed cloud services offerings, lower intangible asset amortization and certain other net expense reductions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2012 as our total services revenues increased while our total services expenses decreased.

These decreases were partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we recently acquired in connection with our acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Acme Packet in fiscal 2013, and RightNow and Taleo in fiscal 2012, among others. Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 was flat as additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired from our acquisitions of RightNow and Taleo in fiscal 2012 and from our acquisitions of ATG and Phase Forward in fiscal 2011, among others, were offset by a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: On a constant currency basis, the decrease in acquisition related and other expenses during fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower transitional employee related costs and professional services expenses in comparison to those that were incurred in fiscal 2011 (primarily related to our acquisition of Sun), and was also due to a benefit from a business combination related legal settlement, which reduced our fiscal 2012 expenses. These expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses associated with our recent acquisitions and expenses associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration payable during fiscal 2012. Restructuring expenses: Restructuring expenses result from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

We amended the 2013 Restructuring Plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 to reflect additional actions that we expect to take to improve efficiencies in our operations. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2013 Restructuring Plan are $420 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. The total estimated remaining restructuring costs associated with the 2013 Restructuring Plan were approximately $95 million as of May 31, 2013. The majority of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2014. Our estimated costs may be subject to change in future periods. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2012 primarily related to our Sun Restructuring Plan, which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to better align our cost structure as a result of our acquisition of Sun. The decrease in restructuring expenses in fiscal 2012 in comparison to those that were incurred in fiscal 2011 primarily related to the decrease in expenses incurred in connection with our Sun Restructuring Plan.

During our third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and we recognized a $64 million foreign currency loss as a result of the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future including additional foreign currency losses related to our Venezuelan subsidiary if the Venezuelan government further devalues the Venezuelan currency, the amounts and timing of which are uncertain. This decrease in non-operating income, net was partially offset by an increase in other income, net during fiscal 2013, which was primarily due to gains from our marketable securities that we designated as trading that were held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net decreased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of net foreign currency transaction losses incurred in fiscal 2012 in comparison to net foreign currency transaction gains incurred in fiscal 2011. In addition, we incurred a decrease in other income, net, during fiscal 2012 which was attributable to net gains that we recorded in fiscal 2011 due to favorable changes in the values of our marketable securities that we classified as trading that were held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations. These unfavorable variations to non-operating income, net in fiscal 2012 were partially offset by increases in interest income during fiscal 2012 due to larger average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in comparison to fiscal 2011. Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Provision for income taxes increased during fiscal 2012 due substantially to higher income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by the favorable effects of an increase in the number of foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower statutory rates than the United States, the earnings of which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 60 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Working capital $ 28,820 17% $ 24,635 -1% $ 24,982 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 32,216 5% $ 30,676 6% $ 28,848 Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2013 in comparison to May 31, 2012 was primarily due to our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2013, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. This increase was partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock (we used $11.0 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2013), cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions. Our working capital may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2012 in comparison to May 31, 2011 was primarily due to an increase in our stock repurchases during fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011, the reclassification of $1.25 billion of our senior notes due April 2013 as a current liability, cash used for acquisitions and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders. These decreases to working capital were almost entirely offset by the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2012. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2013 in comparison to May 31, 2012 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from fiscal 2013 stock option exercises. This increase was partially offset by $11.0 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $3.3 billion of net cash paid for acquisitions, the repayments of $1.7 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to our expired revolving credit facilities, the repayment of $1.25 billion of senior notes which matured in April 2013, and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $28.2 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2013. We consider $26.2 billion of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $8.0 billion as of May 31, 2013 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2013, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased as of May 31, 2013 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2012 balance sheet date. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2012 in comparison to May 31, 2011 was primarily due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities and our short-term borrowings of $1.7 billion made pursuant to a revolving credit agreement, which expired in fiscal 2013. These increases in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by our June 2011 repayment of $1.15 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to certain expired revolving credit facilities, $255 million of cash used to repay RightNow’s legacy convertible notes after the closing of the acquisition, the use of $4.7 billion of net cash for acquisitions, the repurchases of our common stock and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Additionally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances decreased as of May 31, 2012 in comparison to May 31, 2011 due to the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to certain major international currencies during fiscal 2012. Days sales outstanding, which was calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 50 days at May 31, 2013 compared with 53 days at May 31, 2012. The days sales outstanding calculation excluded the impact of revenue adjustments that reduced our acquired cloud software subscriptions obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value. 61 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,224 3% $ 13,743 23% $ 11,214 Net cash used for investing activities $ (5,956 ) -29% $ (8,381 ) 38% $ (6,081 ) Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (8,500 ) 39% $ (6,099 ) 1,282% $ 516 Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software licenses sales and sales of hardware systems support arrangements, and to a lesser extent, sales of services, hardware systems products, and cloud software subscriptions. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012 primarily due to cash favorable impacts of increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation during fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation, an increase in cash from the collection of trade receivables, an increase in cash received that relates to our deferred revenue balances, a decrease in cash used to pay income tax obligations and certain other net cash favorable working capital movements, in each case during fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011. These cash favorable movements in fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 were partially offset by an increase in cash used to pay compensation liabilities in fiscal 2012 such as commissions and bonuses. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in each case during fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2012 due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities), in each case during fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt facilities as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2013 increased in comparison to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in our common stock repurchases (we used $11.0 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2013 in comparison to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2012) and an increase in repayments of borrowings (we repaid $3.0 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain expired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 in comparison to the repayments of $1.4 billion of short-term borrowings from expired revolving credit facilities, and legacy convertible notes assumed from RightNow in fiscal 2012), partially offset by our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises and certain other financing activity cash flow increases, net. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011: We used net cash for financing activities in fiscal 2012 of $6.1 billion in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 of $516 million primarily due to our increase in common stock repurchases, a reduction in the amount of debt that we issued, and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises, in each case during fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011. These unfavorable impacts to our financing cash flows during fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 were partially offset by a decrease in cash used for debt related repayments during fiscal 2012. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as 62 Table of Contents one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 Change 2012 Change 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,224 3% $ 13,743 23% $ 11,214 Capital expenditures(1) (650 ) 0% (648 ) 44% (450 ) Free cash flow $ 13,574 4% $ 13,095 22% $ 10,764 Net income $ 10,925 $ 9,981 $ 8,547 Free cash flow as percent of net income 124% 131% 126% (1) Derived from capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities as per our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. We financed $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, or approximately 18% of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in fiscal 2013 and 16%, of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011, and $161 million, $134 million and $117 million, respectively, or approximately 5%, of our hardware systems products revenues in fiscal 2013 and 3% of our hardware systems products revenues in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011. Recent Financing Activities: Commercial Paper Notes: On April 22, 2013, pursuant to our existing $3.0 billion commercial paper program which allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws, we entered into new dealer agreements with various banks and a new Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of May 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not have any commercial paper notes outstanding. We intend to back-stop any commercial paper notes that we may issue with our 2013 Credit Agreement (see additional details below). Additional details regarding our commercial paper program are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Revolving Credit Agreements: In April 2013, we entered into a $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain other lenders (the 2013 Credit Agreement). The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes including back-stopping any commercial paper notes that we may issue. Subject to certain conditions stated in the 2013 Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the 2013 Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Interest under the 2013 Credit Agreement is based on either (a) a LIBOR-based formula or (b) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2013 Credit Agreement. Any amounts drawn pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement are due on April 20, 2018. No amounts were outstanding pursuant to the 2013 Credit Agreement as of May 31, 2013. The 2013 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including the requirement that our total net debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 45% on a consolidated basis. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the 2013 Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the 2013 Credit Agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the 2013 Credit Agreement’s covenants as of May 31, 2013. On July 2, 2012, our revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent; and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner (the 2012 Credit Agreement) to borrow $1.7 billion was repaid in full and the 2012 Credit Agreement expired pursuant to its terms. Senior Notes: As of May 31, 2013, we had $18.5 billion of senior notes outstanding ($14.8 billion outstanding as of May 31, 2012). In April 2013, our 4.95% fixed rate senior notes for $1.25 billion matured and were repaid. In October 2012, we issued 63 Table of Contents $5.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes comprised of $2.5 billion of 1.20% notes due October 2017 and $2.5 billion of 2.50% notes due October 2022. We issued these senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness. Additional details regarding these senior notes and all other borrowings are included in the “Contractual Obligations” section below and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Cash Dividends: During fiscal 2013, our Board of Directors declared and paid cash dividends in the aggregate of $0.30 per share of outstanding common stock, which included an accelerated cash dividend of $0.18 per share of outstanding common stock paid on December 21, 2012. This accelerated cash dividend was intended by our Board of Directors to be in lieu of quarterly dividends that we would have otherwise announced with our earnings results for the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013, and that would have been paid in calendar year 2013. During fiscal 2012, we declared and paid cash dividends totaling $0.24 per share of outstanding common stock. In June 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of outstanding common stock. This $0.12 per share cash dividend was an increase of $0.06 per share over the last regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock paid on November 2, 2012 and was declared earlier than the Board of Directors had previously planned. The $0.12 per share cash dividend is payable on August 2, 2013 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 12, 2013. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the future; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June 18, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $10.0 billion. On June 20, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a further expansion by an additional $12.0 billion. As of May 31, 2013, approximately $2.1 billion remained available for stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program prior to the additional amount authorized in June 2013. We repurchased 346.1 million shares for $11.0 billion, 207.3 million shares for $6.0 billion and 40.4 million shares for $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. 64 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2013: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 18,500 $ — $ 1,500 $ 2,000 $ — $ 5,000 $ 10,000 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 10,060 770 759 748 643 628 6,512 Operating leases(2) 1,406 358 293 230 170 117 238 Purchase obligations and other(3) 806 763 26 4 1 1 11 Total contractual obligations $ 30,772 $ 1,891 $ 2,578 $ 2,982 $ 814 $ 5,746 $ 16,761 (1) Our total borrowings consisted of the following as of May 31, 2013 (dollars in millions): Amount 3.75% senior notes due July 2014, net of fair value adjustment of $41 $ 1,541 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $3 1,997 1.20% senior notes due October 2017, net of discount of $3 2,497 5.75% senior notes due April 2018, net of discount of $1 2,499 5.00% senior notes due July 2019, net of discount of $4 1,746 3.875% senior notes due July 2020, net of discount of $2 998 2.50% senior notes due October 2022, net of discount of $2 2,498 6.50% senior notes due April 2038, net of discount of $2 1,248 6.125% senior notes due July 2039, net of discount of $7 1,243 5.375% senior notes due July 2040, net of discount of $24 2,226 Total borrowings $ 18,493 We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our July 2014 senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on the July 2014 senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using an interest rate of 1.34%, which represented our effective interest rate as of May 31, 2013 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods. The changes in fair value of our debt associated with the interest rate risk that we are hedging pursuant to these agreements were included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of borrowings. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $158 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2013. (3) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. As of May 31, 2013, we had $4.3 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant tax authorities to pay approximately $15 million of these liabilities. Although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made, some or all may be made in fiscal 2014. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2014. Subsequent to fiscal 2013, we agreed to acquire a company for an amount that is not material to our business. We expect to close the acquisition within the next twelve months. 65 Table of Contents We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short-term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2014. The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2013 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 8,181 $ 9,094 $ 8,958 $ 10,947 Gross profit $ 6,289 $ 7,187 $ 7,110 $ 8,969 Operating income $ 2,879 $ 3,471 $ 3,334 $ 5,000 Net income $ 2,034 $ 2,581 $ 2,504 $ 3,807 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.42 $ 0.54 $ 0.53 $ 0.81 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.41 $ 0.53 $ 0.52 $ 0.80 Fiscal 2012 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 29 May 31 Revenues $ 8,374 $ 8,792 $ 9,039 $ 10,916 Gross profit $ 6,339 $ 6,792 $ 7,088 $ 8,853 Operating income $ 2,683 $ 3,111 $ 3,317 $ 4,596 Net income $ 1,840 $ 2,192 $ 2,498 $ 3,451 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.36 $ 0.43 $ 0.50 $ 0.70 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.43 $ 0.49 $ 0.69 Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We historically have granted only stock options to our employees and any restricted stock-based awards outstanding were assumed as a result of our acquisitions. We recognize that stock options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2010 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 2.0% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided 66 Table of Contents by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2013, which generally have a 10-year exercise period, less than 2% have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2013, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 9.6%. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants of up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option and restricted stock-based award activity from June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2013 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2010 356 Stock options granted 341 Stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed 23 Stock options exercised and restricted stock-based awards vested (204 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (68 ) Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2013 448 Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 99 Weighted average annualized stock repurchases (198 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2013 4,646 Basic weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2013 4,944 Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2013 9.6% In the money stock options and total restricted stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal period presented) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2013 9.5% Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2013 2.0% Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2013 -2.0% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to certain employees. These annual option grants are made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 67 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide, which we believe mitigates certain risks. In addition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, approximately 91% of which have maturity dates within one year of May 31, 2013 (see a description of our debt securities held in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2013, total interest income was $237 million with our investments yielding an average 0.71% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the approximate fair values of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2013 and 2012. May 31, 2013 2012 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value WeightedAverageInterestRate Fair Value WeightedAverageInterestRate Cash and cash equivalents $ 14,613 0.50% $ 14,955 0.61% Marketable securities 17,603 0.88% 15,721 0.80% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 32,216 0.71% $ 30,676 0.71% Interest Expense Risk Our total borrowings were $18.5 billion as of May 31, 2013, all of which were fixed rate borrowings. Future changes in interest rates and resulting changes in estimated fair values of our borrowings other than our senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) would not impact the interest expense we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. We have entered into certain fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate and related fair value of our 2014 Notes so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes. We have designated these swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair value of our 2014 Notes due to benchmark interest rate movements. The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable and other non-current borrowings. The periodic interest settlements for the swap agreements, which occur at the same interval as those per the 2014 Notes, are recorded as interest expense. By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Our 2014 Notes had an effective interest rate of 1.34% as of May 31, 2013, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2013, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately $15 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency 68 Table of Contents transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for a net unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of both May 31, 2013 and 2012, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.0 billion. As of May 31, 2013 and 2012, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.1 billion and $873 million, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2013 and 2012. Net foreign exchange transaction (losses) gains included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $(162) million, $(105) million and $11 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2013 were foreign currency losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations, which are more thoroughly described under “Non-Operating Income, net” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are uncertain. Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). Periodically, we may hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure. As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2013, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2013 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2012. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was a (decrease) increase of $(110) million, $(471) million and $600 million, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of May 31, 2013: (in millions) U.S. DollarEquivalent atMay 31, 2013 Euro $ 1,409 Chinese Renminbi 1,041 Indian Rupee 1,015 Australian Dollar 681 Japanese Yen 428 South African Rand 309 British Pound 259 Canadian Dollar 233 Other foreign currencies 1,784 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 7,159 69 Table of Contents If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $716 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances.",2023-12-30 16:56:32.296030
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview We are the world’s largest provider of enterprise software and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services that are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center. Our offerings include Oracle database and middleware software, application software, cloud infrastructure, hardware systems—including computer server, storage and networking products—and related services. We develop and maintain our products and services to be enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable while offering customers a choice in deployment models that best meet their information technology (IT) needs. Our customers can subscribe to use many Oracle software and hardware products through our Oracle Cloud offerings, or purchase our software and hardware products and related services to build their own internal clouds or on-premise IT environments. Cloud computing IT environments, including those offered through our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service offerings, are designed to be attractive and cost-effective options for our customers as we integrate the software and hardware on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage on the customers’ behalf. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud computing, including database and middleware software as well as web-based applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our own cloud services, our partners’ cloud services and our customers’ cloud IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to deliver reliable, secure and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work both together or independently, regardless of the deployment model selected. We believe that our investments in, and continued innovation with respect to, our software and cloud, hardware, and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans. In fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 we invested $5.2 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. We have expanded our enterprise-grade cloud computing offerings through our continued investments in research and development and through targeted acquisitions in order to broaden our Oracle Cloud offerings. For example, our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service offerings, including our sales, marketing, customer service, financials, project management, human capital and talent management cloud solutions, among others, enable us to provide IT functionality that customers can use to manage critical business functions in a rapidly deployable delivery model with lower upfront customer investment. Certain of our enterprise-grade cloud computing offerings include infrastructure based upon our Oracle Engineered Systems, including our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SuperCluster products, among others. We designed our Oracle Engineered Systems to combine certain of our hardware and software offerings to increase computing performance relative to our competitors’ products, creating cost efficiencies, time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers. Our Oracle Engineered Systems provide the core infrastructure for our own on-premise IT data centers and those of our customers, and for cloud IT environments, including our own Oracle Cloud services, our partners’ cloud services and our customers’ cloud environments. We also continue to demonstrate our commitment to customer choice through ongoing enhancements to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products and services, amongst others. We believe that an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy as it enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. 35 Table of Contents We are organized into three businesses—software and cloud, hardware systems and services—which are further divided into certain operating segments. Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Our cloud infrastructure-as-a-service segment was established during our fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2014. Our fiscal 2014 results, and historical results for fiscal 2013 and 2012, reflect this new segment structure and will continue prospectively in our future filings. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information related to our operating segments. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows. Software and Cloud Business Our software and cloud business, which represented 76%, 75% and 72% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is comprised of three operating segments: (1) new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions, (2) cloud infrastructure-as-a-service and (3) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software and cloud business’ total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and subscription offerings, our software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions: We license our database and middleware, as well as our application software, and provide access to a broad range of our software through Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Oracle Cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings (SaaS and PaaS collectively are referred to as cloud software subscriptions). Our software offerings are substantially built on a standards-based, integrated architecture that is designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure. Our software offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third party UNIX products, among others. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit their needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. The growth in our new software licenses and our SaaS and PaaS revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software licenses transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues. New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues represented 28% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 27% in fiscal 2012. Our cloud software subscriptions contracts, which consist of SaaS and PaaS arrangements, are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment’s margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment’s margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud software subscriptions obligations that we assumed in our business combinations (described further below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. For certain of our acquired businesses, we recorded adjustments to reduce the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to acquired contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $17 million, $45 million 36 Table of Contents and $22 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over their respective contractual periods. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service: Our cloud infrastructure-as-a-service offerings (IaaS), which represented 1% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 2% in fiscal 2012, provide deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed in our customers’ data centers for a monthly fee; and comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2) the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 47%, 46% and 43% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Our software support margins during fiscal 2014 were 89% and accounted for 77% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: • substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal; • substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which add to our software support contract base; and • our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported. We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $3 million, $14 million and $48 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying software support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the software support contracts over the respective support periods, the majority of which are one year. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 14% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 17% in fiscal 2012. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a 37 Table of Contents percentage of revenues than our software and cloud business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. Hardware Systems Products: We provide a broad selection of hardware systems and related services including servers, storage, networking, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the world’s largest cloud infrastructures, including the Oracle Cloud. Our hardware products and services are designed to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. This flexible and open approach provides Oracle’s customers with a broad range of choices in deploying hardware systems, which we believe is a priority for our customers. Our hardware products and services also help to meet customers’ demands to manage growing amounts of data and business requirements to meet increasing compliance and regulatory demands and to reduce energy, space and operational costs. We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as Oracle Engineered Systems. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers’ mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, flash and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments. Our networking and data center fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity. We also offer hardware and software products and services for communications networks including network signaling, policy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border control technology, amongst others. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers. To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. 38 Table of Contents Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and hardware systems operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets. Our quarterly hardware systems products revenues are difficult to predict. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server, storage and networking products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware systems support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers’ decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems’ infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting, including fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed, and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $11 million, $14 million and $30 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the respective support periods. Services Business Our services business, which represented 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 and 11% in each of fiscal 2013 and 2012, is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments. Our services business has lower margins than our software and cloud and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues. Our services business’ offerings include: • consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our products including IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners, consisting of on-premise consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; • advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their Oracle products and services; and • education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and employees through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. 39 Table of Contents Acquisitions An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including Responsys, Inc. (Responsys) and Tekelec Global, Inc. (Tekelec) in fiscal 2014, and Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet) in fiscal 2013, amongst others. On June 22, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integrated software, hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we will commence a tender offer for the outstanding shares and shares generally representing vested equity incentive awards of MICROS (collectively, MICROS Shares). MICROS shareholders will have the right to tender their MICROS Shares to Oracle in exchange for $68.00 per share in cash upon consummation of the tender offer. The tender offer will commence no later than ten business days from June 22, 2014. After completion of the tender offer and subject to certain limited conditions, MICROS will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. In addition, unvested equity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger will generally be converted into equity awards denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. The estimated total purchase price for MICROS is approximately $5.3 billion. This transaction is conditioned upon (i) at least a majority of the MICROS Shares being validly tendered to Oracle, (ii) regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (iii) the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions, and (iv) certain other customary closing conditions. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our pending and recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation 40 Table of Contents In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: (1) software and cloud revenues, including new software licenses revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products; cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees for granting customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment; cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product support revenues; (2) hardware systems revenues, which include the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers, storage products, networking and data center fabric products, and hardware systems support revenues; and (3) services, which includes software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education revenues. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and application software and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to 41 Table of Contents determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Elements) Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products and hardware systems related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware systems products revenues and hardware related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities generally for a term-based fee; and virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage. Revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Our cloud IaaS offerings also include our Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed on-premise in our customers’ data centers for a monthly fee and provide for the purchase of additional capacity on demand. Our revenue recognition policy for these on-premise offerings is in accordance with ASC 605 and ASC 840, Leases, and substantially all of these offerings are accounted for as operating leases as our contracts are structured so that the term of the arrangement is less than 75% of the economic life of the equipment and the present value of the minimum fixed payments are less than 90% of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the arrangement. Our evaluation of useful life is based on our historical product development cycles and our historical customer hardware upgrade cycles. Capacity on demand is a contingent payment and is therefore excluded from our assessment of the net present value of fixed payments. Revenue for capacity on demand is recognized in the period our customers access additional capacity provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers, storage, and networking products, including the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems. Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees. Hardware systems support contracts are entered 42 Table of Contents into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements) We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period or in the case of our cloud offerings, generally over the estimated customer relationship period. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. 43 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, hardware systems support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2) where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle; 44 Table of Contents (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets 45 Table of Contents acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts, hardware systems product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS (collectively, cloud software subscriptions), software license updates and product support, and hardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts in the amounts of $17 million, $45 million and $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $3 million, $14 million and $48 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $11 million, $14 million and $30 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS and hardware systems support contracts. To the extent cloud SaaS and PaaS, software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the contracts’ periods, which are generally one year in duration. In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. 46 Table of Contents We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two step impairment test will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed on March 1, 2014, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013 or 2012. Our consulting and hardware systems products reporting units have experienced revenues and operating margin declines in fiscal 2014 as compared to prior years. As a result, our consulting and hardware systems products reporting units may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for these reporting units differ from our projections. 47 Table of Contents We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly 48 Table of Contents judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock-based awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based upon historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. 49 Table of Contents We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon U.S. treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of publicly traded options in our stock in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of publicly traded options in our stock, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Responsys in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Tekelec in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 is impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, Taleo Corporation (Taleo) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and RightNow Technologies, Inc. (RightNow) during the third quarter of fiscal 2012. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, we may qualitatively disclose the impacts of our acquired products (for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in our new software licenses revenues, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, software license updates and product support revenues, hardware systems products revenues and hardware systems support revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products. The contributions of our acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments’ revenues and to the expense contributions for substantially all of our businesses and operating segments in each of the respective period comparisons are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. 50 Table of Contents We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and • although substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service deferred revenues, software license updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2013, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2014 and 2013, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.36 million in fiscal 2014 (using 1.36 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.29 million in fiscal 2013 (using 1.29 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2014 results using the fiscal 2013 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 51 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2014 Actual Constant 2013 Actual Constant 2012 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 20,323 3% 4% $ 19,719 3% 3% $ 19,236 EMEA(1) 11,946 7% 4% 11,158 -3% 0% 11,561 Asia Pacific(2) 6,006 -5% 2% 6,303 0% 3% 6,324 Total revenues 38,275 3% 4% 37,180 0% 2% 37,121 Total Operating Expenses 23,516 5% 6% 22,496 -4% -2% 23,415 Total Operating Margin $ 14,759 1% 1% $ 14,684 7% 10% $ 13,706 Total Operating Margin % 39% 39% 37% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 53% 53% 52% EMEA 31% 30% 31% Asia Pacific 16% 17% 17% Total Revenues by Business: Software and Cloud $ 29,199 5% 5% $ 27,920 5% 7% $ 26,560 Hardware Systems 5,372 0% 2% 5,346 -15% -13% 6,302 Services 3,704 -5% -4% 3,914 -8% -6% 4,259 Total revenues $ 38,275 3% 4% $ 37,180 0% 2% $ 37,121 % Revenues by Business: Software and Cloud 76% 75% 72% Hardware Systems 14% 14% 17% Services 10% 11% 11% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) Asia Pacific includes Japan Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: On a constant currency basis, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2014 by 4 percentage points due to increases in our software and cloud business revenues and our hardware business revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our services business revenues. The constant currency growth in our software and cloud business was substantially attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and, to a lesser extent, our cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) revenues due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. The constant currency revenues growth in our hardware business was due to an increase in our hardware systems support revenues due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions and due to increases in our hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems, partially offset by revenue decreases attributable to reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our legacy hardware product lines, including lower margin products. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 61%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 9% to our total revenues growth during fiscal 2014. Total constant currency operating expenses increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting from increased headcount, higher sales-based variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth, and an increase in cloud SaaS and PaaS costs resulting from additional expenses incurred to support the increases in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues. These expense increases in fiscal 2014 were partially offset by lower constant currency expenses from our hardware systems support and services segments due to decreased headcount, lower restructuring expenses, and lower intangible assets amortization. In fiscal 2013, we recognized a $387 million acquisition related benefit (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information) and a $306 million benefit relating to certain litigation (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), both of which decreased our acquisition related and other expenses during this period. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our operating margin increased during fiscal 2014 due to our revenues growth, while our operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat. 52 Table of Contents Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2013 due to an increase in our software and cloud business revenues. This constant currency increase was partially offset by reductions in our hardware systems and services business’ revenues. On a constant currency basis, the Americas region contributed 77% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 23% to our growth in total revenues during fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a $387 million acquisition related benefit and a $306 million benefit related to certain litigation (both as noted above), lower hardware systems products costs associated with lower hardware systems products revenues, and certain other operating expense decreases in most of our other lines of business primarily due to lower variable compensation expenses, lower external contractor expenses and lower amortization of intangible assets. In constant currency, these total expense decreases during fiscal 2013 were partially offset by higher salary and benefit expenses due primarily to additional sales and marketing and research and development headcount added during fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating margin and our total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our total revenues and the decrease in our total operating expenses. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other significant expense and income items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service deferred revenues(1) $ 17 $ 45 $ 22 Software license updates and product support deferred revenues(1) 3 14 48 Hardware systems support deferred revenues(1) 11 14 30 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 2,300 2,385 2,430 Acquisition related and other(3)(5) 41 (604 ) 56 Restructuring(4) 183 352 295 Stock-based compensation(5) 795 722 626 Income tax effects(6) (1,091 ) (896 ) (967 ) $ 2,259 $ 2,032 $ 2,540 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $17 million, $45 million and $22 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We also did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $3 million, $14 million and $48 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $11 million, $14 million and $30 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Approximately $3 million of estimated cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2015 that would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $2 million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2015 that would have otherwise been recognized by certain acquired companies as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. 53 Table of Contents (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2014, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2015 $ 1,934 Fiscal 2016 1,337 Fiscal 2017 741 Fiscal 2018 607 Fiscal 2019 508 Thereafter 980 Total intangible assets subject to amortization 6,107 In-process research and development 30 Total intangible assets, net $ 6,137 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. In fiscal 2013, acquisition related and other expenses included a benefit of $306 million related to certain litigation (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), and a net benefit of $387 million due to a change in the fair value of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). (4) The significant majority of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2014 and 2013 related to employee severance and facility exit costs in connection with our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan (the 2013 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2012 primarily related to costs incurred pursuant to our Sun Restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (5) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2014 2013 2012 Sales and marketing $ 165 $ 137 $ 115 Cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service 8 10 7 Cloud infrastructure-as-a-service 4 8 6 Software license updates and product support 22 20 18 Hardware systems products 5 3 1 Hardware systems support 6 5 5 Services 29 23 17 Research and development 385 352 295 General and administrative 171 164 162 Subtotal 795 722 626 Acquisition related and other 10 33 33 Total stock-based compensation $ 805 $ 755 $ 659 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. (6) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects for fiscal 2014 and 2013 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 22.5% and 23.0%, respectively, instead of 20.1% and 21.4%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. Income tax effects for fiscal 2012 were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 24.0%, instead of 23.0% which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations, due to the disproportionate rate impact of certain discrete items, income tax effects related to our acquired tax exposures, and differences in jurisdictional tax rates and related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in the period. Software and Cloud Business Our software and cloud business consists of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment, our cloud infrastructure-as-a-service segment and our software license updates and product support segment. New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions: New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware and our application software 54 Table of Contents products. Cloud software subscriptions include revenues from our cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service offerings, which grant customers access to a broad range of our software offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based, cloud computing environment that includes access, hosting, infrastructure management, the use of software updates, and support. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Costs associated with our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment are included in sales and marketing expenses, cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service expenses and amortization of intangible assets. These costs are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software offerings, marketing program costs, the cost of providing our cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service offerings and amortization of intangible assets.

In constant currency, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues growth in the Americas and EMEA region was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the Asia Pacific region. In constant currency, our new software license revenues increased by 1% in fiscal 2014 and our SaaS and PaaS revenues increased by 24% in fiscal 2014, both primarily due to incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues in the amounts of $17 million, $45 million and $22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2014, 55 Table of Contents 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts over the respective contractual periods. In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 3% in fiscal 2014 and represented 33% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2014 in comparison to 32% in fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth, and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses resulting from costs incurred to support the related revenue increases. Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2014 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues for this operating segment. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased during fiscal 2013 due to growth across all regions and incremental revenues from our acquisitions. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 69%, EMEA contributed 23% and Asia Pacific contributed 8% to the increase in new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues during fiscal 2013. In constant currency, our new software licenses revenues increased by 1% and our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues increased by 100% in fiscal 2013 primarily due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. As described above, the amount of new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were affected by business combination accounting rules. In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 11% in fiscal 2013 and represented 32% of our total new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2013 in comparison to 29% in fiscal 2012. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to higher employee related expenses and stock-based compensation from increased headcount, and higher intangible asset amortization, partially offset by a decrease in certain legal costs. Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues for this operating segment. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service: Our cloud infrastructure-as-a-service segment provides deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed in our customers’ data centers for a monthly fee; and comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Cloud infrastructure-as-a-service expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures, technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities costs. For all periods presented, our cloud-infrastructure-as-a-service segment’s revenues and expenses were substantially attributable to our IT infrastructure management, maintenance and hosting services offerings. 56 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2014 Actual Constant 2013 Actual Constant 2012 Cloud Infastructure-as-a-Service: Americas $ 335 -6% -5% $ 355 5% 6% $ 337 EMEA 94 32% 27% 72 -6% -1% 76 Asia Pacific 27 -12% 3% 30 -1% 4% 31 Total revenues 456 0% 1% 457 3% 5% 444 Expenses: Cloud infastructure-as-a-service(1) 304 3% 5% 296 5% 8% 283 Sales and marketing(1) 61 0% 1% 61 -15% -14% 72 Stock-based compensation 4 -52% -52% 8 28% 28% 6 Total expenses 369 1% 3% 365 1% 4% 361 Total Margin $ 87 -6% -9% $ 92 10% 8% $ 83 Total Margin % 19% 20% 19% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 73% 77% 76% EMEA 21% 16% 17% Asia Pacific 6% 7% 7% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS revenues increased slightly in fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from the recent introduction of our on-premise Oracle Engineered Systems subscription offerings. In constant currency, total cloud IaaS revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a decline in revenues in the Americas region. On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS expenses increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with increased headcount, which reduced the total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues for this segment. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS revenues increased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to growth in our infrastructure management, maintenance and hosting services offerings. In constant currency, total cloud IaaS revenues growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a decline in revenues in the EMEA region. On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS expenses increased during fiscal 2013 primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with increased headcount. Total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2013 as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses for this segment. Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from acquisitions. 57 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2014 Actual Constant 2013 Actual Constant 2012 Software License Updates and Product Support Revenues: Americas $ 9,858 6% 7% $ 9,322 7% 8% $ 8,672 EMEA 5,906 10% 7% 5,363 3% 7% 5,194 Asia Pacific 2,442 -1% 8% 2,457 5% 9% 2,344 Total revenues 18,206 6% 7% 17,142 6% 8% 16,210 Expenses: Software license updates and product support(1) 1,140 -1% 0% 1,155 -4% -2% 1,208 Stock-based compensation 22 10% 10% 20 12% 12% 18 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 801 -4% -4% 836 -3% -3% 863 Total expenses 1,963 -2% -1% 2,011 -4% -2% 2,089 Total Margin $ 16,243 7% 8% $ 15,131 7% 10% $ 14,121 Total Margin % 89% 88% 87% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 54% 55% 54% EMEA 33% 31% 32% Asia Pacific 13% 14% 14% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation (2) Included as a component of ‘Amortization of Intangible Assets’ in our consolidated statements of operations Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Excluding the effect of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased by 7% in fiscal 2014 as a result of new software licenses sold with substantially all of these customers electing to purchase software support contracts during the trailing 4-quarter period, and the renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the trailing 4-quarter period. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 15% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed software support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts in the amounts of $3 million, $14 million and $48 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in duration. Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses during fiscal 2014 decreased slightly due to a modest decrease in headcount and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. Margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2014 as our total revenues for this segment increased while our total expenses slightly decreased. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2013 for similar reasons as those noted above for our fiscal 2014 revenues increase and due to incremental revenues from recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 56%, EMEA contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 15% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues. As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were affected by business combination accounting rules. 58 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets, a reduction in certain non-income based taxes, lower bad debt expenses, and lower variable compensation expenses. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2013 as our total revenues for this segment increased while our total expenses decreased. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment. Hardware Systems Products: Hardware systems products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our computer server, storage and networking products, including sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We market and sell our hardware systems products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products include the cost of hardware systems products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware systems products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

The decrease in revenues during fiscal 2014, which was attributable to reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our legacy product lines, including lower margin 59 Table of Contents products, was partially offset by incremental revenues from our recently acquired companies and increases in hardware revenues attributable to our sales of Oracle Engineered Systems. In constant currency, total hardware systems products operating expenses increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2014 due to a decrease in our total revenues and increase in our total expenses for this segment. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: On a constant currency basis, hardware systems products revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our legacy product lines, including lower margin products. These revenue decreases were partially offset by increases in hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems. On a constant currency basis, total hardware systems products operating expenses declined in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a reduction in hardware systems products costs associated with lower hardware revenues, a decrease in employee related expenses due to decreased hardware systems sales headcount, and lower intangible asset amortization. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 as our total revenues for this segment decreased at a faster rate than our total expenses. Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server, storage and networking products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware systems support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with hardware systems support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

These hardware support revenues increases were partially offset by certain hardware support revenues decreases that were generally caused by the reductions in sales volumes of certain of our legacy hardware systems product lines for which we offer hardware systems support. In constant currency, hardware systems support revenues growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific region was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the EMEA region. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $11 million, $14 million and $30 million that would have been otherwise reported by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent these underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support periods. Total hardware systems support expenses decreased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction in employee related expenses attributable to decreased headcount and reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives, partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2014 as our total revenues for this segment increased while our total expenses for this segment decreased. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Excluding the impact of currency rate fluctuations, hardware systems support revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our legacy hardware systems product lines for which we offer hardware systems support. As described above, the amounts of hardware systems support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were affected by business combination accounting rules. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a reduction in employee related expenses attributable to decreased headcount, reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives, lower bad debt expenses, and lower amortization of intangible assets. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2013 due to the reduction in our total hardware systems support expenses.

The largest services revenues decrease was to our consulting segment’s revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our total services expenses decreased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to expense decreases in our consulting services segment due to decreased headcount, lower external contractor costs, lower intangible asset amortization, and a decrease in certain other operating expenses, net. In constant currency, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues increased during fiscal 2014 due to our expense reductions for this business. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2013 due to revenue decreases in each of our services segments. The largest services revenues decrease in fiscal 2013 was to our consulting segment’s revenues. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, total services expenses decreased during fiscal 2013 primarily due to expense decreases across all of our services segments, which consisted primarily of decreases in external contractor costs, lower variable compensation expenses, and lower intangible asset amortization. In constant currency, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased during fiscal 2013 as our total services revenues declined at a faster rate than our total services expenses.

We recorded a net benefit of $387 million during fiscal 2013 related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). We also recorded a $306 million benefit in fiscal 2013 to professional fees and other, net related to certain litigation (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: On a constant currency basis, the decrease in our acquisition related and other expenses in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the aforementioned benefits described above. Restructuring expenses: Restructuring expenses result from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

We amended the 2013 Restructuring Plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to reflect additional actions that we expect to take to improve efficiencies in our operations. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2013 Restructuring Plan are $705 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. The total estimated remaining restructuring costs associated with the 2013 Restructuring Plan were approximately 64 Table of Contents $206 million as of May 31, 2014. The majority of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal 2015. Our estimated costs may be subject to change in future periods. Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2012 primarily related to our Sun Restructuring Plan, which our management approved, committed to and initiated in order to better align our cost structure as a result of our acquisition of Sun.

Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2013 due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, partially offset by the maturity and repayment of $1.25 billion of senior notes in April 2013. Non-Operating (Expense) Income, net: Non-operating (expense) income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses) including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

The Venezuelan economy has been determined to be “highly inflationary” in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. As a result, we report all net monetary assets related to our Venezuelan subsidiary in U.S. Dollars with the associated impacts of periodic changes of Bolivar Fuerte (“VEF”) to U.S. Dollar exchange rates in our statements of operations for each respective reporting period. During fiscal 2014, the Venezuelan government issued new exchange agreements that allowed for certain foreign currency transactions, which previously were subject to Venezuela’s official Bolivar Fuerte (“VEF”) to U.S. Dollar exchange rate (the “Official Rate”), to be subject to conversion at rates established at the Venezuelan government’s auction-based exchange rate programs, the Complementary System for Foreign Currency Administration (“SICAD”) rates. These SICAD rates were lower than the Official Rate that we had used historically to report the VEF based transactions and net monetary assets of our 65 Table of Contents Venezuelan subsidiary. To determine which of the various VEF rates to use during fiscal 2014, we evaluated our individual facts and circumstances taking into consideration our legal ability to convert VEF at or to settle VEF based transactions using the SICAD rates, amongst other factors. We concluded that using the SICAD rates was the most appropriate for our reporting of our Venezuelan subsidiary’s VEF based transactions and net monetary assets in U.S. Dollars, which resulted in the $213 million of fiscal 2014 remeasurement losses referenced above. Future devaluations of the Venezuelan currency are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility and incur additional remeasurement losses in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses, net, that included a foreign currency loss relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations. During our third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and we recognized a $64 million foreign currency loss as a result of the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. This decrease in non-operating income, net was partially offset by an increase in other income, net during fiscal 2013, which was primarily due to gains from our marketable securities that we designated as trading that were held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations. Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2014 Actual Constant 2013 Actual Constant 2012 Provision for income taxes $ 2,749 -7% -6% $ 2,973 0% 3% $ 2,981 Effective tax rate 20.1% 21.4% 23.0% Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014 decreased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2013, due to a tax favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings and the effects of acquisition related settlements with tax authorities during fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2013 decreased slightly due to acquisition related items, the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development credit, offset by higher income before provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Working capital $ 33,749 17% $ 28,820 17% $ 24,635 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 38,819 20% $ 32,216 5% $ 30,676 Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2014 in comparison to May 31, 2013 was primarily due to our issuance of €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2013, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2014, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These working capital increases were partially offset by the reclassification of $1.5 billion of senior notes due July 2014 from long-term to current, cash used for repurchases of our common stock (we used $9.8 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2014), cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions, all of which occurred during fiscal 2014. Our working capital 66 Table of Contents may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2013 in comparison to May 31, 2012 was primarily due to our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2013, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. This increase was partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock (we used $11.0 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2013), cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2014 in comparison to May 31, 2013 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes in July 2013, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were partially offset by $9.8 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $3.5 billion of net cash paid for acquisitions and $2.2 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $35.2 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2014. We consider $32.4 billion of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $10.0 billion as of May 31, 2014 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar modestly strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2014, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2014 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2013 balance sheet date. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2013 in comparison to May 31, 2012 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from fiscal 2013 stock option exercises. This increase was partially offset by $11.0 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $3.3 billion of net cash paid for acquisitions, the repayments of $1.7 billion of short-term borrowings pursuant to our expired revolving credit facilities, the repayment of $1.25 billion of senior notes which matured in April 2013, and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31, 2013 decreased in comparison to May 31, 2012 due to the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to certain major international currencies during fiscal 2013. Days sales outstanding, which was calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 48 days at May 31, 2014 compared with 50 days at May 31, 2013. The days sales outstanding calculation excluded the impact of revenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,921 5% $ 14,224 3% $ 13,743 Net cash used for investing activities $ (7,539 ) 27% $ (5,956 ) -29% $ (8,381 ) Net cash used for financing activities $ (4,068 ) -52% $ (8,500 ) 39% $ (6,099 ) 67 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software licenses sales and sales of hardware systems support arrangements, and to a lesser extent, sales of services, hardware systems products, and cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the following: the fiscal 2013 non-recurring impacts of a reduction of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition of $387 million (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information) and the impact of a $306 million non-current receivable related to certain litigation (see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), both of which increased our net income in fiscal 2013 without the corresponding cash flow benefits. These items did not recur during fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012 primarily due to cash favorable impacts of increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and depreciation during fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2014 due to an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in each case during fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in each case during fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2014 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the repayment of $3.0 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain expired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 (no repayments during fiscal 2014), a net increase in borrowings during fiscal 2014 (we issued €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2014 in comparison to $5.0 billion of senior notes issued during fiscal 2013), lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2014 and higher proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2014. These fiscal 2014 cash favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in payments of cash dividends to stockholders in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2013 increased in comparison to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in our common stock repurchases (we used $11.0 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2013 in comparison to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2012) and an increase in repayments of borrowings (we repaid $3.0 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain expired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 in comparison to the repayments of $1.4 billion of short-term borrowings from expired revolving credit facilities, and legacy convertible notes assumed from RightNow in fiscal 2012), partially offset by our issuance of $5.0 billion of senior notes in October 2012, an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises and certain other financing activity cash flow increases, net. 68 Table of Contents Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,921 5% $ 14,224 3% $ 13,743 Capital expenditures(1) (580 ) -11% (650 ) 0% (648 ) Free cash flow $ 14,341 6% $ 13,574 4% $ 13,095 Net income $ 10,955 $ 10,925 $ 9,981 Free cash flow as percent of net income 131% 124% 131% (1) Derived from capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities as per our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. We financed $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, or approximately 17%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, and $168 million, $161 million and $134 million, respectively, or approximately 6%, 5%, and 3%, respectively, of our hardware systems products revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. Recent Financing Activities: Senior Notes: As of May 31, 2014, we had $24.2 billion of senior notes outstanding ($18.5 billion outstanding as of May 31, 2013). In July 2013, we issued €2.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of May 31, 2014) of fixed rate senior notes comprised of €1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and €750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. We are accounting for the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). In July 2013, we also issued $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes due January 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes), $1.5 billion of 2.375% notes due January 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.0 billion of 3.625% notes due July 2023 (2023 Notes, and together with the Floating Rate Notes and 2019 Notes, the U.S. Dollar Notes). We issued the Euro Notes and the U.S. Dollar Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future acquisitions. Additional details regarding the Euro Notes, the U.S. Dollar Notes, and the related hedge accounting are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Interest Rate Swap Agreements: In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. As of May 31, 2014, our 2019 Notes had an effective interest rate of 0.88% after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 69 Table of Contents Cross Currency Swap Agreements: In July 2013, in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related cross-currency swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2014, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.48 per share that totaled $2.2 billion. In June 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of outstanding common stock payable on July 30, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 9, 2014. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On June 20, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $12.0 billion. As of May 31, 2014, approximately $4.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program. We repurchased 280.4 million shares for $9.8 billion, 346.1 million shares for $11.0 billion, and 207.3 million shares for $6.0 billion in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2014: 70 Table of Contents Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 24,120 $ 1,500 $ 2,000 $ — $ 5,000 $ 2,000 $ 13,620 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 10,390 883 873 768 752 592 6,522 Operating leases(2) 1,398 373 304 230 168 120 203 Purchase obligations and other(3) 510 469 28 12 1 — — Total contractual obligations $ 36,418 $ 3,225 $ 3,205 $ 1,010 $ 5,921 $ 2,712 $ 20,345 (1) Our total borrowings consisted of the following as of May 31, 2014 (dollars in millions): Amount 3.75% senior notes due July 2014, net of fair value adjustment of $8 $ 1,508 5.25% senior notes due January 2016, net of discount of $2 1,998 1.20% senior notes due October 2017, net of discount of $3 2,497 5.75% senior notes due April 2018 2,500 Floating rate senior notes due January 2019 500 2.375% senior notes due January 2019, net of fair value adjustment of $15 and discount of $5 1,510 5.00% senior notes due July 2019, net of discount of $3 1,747 3.875% senior notes due July 2020, net of discount of $1 999 2.25% senior notes due January 2021, net of discount of $9 1,691 2.50% senior notes due October 2022, net of discount of $2 2,498 3.625% senior notes due July 2023, net of discount of $8 992 3.125% senior notes due July 2025, net of discount of $3 1,017 6.50% senior notes due April 2038, net of discount of $2 1,248 6.125% senior notes due July 2039, net of discount of $7 1,243 5.375% senior notes due July 2040, net of discount of $23 2,227 Total borrowings $ 24,175 We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) and our 2019 Notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using interest rates of 1.29% and 0.88%, respectively, which represented our effective interest rates for these senior notes as of May 31, 2014 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods. The changes in fair values of our debt associated with the interest rate risks that we are hedging pursuant to these agreements were included in notes payable and other current borrowings for the 2014 Notes and notes payable and other non-current borrowings for the 2019 Notes in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of total borrowings as of May 31, 2014. Our floating rate senior notes due January 2019 bore interest at a rate of 0.81% as of May 31, 2014 and interest payments on these notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using this rate. The 2021 Notes and the 2025 Notes are denominated in Euro. In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed rate, Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. Principal and interest payments for the 2021 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were calculated based on the terms of the aforementioned cross-currency swap agreements. Principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2014. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $112 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2014. (3) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. 71 Table of Contents On June 22, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS), a provider of integrated software, hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we will commence a tender offer for the outstanding shares and shares generally representing vested equity incentive awards of MICROS (collectively, MICROS Shares). MICROS shareholders will have the right to tender their MICROS Shares to Oracle in exchange for $68.00 per share in cash upon consummation of the tender offer. The tender offer will commence no later than ten business days from June 22, 2014. After completion of the tender offer and subject to certain limited conditions, MICROS will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. In addition, unvested equity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger will generally be converted into equity awards denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement. The estimated total purchase price for MICROS is approximately $5.3 billion. This transaction is conditioned upon (i) at least a majority of the MICROS Shares being validly tendered to Oracle, (ii) regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (iii) the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions, and (iv) certain other customary closing conditions. We also have entered into certain other agreements to acquire other companies and expect these proposed acquisitions to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We intend to finance our proposed acquisitions through a combination of our internally available cash, our cash generated from operations, our existing available debt capacity, additional borrowings, or from the issuance of additional securities. As of May 31, 2014, we had $4.5 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2015. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short-term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2015. 72 Table of Contents The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2014 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 8,372 $ 9,275 $ 9,307 $ 11,320 Gross profit $ 6,607 $ 7,420 $ 7,490 $ 9,340 Operating income $ 2,873 $ 3,410 $ 3,567 $ 4,909 Net income $ 2,191 $ 2,553 $ 2,565 $ 3,646 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.48 $ 0.56 $ 0.57 $ 0.81 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.47 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.80 Fiscal 2013 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 8,181 $ 9,094 $ 8,958 $ 10,947 Gross profit $ 6,305 $ 7,200 $ 7,122 $ 8,984 Operating income $ 2,879 $ 3,471 $ 3,334 $ 5,000 Net income $ 2,034 $ 2,581 $ 2,504 $ 3,807 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.42 $ 0.54 $ 0.53 $ 0.81 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.41 $ 0.53 $ 0.52 $ 0.80 Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We historically have granted only stock options to our employees and any restricted stock-based awards outstanding were assumed as a result of our acquisitions. We recognize that stock options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2011 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 2.3% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2014, which generally have a 10-year exercise period, less than 1.0% have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2014, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the current market price, was 10.4%. 73 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock option grants of up to 100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option and restricted stock-based award activity from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2014 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2011 356 Stock options granted 362 Stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed 28 Stock options exercised and restricted stock-based awards vested (219 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (64 ) Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2014 463 Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 109 Weighted average annualized stock repurchases (278 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2014 4,464 Basic weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2014 4,771 Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2014 10.4% In the money stock options and total restricted stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal period presented) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2014 10.3% Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2014 2.3% Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2014 -3.5% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide option grants to certain employees. These annual option grants were historically made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment grade credit ratings, which we believe mitigates certain risks. In addition, we purchase high quality debt security investments, approximately 45% of which have maturity dates within one year and 55% of which have maturity dates within one to four years as of May 31, 2014 (see a description of our debt securities held in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). Interest rate movements can impact the valuation of our debt securities but are presently not significant to our valuations considering the current interest rate environment and the duration of our portfolio. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2014, total interest income was $263 million with our cash, cash 74 Table of Contents equivalents and marketable investments yielding an average 0.79% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the approximate fair values of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2014 and 2013.

In July 2013, we issued €2.0 billion ($2.7 billion as of May 31, 2014) of fixed rate senior notes and $3.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $500 million of floating rate notes and $2.5 billion of fixed rate notes as described in the “Recent Financing Activities” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) in this Annual Report. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (2019 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2019 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In September 2009, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 (2014 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to match, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. As of May 31, 2014, our 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes had effective interest rates of 1.29% and 0.88%, respectively, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2014, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately $22 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating rate borrowings. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Risks—Foreign Currency Borrowings and Related Hedges In July 2013, we issued €1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (2021 Notes) and we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. 75 Table of Contents In July 2013, we also issued €750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes). We designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $34 million of net other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2014. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes representing the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating (expense) income, net. We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2014. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar weakened by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May 31, 2014, our obligation to settle the 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased by approximately $102 million. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for a net unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating (expense) income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2014 and 2013, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2014 and 2013, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2014 and 2013. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $375 million, $162 million and $105 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were foreign currency losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations, which are more thoroughly described under “Non-Operating (Expense) Income, net” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. 76 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2014, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2014 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2013. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were decreases of $158 million, $110 million and $471 million, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of May 31, 2014: (in millions) U.S. DollarEquivalent atMay 31, 2014 Euro $ 1,843 Indian Rupee 1,172 Australian Dollar 724 Japanese Yen 550 Chinese Renminbi 535 Canadian Dollar 385 South African Rand 341 British Pound 325 Other foreign currencies 2,148 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 8,023 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $802 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.",2023-12-30 16:56:30.548154
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—application, platform and infrastructure—and are available to customers either via cloud computing or on-premises deployment models. Our products include database and middleware software, application software, cloud infrastructure software, and hardware systems (Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking and industry specific products), along with support and related services. We offer over 400,000 worldwide customers a choice of deployment models to best suit their needs including (1) the deployment of our products via our Oracle Cloud offerings, (2) the acquisition of Oracle products and services for an on-premises IT environment or (3) a mix of these two models. For customers opting for a cloud computing model, Oracle offers a wide range of services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be: rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; and cost effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment. Our Oracle Cloud offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners’ cloud services and our customers’ cloud IT environments. In addition to offering a broad spectrum of cloud products and services, Oracle for decades has developed and sold its products and services to our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and on-premises IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we offer through our software and cloud, hardware and services businesses. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we invested $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. We have a deep understanding as to how all components within IT environments—application, platform and infrastructure—interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After purchasing Oracle products and services, customers can continue to take advantage of Oracle’s research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products, among others, or renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us. Oracle customers are increasingly electing to run their IT environments using our suite of Oracle Cloud offerings. As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premises, and both sets of resources can be managed as one. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect these different deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. 37 Table of Contents In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. We have three businesses that deliver our application, platform and infrastructure technologies: software and cloud, hardware systems, and services. These businesses can be further divided into certain operating segments (Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our operating segments). Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows. Software and Cloud Business Our software and cloud business, which represented 77%, 76% and 75% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is comprised of three operating segments: (1) new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions, (2) cloud infrastructure as a service and (3) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our software and cloud business’ total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and cloud software subscription offerings, our software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow and continue to make investments in research and development. New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions: Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions line of business markets, sells and delivers our application and platform technologies including our SaaS and PaaS offerings (our SaaS and PaaS offerings are collectively referred to as cloud software subscriptions), which provide customers a choice of software applications and platforms that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and support, and the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others. Our application and platform technologies are substantially built on standards-based architectures that are designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure. Our commitment to industry standards results in software that works in customer environments with Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components and that can be adapted to meet specific industry or business needs. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect cloud and on-premises deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. Our software offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premises IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third party UNIX products, among others. These approaches are designed to support customer choice and reduce customer risk. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit their needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. The growth in our new software licenses and our SaaS and PaaS revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations. The substantial majority of our new software license transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues. New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues represented 26% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015 and 28% in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013. Our cloud software subscriptions contracts, which consist of SaaS and PaaS arrangements, are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment’s margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical 38 Table of Contents upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short-term. However, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment’s margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations that we assumed in our business combinations (described further below) and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. For certain of our acquired businesses, we recorded adjustments to reduce the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to acquired contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $12 million, $17 million and $45 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over their respective contractual periods. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service: Our cloud infrastructure as a service offerings, which represented 2% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015 and 1% in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013, provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premises at customer facilities; deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage; and certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems and related support offerings that are deployed in our customers’ data centers for a monthly fee. Software License Updates and Product Support: Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration. Substantially all of our software license customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2) the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 49%, 47% and 46% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Our software support margins during fiscal 2015 were 90% and accounted for 81% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations (described further below) and by amortization of intangible assets. However, over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: • substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal; • substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which add to our software support contract base; and • our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported. We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business combination accounting rules, 39 Table of Contents we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying software support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the software support contracts over the respective support periods, the majority of which are one year. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware systems products and (2) hardware systems support. Our hardware business represented 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software and cloud business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. Hardware Systems Products: We provide a broad selection of hardware systems and related services including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking, workstations and related devices, industry specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premises IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the world’s largest cloud infrastructures, including the Oracle Cloud. Our hardware systems products are designed to be easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve computing performance relative to our competitors’ offerings. We design our hardware products to seamlessly connect on-premises and cloud IT environments to further enable interoperability, interchangeability and extendibility and to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. Our flexible and open approach provides Oracle customers with a broad range of choices in how they deploy our hardware products, which we believe is a priority for our customers. Oracle Engineered Systems are core to our hardware offerings and are important elements of our data center and cloud computing offerings including the Oracle Cloud. These pre-integrated products are designed to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance, availability, security and operational efficiency relative to our competitors’ products, to be upgraded effectively and efficiently and to simplify maintenance cycles by providing a single solution for software patching. Oracle Engineered Systems are tested before they are shipped to customers and delivered ready-to-run, enabling customers to shorten the time to production. We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer better performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessors from Intel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. Our storage products are designed to securely manage, protect, archive and restore customers’ mission critical data assets and consist of tape, disk, flash and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments. 40 Table of Contents Our networking and data center fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity. We offer hardware products and services designed for specific industries. Our point-of-sale hardware offerings include point-of-sale terminals and related hardware that are designed for managing businesses within the food and beverage, hotel and retail industries, among others. Our hardware products and services for communications networks include network signaling, policy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border control technology, among others. The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value added resellers. To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Our hardware systems products revenues, cost of hardware systems products and hardware systems operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets. Our quarterly hardware systems products revenues are difficult to predict. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, among other factors, could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Systems Support: Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware systems support contract arrangements are priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees, are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware systems support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers’ decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems’ infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting, including fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed, and by the amortization of intangible assets. As required by business combination accounting rules, we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values. These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by 41 Table of Contents the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $4 million, $11 million and $14 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the respective support periods. Services Business Our services business, which represented 9%, 10% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively, is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments. Our services business has lower margins than our software and cloud and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues. Our services business’ offerings include: • consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our products, including IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners, consisting of on-premises consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; • advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premises and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their Oracle products and services; and • education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and employees through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. Acquisitions A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies including MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS) in fiscal 2015, Responsys, Inc. (Responsys) and Tekelec Global, Inc. (Tekelec) in fiscal 2014, and Acme Packet, Inc. (Acme Packet) in fiscal 2013, among others. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these 42 Table of Contents estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: • Revenue Recognition • Business Combinations • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments • Accounting for Income Taxes • Legal and Other Contingencies • Stock-Based Compensation In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: (1) software and cloud revenues, including new software licenses revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products and industry specific software; cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees for granting customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment; cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product support revenues (described further below); (2) hardware systems revenues, which include the sale of hardware systems products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage products, networking and data center fabric products, and industry specific hardware; and hardware systems support revenues; and (3) services, which include software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education revenues. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and application software and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy, for example, in agreements with government entities where 43 Table of Contents acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature, we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Elements) Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware systems products revenues, support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. 44 Table of Contents Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premises at customer facilities generally for a term-based fee; and virtual machine instances that are subscription-based and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage. Revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, networking and industry specific hardware. Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees. Hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which are typically one year. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Systems Products, Hardware Systems Support and Related Services (Nonsoftware Arrangements) We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a nonsoftware multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For our nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware systems product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE 45 Table of Contents is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware systems products, hardware systems support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support 46 Table of Contents services, both on-premises and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware systems products revenues, including the costs of hardware systems products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud, hardware systems and services arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees; (2) where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software or hardware systems products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 47 Table of Contents Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, hardware systems product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS (collectively, cloud software subscriptions), software license updates and product support, and hardware systems support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the 48 Table of Contents acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts in the amounts of $12 million, $17 million and $45 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $4 million, $11 million and $14 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS, and hardware systems support contracts. To the extent cloud SaaS and PaaS, software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over their respective contractual periods, which are generally one year in duration. In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for 49 Table of Contents impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Based upon our most recent annual goodwill impairment review which took place as of March 1, 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss related to our hardware systems products reporting unit. We considered several approaches to determine the fair value of our hardware systems reporting unit and concluded the most appropriate to be the income approach. Based upon the completion of our annual forecasting process, the fair value of our hardware systems products reporting unit under the income approach was impacted by lower forecasted operating results, primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues and our continued investment in research and development activities. We compared the implied fair value of goodwill in our hardware systems products reporting unit to its carrying value, which resulted in a $186 million goodwill impairment loss, representing the aggregate amount of goodwill in our hardware systems products reporting unit. The aggregate hardware systems reporting unit goodwill that was impaired in fiscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pillar Data Systems, Inc., Xsigo Systems, Inc., GreenBytes, Inc. and MICROS Systems, Inc. Such impairment loss was recorded to acquisition related and other expenses in our fiscal 2015 consolidated statement of operations. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal 2014 or 2013. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment review for our other reporting units, which also took place on March 1, 2015, did not result in a goodwill impairment loss. Other than our consulting reporting unit, all of our other reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values. Our consulting reporting unit had $1.8 billion of goodwill on March 1, 2015, and experienced revenue and operating margin declines in fiscal 2015. As of our most recent annual goodwill impairment review, our consulting reporting unit’s fair value was 16% in excess of its carrying value. We estimate that should our consulting reporting unit’s projected margins and related cash flows unfavorably deviate from our projections by 20% or more, our consulting reporting unit likely would incur a goodwill impairment loss. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal 50 Table of Contents forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from 51 Table of Contents our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of service-based employee stock options, service-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs) and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest. For our service-based awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. For our PSUs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for each separately vesting tranche, as the performance conditions to evaluate attainment of each tranche for each participant are independent of the performance conditions for the other tranches. We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based upon historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that a grantee terminates or the awards vest and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results. Additionally, we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon U.S. treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the implied volatility of publicly traded 52 Table of Contents options in our stock in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification. Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense that we record to vary. We issue PSUs to certain key executives. We estimate the fair values of the PSUs based upon their intrinsic values as of the grant dates as the vesting conditions and related terms of the PSUs were communicated to each participating employee as of their respective grant dates and include attainment metrics that are defined, fixed and consistently determined based upon consistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics and that require the employee to render service. The performance conditions of the PSUs affect the number of PSUs that will ultimately vest and be issued to the grantee based upon a “target” that is subject to certain attainment maximums, with the possibility that none will vest if applicable performance conditions are not met. We update the amount of stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, to record as of the end of each reporting period based on the expected attainment of performance targets, which is subject to change until a final determination is known. Changes to the target estimates are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basis during the reporting period in which the target estimates are altered and may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for such reporting period to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock-based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction, the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid-in capital. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of publicly traded options in our stock, refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates or PSU target performance attainment that differ from our current estimates, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of MICROS in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and Responsys in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was impacted by our acquisitions, primarily our acquisitions of Responsys in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Tekelec in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our operating segments’ revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such 53 Table of Contents acquired products and services. The contributions of our acquisitions to certain of our operating segments’ revenues, margins and expenses for each of the respective period comparisons generally are not provided in our discussions, as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been different; and • although substantially all of our software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware systems support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud SaaS and PaaS deferred revenues, software license updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2014, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2015 and 2014, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.08 million in fiscal 2015 (using 1.08 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.36 million in fiscal 2014 (using 1.36 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2015 results using the fiscal 2014 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 54 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2015 Actual Constant 2014 Actual Constant 2013 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 21,107 4% 6% $ 20,323 3% 4% $ 19,719 EMEA(1) 11,380 -5% 4% 11,946 7% 4% 11,158 Asia Pacific(2) 5,739 -4% 1% 6,006 -5% 2% 6,303 Total revenues 38,226 0% 4% 38,275 3% 4% 37,180 Total Operating Expenses 24,355 4% 7% 23,516 5% 6% 22,496 Total Operating Margin $ 13,871 -6% 0% $ 14,759 1% 1% $ 14,684 Total Operating Margin % 36% 39% 39% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 55% 53% 53% EMEA 30% 31% 30% Asia Pacific 15% 16% 17% Total Revenues by Business: Software and Cloud $ 29,475 1% 5% $ 29,199 5% 5% $ 27,920 Hardware Systems 5,205 -3% 2% 5,372 0% 2% 5,346 Services 3,546 -4% 0% 3,704 -5% -4% 3,914 Total revenues $ 38,226 0% 4% $ 38,275 3% 4% $ 37,180 % Revenues by Business: Software and Cloud 77% 76% 75% Hardware Systems 14% 14% 14% Services 9% 10% 11% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) Asia Pacific includes Japan Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Our results of operations for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 4 percentage points, total operating expenses by 3 percentage points and total operating income by 6 percentage points. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency variations of 4 percentage points, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2015 due to revenue increases in our software and cloud and hardware systems businesses. The constant currency growth in our software and cloud revenues was attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues, growth in our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. The constant currency growth in our hardware systems business was attributable to growth in our hardware systems support revenues, which were primarily attributable to revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 69%, EMEA contributed 28% and Asia Pacific contributed 3% to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2015. Excluding the effects of favorable currency variations of 3 percentage points, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due to expense increases across all of our lines of business, the largest of which were due to increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, and increased acquisition related and other expenses. Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points, our fiscal 2015 operating margin was flat in comparison to the prior year, while our operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased during fiscal 2015 as our total operating expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: On a constant currency basis, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2014 due to increases in our software and cloud business revenues and our hardware systems business revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our services business revenues. The constant currency revenue growth in our 55 Table of Contents software and cloud business was substantially attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and, to a lesser extent, growth in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions. The constant currency revenue growth in our hardware business was due to an increase in our hardware systems support revenues due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions and due to increases in our hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems. On a constant currency basis, the Americas contributed 61%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 9% to our total revenues growth during fiscal 2014. Total constant currency operating expenses increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting from increased headcount, increased sales-based variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth, and increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues. These expense increases in fiscal 2014 were partially offset by lower constant currency expenses in fiscal 2014 from our hardware systems support and services segments due to decreased headcount, lower restructuring expenses, and lower intangible assets amortization. In fiscal 2013, we recognized a $387 million acquisition related benefit related to changes in estimates for contingent consideration payable (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information) and a $306 million benefit relating to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), both of which decreased our acquisition related and other expenses during this period. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our operating margin increased during fiscal 2014 due to our revenues growth, while our operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other significant expense and income items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Cloud software as a service and platform as a service deferred revenues(1) $ 12 $ 17 $ 45 Software license updates and product support deferred revenues(1) 11 3 14 Hardware systems support deferred revenues(1) 4 11 14 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 2,149 2,300 2,385 Acquisition related and other(3)(5) 211 41 (604 ) Restructuring(4) 207 183 352 Stock-based compensation(5) 928 795 722 Income tax effects(6) (971 ) (1,091 ) (896 ) $ 2,551 $ 2,259 $ 2,032 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS subscriptions, software support and hardware systems support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to subscription contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $12 million, $17 million and $45 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We also did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of $4 million, $11 million and $14 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately $4 million of estimated cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2016 that would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $2 million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2016 that would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. Approximately $1 million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware 56 Table of Contents systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2016 that would have otherwise been recognized by certain acquired companies as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2015, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2016 $ 1,624 Fiscal 2017 995 Fiscal 2018 848 Fiscal 2019 742 Fiscal 2020 598 Thereafter 1,599 Total intangible assets, net $ 6,406 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 was a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million (refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). Included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 and 2013 were benefits of $53 million and $306 million, respectively, related to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). Also included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2013 were changes in estimates for contingent consideration payable, which reduced acquisition related and other expenses by $387 million during fiscal 2013 (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). (4) The significant majority of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2015 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan) and our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2013 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily related to costs incurred pursuant to our 2013 Restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (5) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2015 2014 2013 Sales and marketing $ 180 $ 165 $ 137 Cloud software as a service and platform as a service 10 8 10 Cloud infrastructure as a service 5 4 8 Software license updates and product support 21 22 20 Hardware systems products 6 5 3 Hardware systems support 6 6 5 Services 30 29 23 Research and development 522 385 352 General and administrative 148 171 164 Subtotal 928 795 722 Acquisition related and other 5 10 33 Total stock-based compensation $ 933 $ 805 $ 755 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. (6) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 23.6%, 22.5% and 23.0%, respectively, instead of 22.6%, 20.1% and 21.4%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations, due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, primarily the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. 57 Table of Contents Software and Cloud Business Our software and cloud business consists of our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment, our cloud infrastructure as a service segment and our software license updates and product support segment. New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions: New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware and our application software products. Cloud software subscriptions include revenues from our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, which grant customers access to a broad range of our software offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based, cloud computing environment that includes access, hosting, infrastructure management, the use of software updates, and support. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Costs associated with our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment are included in sales and marketing expenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses and amortization of intangible assets. These costs are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software offerings, marketing program costs, the cost of providing our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings and amortization of intangible assets.

In constant currency, fiscal 2015 revenue growth in the Americas region was offset by revenue declines in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues in the amounts of $12 million, $17 million and $45 million that would have 58 Table of Contents been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts over the respective contractual periods. In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater decreased by 15% in fiscal 2015 and represented 31% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2015 in comparison to 33% in fiscal 2014. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses, and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses incurred to support the related revenues increase. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 due to the growth in total expenses for this operating segment. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings resulting from our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues growth in fiscal 2014 in the Americas and EMEA region was partially offset by a decline in revenues in the Asia Pacific region. As described above, the amount of new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were affected by business combination accounting rules. In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater increased by 3% in fiscal 2014 and represented 33% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2014 in comparison to 32% in fiscal 2013. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions expenses increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth, and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses incurred to support the related revenues increase. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2014 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues for this operating segment. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service: Our cloud infrastructure as a service segment provides comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that is hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premises at customer facilities; virtual machine instance services that are subscription-based in which we deploy, secure, provision, manage and maintain certain of our hardware products for our customers to provide them with a set of cloud-based core infrastructure capabilities like elastic compute and storage services to run workloads in the cloud; and hardware and related support offerings for certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems that are deployed in our customers’ data centers for a monthly fee. Cloud infrastructure as a service expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures, technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities costs. For all periods presented, our cloud-infrastructure as a service segment’s revenues and expenses were substantially attributable to our comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and hosting services. 59 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2015 Actual Constant 2014 Actual Constant 2013 Cloud Infastructure as a Service Revenues: Americas $ 444 33% 35% $ 335 -6% -5% $ 355 EMEA 129 37% 41% 94 32% 27% 72 Asia Pacific 35 28% 39% 27 -12% 3% 30 Total revenues 608 33% 36% 456 0% 1% 457 Expenses: Cloud infastructure as a service(1) 339 12% 14% 304 3% 5% 296 Sales and marketing(1) 90 46% 50% 61 0% 1% 61 Stock-based compensation 5 27% 27% 4 -52% -52% 8 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 4 * * — * * — Total expenses 438 19% 21% 369 1% 3% 365 Total Margin $ 170 97% 103% $ 87 -6% -9% $ 92 Total Margin % 28% 19% 20% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 73% 73% 77% EMEA 21% 21% 16% Asia Pacific 6% 6% 7% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation (2) Included as a component of ‘Amortization of Intangible Assets’ in our consolidated statements of operations * Not meaningful Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS revenues increased during fiscal 2015 primarily due to growth in our comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and hosting services and due to revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 70%, EMEA contributed 24% and Asia Pacific contributed 6% to the increase in IaaS revenues during fiscal 2015. On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS expenses increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with increased headcount and increased infrastructure expenses to support our increase in IaaS revenues. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency exchange variances, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2015 as total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses for this operating segment. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS revenues increased slightly in fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental revenues from our on-premises Oracle Engineered Systems subscription offerings. In constant currency, total cloud IaaS revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a decline in revenues in the Americas region. On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS expenses increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with increased headcount, which reduced the total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues for this segment in comparison to fiscal 2013. 60 Table of Contents Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates grant customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 50%, EMEA contributed 36% and Asia Pacific contributed 14% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during fiscal 2015. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed software support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts in the amounts of $11 million, $3 million and $14 million that would have been otherwise recorded by our acquired businesses as independent entities were not recognized in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the support periods, the substantial majority of which are one year in duration. 61 Table of Contents Excluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due to higher employee related expenses and facilities costs associated with increased headcount that was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions, and also increased due to higher bad debt expenses. These fiscal 2015 expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2015 expense decreases related to lower statutory obligation expenses in the jurisdictions in which we operate and lower amortization of intangible assets. In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues for this segment increased during fiscal 2015 as our total revenues for this segment increased at a faster rate than our total expenses for this segment, each during fiscal 2015 and in comparison to fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, software license updates and product support revenues increased in fiscal 2014 for reasons similar to those noted above for our fiscal 2015 revenues increase. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 15% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during fiscal 2014. As described above, the amounts of software license updates and product support revenues that we recognized in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were affected by business combination accounting rules. Excluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, total software license updates and product support expenses during fiscal 2014 decreased slightly due to a modest decrease in headcount and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. Total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal 2014 as our total revenues for this segment increased while our total expenses slightly decreased, each during fiscal 2014 and in comparison to fiscal 2013. Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business consists of our hardware systems products segment and hardware systems support segment.

On a constant currency basis, revenue increases in the Americas region and EMEA region were offset by declines in the Asia Pacific region. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total hardware systems products expenses decreased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower bad debt expenses and a reduction in amortization of intangible assets. These fiscal 2015 expense decreases were partially offset by higher fiscal 2015 employee related expenses due to increased headcount from our recent acquisitions and higher direct product costs that were primarily attributable to higher revenues from recently acquired companies. In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2015 due to the decrease in total expenses for this segment. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware systems products revenues modestly decreased in fiscal 2014. The decrease in revenues during fiscal 2014, which was attributable to reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our product lines, was partially offset by incremental revenues from our acquired companies and increases in hardware revenues attributable to the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems. In constant currency, total hardware systems products expenses increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. 63 Table of Contents Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2014 due to a decrease in our total revenues and increase in our total expenses for this segment.

The Americas region contributed 42%, EMEA contributed 52% and Asia Pacific contributed 6%, to our constant currency growth in hardware systems support revenues during fiscal 2015. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded adjustments to reduce assumed hardware systems support obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts in the amounts of $4 million, $11 million and $14 million were not recognized in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. To the extent these underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over the future support periods. In constant currency, total hardware systems support expenses decreased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by higher employee related expenses resulting from increased headcount from our recent acquisitions, higher external contractor expenses and higher bad debt expenses.

Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation.

Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014 decreased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2013, due to a tax favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our fiscal 2014 earnings and the effects of acquisition related settlements with tax authorities during fiscal 2014. 69 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013 Working capital $ 47,892 42% $ 33,739 17% $ 28,813 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 54,368 40% $ 38,819 20% $ 32,216 Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31, 2014 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior notes during fiscal 2015, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2015, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These working capital increases were partially offset by $6.2 billion of net cash used for our acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $2.0 billion of senior notes due January 2016 from long-term to current, and $2.3 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, all of which occurred during fiscal 2015. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2014 in comparison to May 31, 2013 was primarily due to our issuance of €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2013, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2014, and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These working capital increases were partially offset by the reclassification of $1.5 billion of senior notes due July 2014 from long-term to current, $9.8 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for acquisitions. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31, 2014 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2015, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were partially offset by $6.2 billion of net cash paid for our acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $1.5 billion of senior notes and $2.3 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $42.7 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2015. We consider $38.0 billion of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $11.8 billion as of May 31, 2015 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2015, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2015 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2014 balance sheet date. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2014 in comparison to May 31, 2013 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities, our issuance of €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes in July 2013, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These increases were partially offset by $9.8 billion of repurchases of our common stock, $3.5 billion of net cash paid for acquisitions and $2.2 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31, 2014 decreased on a net basis in comparison to May 31, 2013 due to the modest strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in comparison to certain major international currencies during fiscal 2014. 70 Table of Contents Days sales outstanding, which we calculate by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 47 days at May 31, 2015 compared with 48 days at May 31, 2014. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of revenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware systems support obligations to fair value. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,336 -4% $ 14,921 5% $ 14,224 Net cash used for investing activities $ (19,047 ) 153% $ (7,539 ) 27% $ (5,956 ) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 9,850 342% $ (4,068 ) 52% $ (8,500 ) Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, hardware systems products, hardware systems support arrangements, and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products, taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2015 in comparison to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate variances on our fiscal 2015 net income of 7 percentage points. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the following: the fiscal 2013 non-recurring impacts of a $387 million reduction of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information) and the impact of a $306 million non-current receivable related to certain litigation (refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), both of which increased our net income in fiscal 2013 without the corresponding operating cash flow benefits. These items did not recur during fiscal 2014. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014, each relative to the respective prior year period, primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities). Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 increased in comparison to net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2015 (we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2015 in comparison to €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2014) as well as lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2015. These favorable impacts to our financing cash flows during fiscal 2015 were partially offset by the repayment of $1.5 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities during fiscal 2015 (no repayments during fiscal 2014). Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2014 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the repayment of $3.0 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain expired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 (no repayments during fiscal 2014), a net increase in borrowings during fiscal 2014 (we issued €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 71 Table of Contents 2014 in comparison to $5.0 billion of senior notes issued during fiscal 2013), lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2014 and higher proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2014. These fiscal 2014 cash favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in payments of cash dividends to stockholders in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flows as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,336 -4% $ 14,921 5% $ 14,224 Capital expenditures(1) (1,391 ) 140% (580 ) -11% (650 ) Free cash flow $ 12,945 -10% $ 14,341 6% $ 13,574 Net income $ 9,938 $ 10,955 $ 10,925 Free cash flow as percent of net income 130% 131% 124% (1) Derived from capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities as per our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware systems products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets. We financed $1.6 billion in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2013, or approximately 19%, 17% and 19%, respectively, of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. We financed $172 million, $168 million and $161 million of our hardware systems products revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, or approximately 6% in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014 and 5% in fiscal 2013 of our hardware systems products revenues. Recent Financing Activities: Senior Notes: As of May 31, 2015, we had $42.0 billion of senior notes outstanding ($24.1 billion outstanding as of May 31, 2014). In fiscal 2015, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $1.0 billion of floating rate notes due July 2017 (2017 Notes), $750 million of floating rate notes due October 2019 (2019 Floating Rate Notes), $2.0 billion of 2.25% notes due October 2019 (2019 Notes), $1.5 billion of 2.80% notes due July 2021 (2021 Notes), $2.5 billion of 2.50% notes due May 2022 (2022 Notes), $2.0 billion of 3.40% notes due July 2024 (2024 Notes), $2.5 billion of 2.95% notes due May 2025 (2025 Notes), $500 million of 3.25% notes due May 2030 (2030 Notes), $1.75 billion of 4.30% notes due July 2034 (2034 Notes), $1.25 billion of 3.90% notes due May 2035 (2035 Notes), $1.0 billion of 4.50% notes due July 2044 (2044 Notes), $2.0 billion of 4.125% notes due May 2045 (2045 Notes) and $1.25 billion of 4.375% notes due May 2055 (2055 Notes, and together with the 2017 Notes, 2019 Floating Rate Notes, 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2030 Notes, 2034 Notes, 2035 Notes, 2044 Notes and 2045 Notes, the Senior Notes). We issued the Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness. Additional details regarding our Senior Notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In July 2014, our 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 for $1.5 billion matured and were repaid, and we settled the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with such fixed rate senior notes. 72 Table of Contents Interest Rate Swap Agreements: In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. As of May 31, 2015, our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes had effective interest rates of 0.76% and 0.91%, respectively, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Additional details regarding our Senior Notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2015, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.51 per share that totaled $2.3 billion, an increase of $0.03 per share over the cash dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2014. In June 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of outstanding common stock payable on July 29, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 18, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $13.0 billion. As of May 31, 2015, approximately $9.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program. We repurchased 193.7 million shares for $8.1 billion, 280.4 million shares for $9.8 billion, and 346.1 million shares for $11.0 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below), our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2015: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 42,466 $ 2,000 $ — $ 6,000 $ 2,000 $ 4,500 $ 27,966 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 20,166 1,439 1,334 1,315 1,154 1,083 13,841 Operating leases(2) 1,247 330 270 209 156 107 175 Purchase obligations and other(3) 1,181 713 195 124 85 64 — Total contractual obligations $ 65,060 $ 4,482 $ 1,799 $ 7,648 $ 3,395 $ 5,754 $ 41,982 (1) Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes outstanding as of May 31, 2015. Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes), our 2019 Notes and our 2021 Notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on the January 2019 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using interest rates of 0.93%, 0.76% and 0.91%, respectively, which represented our effective interest rates for these senior notes as of May 31, 2015 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements, and are subject to change in future periods. Our 2017 Notes, our floating rate senior notes due January 2019 and our 2019 Floating Rate Notes bore interest at a rate of 0.47%, 0.86% and 0.78%, respectively, as of May 31, 2015 and interest payments on these notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using this rate. 73 Table of Contents Our 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and our 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes) are denominated in Euro. In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed rate, Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53%. Principal and interest payments for the January 2021 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were calculated based on the terms of the aforementioned cross-currency swap agreements. Principal and interest payments for the July 2025 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2015. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $61 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2015. (3) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. As of May 31, 2015, we had $4.8 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2016. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues (in particular, our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short-term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2016. 74 Table of Contents The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2015 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 8,596 $ 9,598 $ 9,327 $ 10,706 Gross profit $ 6,878 $ 7,657 $ 7,394 $ 8,611 Operating income $ 2,963 $ 3,542 $ 3,383 $ 3,982 Net income $ 2,184 $ 2,502 $ 2,495 $ 2,758 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.49 $ 0.57 $ 0.57 $ 0.63 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.48 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.62 Fiscal 2014 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 8,372 $ 9,275 $ 9,307 $ 11,320 Gross profit $ 6,607 $ 7,420 $ 7,490 $ 9,340 Operating income $ 2,873 $ 3,410 $ 3,567 $ 4,909 Net income $ 2,191 $ 2,553 $ 2,565 $ 3,646 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.48 $ 0.56 $ 0.57 $ 0.81 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.47 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.80 Stock Options and Restricted Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that stock options and restricted stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2012 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 1.9% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock options and restricted stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stock-based awards vest. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2015, which generally have a 10-year exercise period, less than 1.0% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2015, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 10.2%. 75 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of stock-based awards in excess of 100,000 stock option equivalent shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock-based award grants of up to 100,000 stock option equivalent shares to non-executive officers and employees. Stock option and restricted stock-based award activity from June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2015 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2012 425 Stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted 312 Stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed 20 Stock options exercised and restricted stock-based awards vested (250 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (66 ) Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2015 441 Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 89 Weighted average annualized stock repurchases (274 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2015 4,343 Basic weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2015 4,567 Stock options and restricted stock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2015 10.2% In the money stock options and total restricted stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal period presented) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2015 10.1% Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2015 1.9% Weighted average annualized stock options and restricted stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted average shares outstanding from June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2015 -4.0% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to certain employees. These annual stock-based award grants are generally made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2015, substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with approximately 28% having maturity dates within one year and 72% having maturity dates within one to six years (see a description of our marketable securities held in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). We hold a mix of both fixed and floating rate debt securities. Our floating rate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our investments portfolio associated with the risk of rising interest rates. The fair values of our fixed rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates increased by 50 basis points as of May 31, 2015, we estimate the change would decrease the fair 76 Table of Contents values of our marketable securities holdings by $191 million. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2015, total interest income was $349 million with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 0.79% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the approximate fair values of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2015 and 2014. May 31, 2015 2014 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value WeightedAverageInterest Rate Fair Value WeightedAverageInterest Rate Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,716 0.36% $ 17,769 0.37% Marketable securities 32,652 1.07% 21,050 1.14% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 54,368 0.79% $ 38,819 0.79% Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk—Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were $42.0 billion as of May 31, 2015, consisting of $39.7 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $2.3 billion of floating rate borrowings (Floating Rate Notes). During fiscal 2015, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $1.75 billion of floating rate notes and $18.25 billion of fixed rate notes as described in the “Recent Financing Activities” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) in this Annual Report. In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (2019 Notes) and our $1.5 billion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. In July 2013, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes) so that the interest payable on the January 2019 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The total fair value gain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2015 was $74 million. If LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2015, the change would decrease the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $221 million. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. By issuing the Floating Rate Notes and entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. As of May 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate associated with our Floating Rate Notes and January 2019 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, was 0.79%. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2015, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately $73 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating rate borrowings. 77 Table of Contents In July 2014, our 3.75% senior notes due July 2014 for $1.5 billion matured and were repaid, and we settled the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with such fixed rate senior notes. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Risks—Foreign Currency Borrowings and Related Hedges In July 2013, we issued €1.25 billion of 2.25% notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with an annual interest rate of 3.53%. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements match the critical terms of January 2021 Notes, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these cross-currency swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. The fair values of these cross-currency swap agreements as of May 31, 2015 and 2014 were a $(244) million loss and a $74 million gain, respectively. The changes in the fair values of the cross-currency swap agreements during fiscal 2015 were primarily attributable to the decline in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. If the Euro weakened by 10% as of May 31, 2015, we estimate the change would decrease the fair values of the cross-currency swap agreements by $174 million. If interest rates that correspond to the remaining term of the January 2021 Notes decreased by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2015, we estimate the change would decrease the fair values of the cross-currency swap agreements by $91 million. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related cross-currency swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In July 2013, we also issued €750 million of 3.125% notes due July 2025 (2025 Notes). We designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $208 million of net other comprehensive gains for fiscal 2015. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes representing the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income (expense), net. We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2015. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar weakened by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May 31, 2015, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would increase by approximately $81 million. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is 78 Table of Contents not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for a net unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2015 and 2014, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2015 and 2014, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2015 and 2014. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $157 million, $375 million and $162 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were foreign currency remeasurement losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations of $23 million, $213 million and $64 million, respectively (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2015, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2015 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2014. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were decreases of $1.2 billion, $158 million and $110 million, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies that we held as of May 31, 2015: (in millions) U.S. DollarEquivalent atMay 31, 2015 Euro $ 2,190 Japanese Yen 1,143 Indian Rupee 674 Saudi Arabian Riyal 445 Chinese Renminbi 427 Australian Dollar 397 South African Rand 344 Canadian Dollar 231 Other foreign currencies 1,802 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 7,653 79 Table of Contents If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would decrease by approximately $765 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.",2023-12-30 16:56:37.365388
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses, key operating segments and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—application, platform and infrastructure. Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of application, platform, compute and storage services in all three primary layers of the cloud: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Our on-premise offerings include Oracle database and middleware software, application software, hardware (Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking and industry-specific products), and related support and services. We provide our cloud and on-premise offerings to over 400,000 worldwide customers via deployment models that best suit their needs. Our comprehensive and fully integrated stack of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environments and the Oracle Cloud; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners’ cloud services and our customers’ cloud IT environments. In addition to providing a broad spectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our products and services to our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and on-premise IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses. We have a deep understanding as to how all components within IT environments—application, platform and infrastructure—interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to take advantage of our research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle E-Business Suite, Siebel, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products, among others, or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us. As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed on-premise, and both sets of resources can be managed as one. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect these different deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and 40 Table of Contents technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. We have three businesses that deliver our application, platform and infrastructure technologies: cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services. These businesses can be further divided into certain operating segments (Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our operating segments). Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our actual results in U.S. Dollars, we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows. Cloud and On-Premise Software Business Our cloud and on-premise software business, which represented 78%, 77% and 76% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is comprised of three operating segments: (1) cloud software and on-premise software, (2) cloud IaaS and (3) software license updates and product support. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our cloud and on-premise software business’ total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products, expected growth in our cloud and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts, and contributions from our acquisitions, which should allow us to grow and continue to make investments in research and development. Cloud Software and On-Premise Software: Our cloud software and on-premise software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of application and platform technologies through our SaaS and PaaS offerings, which are certain of our software applications and platforms that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment that we host, manage and support, and through the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others. We believe the comprehensiveness and breadth of our SaaS, PaaS and on-premise software offerings provides greater benefit to our customers and differentiates us from many of our competitors that offer more limited or specialized software offerings. Our SaaS and PaaS offerings are designed to be interoperable with one another, thereby limiting the integration and tuning of multiple cloud applications from multiple vendors. Our SaaS and PaaS offerings are designed to deliver secure data isolation and flexible upgrades, self-service access controls for users, a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for integration with on-premise systems, and a high performance, high availability infrastructure based on our infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems. Our on-premise software offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and third-party UNIX products, among others. Our commitment to industry standards results in software offerings that work in customer environments with Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components and that can be adapted to meet specific industry or business needs. We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect cloud and on-premise deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. All of these approaches are designed to support customer choice and reduce customer risk. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We market and sell our software offerings to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit customer needs. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. Our SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software licenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the strategy for and competitive position of our software offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our SaaS and PaaS contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In recent periods, we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, which has affected the growth of our cloud SaaS and 41 Table of Contents PaaS revenues and our new software licenses revenues and the related expenses. We expect these trends will continue. Our SaaS and PaaS arrangements are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. The substantial majority of our new software license transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues. Cloud software and on-premise software revenues represented 25%, 26% and 28% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our cloud software and on-premise software segment’s margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short term. As discussed further below under “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges,” our cloud software and on-premise software segment’s margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations that we assumed in our business combinations and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service: Our cloud IaaS segment, which represented 2% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, and 1% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, provides infrastructure cloud services that are enterprise-grade, hosted and supported within the Oracle Cloud to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services on a subscription basis. Our cloud IaaS segment also offers Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that are hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates and product support revenues are generated through the sale of software support contracts relating to on-premise new software licenses purchased by our customers. Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration. Substantially all of our on-premise software license customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts, (2) the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and (3) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Software license updates and product support revenues, which represented 51%, 49% and 47% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is our highest margin business unit. Our software support margins during fiscal 2016 were 91% and accounted for 86% of our total margins over the same period. Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations and by the amortization of intangible assets, both of which are discussed further below under “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges.” Over the longer term, we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons: • substantially all of our on-premise new software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal; • substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a further increase in our software support contract base. Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat, software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant, since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts, which add to our software support contract base; and 42 Table of Contents • our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base, as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported. Hardware Business Our hardware business is comprised of two operating segments: (1) hardware products and (2) hardware support. Our hardware business represented 13% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016, and 14% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014. We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. Hardware Products: We provide a broad selection of hardware and related services, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, networking, workstations and related devices, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software to support diverse IT environments, including cloud computing environments. We engineer our hardware products with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures. Our hardware products support many of the world’s largest cloud infrastructures, including the Oracle Cloud. Our hardware products are designed to be easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve computing performance relative to our competitors’ offerings. We design our hardware products to seamlessly connect cloud and on-premise IT environments to further enable interoperability, interchangeability and extendibility and to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components. Our flexible and open approach provides Oracle customers with a broad range of choices in how they deploy our hardware products, which we believe is a priority for our customers. Oracle Engineered Systems are core to our hardware offerings and are important elements of our data center and cloud computing offerings including the Oracle Cloud. These pre-integrated products are designed to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance, availability, security and operational efficiency relative to our competitors’ products; to be upgraded effectively and efficiently; and to simplify maintenance cycles by providing a single solution for software patching. Oracle Engineered Systems are tested before they are shipped to customers and delivered ready-to-run, enabling customers to shorten deployment time to production. We offer certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems technologies through flexible deployment options including as a cloud service and for on-premise IT environments. We offer a wide range of server products using our SPARC microprocessor. Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability, security, and scalability. Our mid-size and large servers are designed to offer better performance and lower total cost of ownership than competitive UNIX systems for business critical applications, for customers having more computationally intensive needs, and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments. Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle SuperCluster, one of our Oracle Engineered Systems. We also offer enterprise x86 servers. These x86 servers are based on microprocessors from Intel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Microsoft Windows and other operating systems. Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including the Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Oracle Exalytics In-Memory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance. Our storage products are engineered for the cloud and designed to securely store, manage, protect, archive, backup and recover customers’ mission critical data assets. Our storage products consist of disk, flash, tape, virtual tape and hardware-related software including file systems software, back-up and archive software, hierarchical storage management software and networking for mainframe and heterogeneous systems environments. We also offer certain of our storage offerings as a cloud service. 43 Table of Contents Our networking and data center fabric products, including Oracle Virtual Networking, and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies, are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance, reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity. We offer hardware products and services designed for certain specific industries. Our point-of-sale hardware offerings include point-of-sale terminals and related hardware that are designed for managing businesses within the food and beverage, hotel and retail industries, among others. Our hardware products and services for communications networks include network signaling, policy control and subscriber data management solutions, and session border control technology, among others. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. To produce our hardware products, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage products. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities. We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Our hardware products revenues, cost of hardware products and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware products, the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, our operating margins for our hardware products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets. Our quarterly hardware products revenues are difficult to predict. The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, among other factors, could substantially affect the amount of hardware products revenues, expenses and operating margins that we report. Hardware Support: Our hardware support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Typically, our hardware support contract arrangements are priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees, are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration. We continue to evolve hardware support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware products. Our hardware support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors, including the volume of purchases of hardware products, the pricing and mix of hardware products purchased, whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale, the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions. Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers’ decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available. Our hardware support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting, including fair value adjustments relating to hardware support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets, both of which are discussed further below under “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges.” 44 Table of Contents Services Business Our services business, which represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending, our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues and the growth in our software and hardware offerings. Our services business’ offerings include: • consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our offerings, including IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial software implementation and integration, and ongoing software enhancements and upgrades. We utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners, consisting of on-premise consultants from local geographies, industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers; • advanced customer support services, which are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their Oracle products and services and also include certain other services; and • education services for Oracle products and services, including training and certification programs that are offered to customers, partners and employees through a variety of formats, including instructor-led classes at our education centers, live virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training. Acquisitions A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including MICROS Systems, Inc. (MICROS) in fiscal 2015. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our 45 Table of Contents more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: • Revenue Recognition; • Business Combinations; • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; • Accounting for Income Taxes; and • Legal and Other Contingencies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: • cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: new software licenses, which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database, middleware, applications and industry-specific software products; cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, which grant customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment; cloud IaaS offerings, which grant customers access to infrastructure cloud services to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services, and also provide management services for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure, both generally on a subscription basis; and software license updates and product support offerings (described further below); • hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage products, networking and data center fabric products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and • services revenues, which are earned from providing software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education services. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. 46 Table of Contents Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy (for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option, and the related fees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further below), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elements) Our revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware products revenues, support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. When applicable, we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items. Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. 47 Table of Contents Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Our cloud IaaS offerings provide infrastructure cloud services and also include deployment and management offerings for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure. Our cloud IaaS offerings are generally sold on a subscription basis and revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, networking and industry-specific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements) We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as non-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For our non-software multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. 48 Table of Contents When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Non-software Elements Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Non-software Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and services offerings including new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non-software elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above. Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Non-software Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. 49 Table of Contents Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenues to software and non-software elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. 50 Table of Contents Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, hardware product sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware support obligations assumed. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result of our fair value estimates for these obligations, we did not recognize certain cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations (refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for further discussion). Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware support contracts. To the extent 51 Table of Contents customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 52 Table of Contents but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed on March 1, 2016, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we recognize an impairment charge in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $186 million in our hardware products reporting unit (refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). Other than our consulting reporting unit, all of our other reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment review. Our consulting reporting unit had $1.8 billion of goodwill on March 1, 2016, and experienced revenue and operating margin declines in fiscal 2016. As of our most recent annual goodwill impairment review, our consulting reporting unit’s fair value was 11% in excess of its carrying value. We estimate that should our consulting reporting unit’s projected margins and related cash flows unfavorably deviate from our projections by 20% or more each year, our consulting reporting unit likely would incur a goodwill impairment loss. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. 53 Table of Contents We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As 54 Table of Contents additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was impacted by our recent acquisitions. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our operating segments’ revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. Expenses for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and • although substantially all of our on-premise software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud SaaS and PaaS deferred revenues, software license updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware support deferred revenues in our “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our segments’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each segment’s revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2015, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2016 and 2015, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.12 million in fiscal 2016 (using 1.12 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.08 million in fiscal 2015 (using 1.08 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2016 results using the fiscal 2015 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 55 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2016 Actual Constant 2015 Actual Constant 2014 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 20,466 -3% 0% $ 21,107 4% 6% $ 20,323 EMEA(1) 10,881 -4% 3% 11,380 -5% 4% 11,946 Asia Pacific(2) 5,700 -1% 7% 5,739 -4% 1% 6,006 Total revenues 37,047 -3% 2% 38,226 0% 4% 38,275 Total Operating Expenses 24,443 0% 4% 24,355 4% 7% 23,516 Total Operating Margin $ 12,604 -9% -2% $ 13,871 -6% 0% $ 14,759 Total Operating Margin % 34% 36% 39% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 55% 55% 53% EMEA 29% 30% 31% Asia Pacific 16% 15% 16% Total Revenues by Business: Cloud and on-premise software $ 28,990 -2% 3% $ 29,475 1% 5% $ 29,199 Hardware 4,668 -10% -5% 5,205 -3% 2% 5,372 Services 3,389 -4% 2% 3,546 -4% 0% 3,704 Total revenues $ 37,047 -3% 2% $ 38,226 0% 4% $ 38,275 % Revenues by Business: Cloud and on-premise software 78% 77% 76% Hardware 13% 14% 14% Services 9% 9% 10% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) The Asia Pacific region includes Japan Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points, total operating expenses by 4 percentage points and total operating margin by 7 percentage points. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software business revenues and services business revenues. The constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software business revenues during fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues, growth in our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions and was partially offset by fiscal 2016 decreases in our new software licenses revenues. The constant currency growth in our services business revenues was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions. These constant currency increases in our revenues during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by constant currency decreases in our hardware business revenues. In constant currency, the EMEA region and the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately equal amounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas was flat. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, higher restructuring expenses that were recorded pursuant to the Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan; see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), and higher general and administrative expenses due to higher headcount and higher professional services fees, primarily legal related fees. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses, which primarily was attributable to higher expenses during fiscal 2015 as a result of a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). 56 Table of Contents Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Our results of operations for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 4 percentage points, total operating expenses by 3 percentage points and total operating income by 6 percentage points. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency variations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2015 due to revenue increases in our cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses. The constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software revenues was attributable to similar reasons as noted above. The constant currency growth in our hardware business was attributable to growth in our hardware support revenues, which were primarily attributable to revenue contributions from our acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas region contributed 69%, the EMEA region contributed 28% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 3% to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2015. Excluding the effects of favorable currency variations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due to expense increases across all of our lines of business, the largest of which were due to increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues, and increased acquisition related and other expenses that was primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment charge as noted above. Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, our fiscal 2015 operating margin was flat in comparison to the prior year, while our operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 as our total operating expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other expense and income items: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Cloud software as a service and platform as a service deferred revenues(1) $ 7 $ 12 $ 17 Software license updates and product support deferred revenues(1) 2 11 3 Hardware support deferred revenues(1) 1 4 11 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 1,638 2,149 2,300 Acquisition related and other(3)(5) 42 211 41 Restructuring(4) 458 207 183 Stock-based compensation(5) 1,034 928 795 Income tax effects(6) (846 ) (971 ) (1,091 ) $ 2,336 $ 2,551 $ 2,259 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS subscriptions, software support and hardware support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud SaaS and PaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. 57 Table of Contents (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2016, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2017 $ 1,026 Fiscal 2018 878 Fiscal 2019 770 Fiscal 2020 621 Fiscal 2021 476 Thereafter 1,172 Total intangible assets, net $ 4,943 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 was a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). (4) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2016 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our 2015 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2015 primarily related to costs incurred pursuant to our 2015 Restructuring Plan and our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2013 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2014 primarily related to costs incurred pursuant to our 2013 Restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (5) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2016 2015 2014 Sales and marketing $ 220 $ 180 $ 165 Cloud software as a service and platform as a service 17 10 8 Cloud infrastructure as a service 4 5 4 Software license updates and product support 23 21 22 Hardware products 7 6 5 Hardware support 5 6 6 Services 29 30 29 Research and development 609 522 385 General and administrative 120 148 171 Subtotal 1,034 928 795 Acquisition related and other 3 5 10 Total stock-based compensation $ 1,037 $ 933 $ 805 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. (6) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 23.2%, 23.6% and 22.5%, respectively, instead of 22.2%, 22.6% and 20.1%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. Cloud and On-Premise Software Business Our cloud and on-premise software business consists of our cloud software and on-premise software segment, our cloud IaaS segment and our software license updates and product support segment. Cloud Software and On-Premise Software: Our cloud software and on-premise software segment engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our cloud software offerings, including our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, and the licensing of our software for on-premise IT environments. Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings grant customers access to a broad range of our application and platform software technologies on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based, cloud computing environment that generally includes access, hosting, infrastructure 58 Table of Contents management, the use of software updates, and support. New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database and middleware and our application software products within on-premise IT environments. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our products through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud software and on-premise software segment are included in sales and marketing expenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses and amortization of intangible assets. These costs are largely personnel related and include commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our software offerings, marketing program costs, the cost of providing our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings and amortization of intangible assets.

The increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and decrease in our new software licenses revenues during fiscal 2016 were primarily due to the strategic emphasis placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud software offerings and we expect these revenue trends will continue. In constant currency, fiscal 2016 revenue declines in the Americas region were partially offset by revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater decreased by 24% in fiscal 2016 and represented 28% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2016 in comparison to 31% in fiscal 2015. 59 Table of Contents Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total cloud software and on-premise software expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses incurred to support the related revenues increase. These fiscal 2016 constant currency expense increases were partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our cloud software and on-premise software segment’s total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 due primarily to growth in our total expenses for this operating segment. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, cloud software and on-premise software revenues were flat during fiscal 2015 as growth in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and contributions from our acquisitions were offset by a decline in our new software licenses revenues. Similar to the fiscal 2016 trend noted above, the increase in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and decrease in our new software licenses revenues during fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the strategic emphasis placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud software offerings. In constant currency, fiscal 2015 revenue growth in the Americas region was offset by revenue declines in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In reported currency, new software licenses revenues earned from transactions of $3 million or greater decreased by 15% in fiscal 2015 and represented 31% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2015 in comparison to 33% in fiscal 2014. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total cloud software and on-premise software expenses increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher employee related expenses from increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses, and higher cloud SaaS and PaaS expenses incurred to support the related revenues increase. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our cloud software and on-premise software segment’s total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 due primarily to the growth in our total expenses during fiscal 2015 for this operating segment. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service: Our cloud IaaS segment provides infrastructure cloud services that are enterprise-grade, hosted and supported within the Oracle Cloud to perform elastic compute, storage and networking services on a subscription basis. Our cloud IaaS segment also offers Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that are hosted at our Oracle data center facilities, select partner data centers or physically on-premise at customer facilities. Cloud IaaS expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures, technology infrastructure expenditures and facilities costs. Operating expenses associated with our IaaS offerings also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related, and amortization of intangible assets. For all periods presented, our cloud IaaS segment’s revenues and expenses were substantially attributable to our Oracle Managed Cloud Services offerings. 60 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2016 Actual Constant 2015 Actual Constant 2014 Cloud Infrastructure as a Service Revenues: Americas $ 470 6% 9% $ 444 33% 35% $ 335 EMEA 139 7% 14% 129 37% 41% 94 Asia Pacific 37 7% 21% 35 28% 39% 27 Total revenues 646 6% 11% 608 33% 36% 456 Expenses: Cloud infrastructure as a service(1) 362 6% 10% 339 12% 14% 304 Sales and marketing(1) 76 -16% -14% 90 46% 50% 61 Stock-based compensation 5 -2% -2% 5 27% 27% 4 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 5 34% 34% 4 * * — Total expenses 448 2% 5% 438 19% 21% 369 Total Margin $ 198 17% 24% $ 170 97% 103% $ 87 Total Margin % 31% 28% 19% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 73% 73% 73% EMEA 21% 21% 21% Asia Pacific 6% 6% 6% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation (2) Included as a component of ‘Amortization of Intangible Assets’ in our consolidated statements of operations * Not meaningful Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total cloud IaaS revenues increased during fiscal 2016 due to growth in our Oracle Managed Cloud Services offerings and incremental revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas region contributed 62%, the EMEA region contributed 27% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 11% to the increase in cloud IaaS revenues during fiscal 2016. On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased infrastructure expenses to support our increase in cloud IaaS revenues. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency exchange variances, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2016 as total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses for this operating segment. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS revenues increased during fiscal 2015 primarily due to contributions from our acquisitions. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas region contributed 70%, the EMEA region contributed 24% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 6% to the increase in cloud IaaS revenues during fiscal 2015. On a constant currency basis, total cloud IaaS expenses increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with increased headcount and increased infrastructure expenses to support our increase in IaaS revenues. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency exchange variances, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2015 as total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses for this operating segment. Software License Updates and Product Support: Software license updates and product support revenues are typically generated through the sale of software support contracts related to on-premise new software licenses purchased by our customers. Our software license updates and product support offerings include software license updates, which grant on-premise software customers rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the support period, and product support including internet access to 61 Table of Contents technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in our global support centers. Expenses associated with our software license updates and product support line of business include the cost of providing the support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets associated with software support contracts and customer relationships obtained from acquisitions.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas region contributed 56%, the EMEA region contributed 26% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 18% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during fiscal 2016. Excluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 3 percentage points, total software license updates and product support expenses decreased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to the growth in total revenues and the decrease in total expenses for this segment. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, software license updates and product support revenues increased during fiscal 2015 relative to fiscal 2014 due to similar reasons as noted above for the fiscal 2016 increase. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas region contributed 50%, the EMEA region contributed 36% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 14% to the increase in software license updates and product support revenues during fiscal 2015. Excluding the effects of favorable foreign currency rate fluctuations of 3 percentage points, total software license updates and product support expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due to higher employee related expenses and facilities costs associated with increased headcount that was primarily attributable to acquisitions, and also due to 62 Table of Contents higher bad debt expenses. These fiscal 2015 expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2015 expense decreases related to lower statutory obligation expenses in the jurisdictions in which we operate and lower amortization of intangible assets. In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues for this segment increased in fiscal 2015 as our total revenues increased at a faster rate than our total expenses for this segment. Hardware Business Our hardware business consists of our hardware products segment and hardware support segment. Hardware Products: Hardware products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage, networking, workstations and related devices and industry-specific hardware products. We market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force and indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware products include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.

This decrease was partially offset by incremental revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from our recently acquired companies, primarily MICROS. On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2016 total hardware products revenues declines in the Americas and EMEA regions were partially offset by slight growth in the Asia Pacific region. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points, total hardware products expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 due to lower hardware products costs associated with lower hardware products revenues, and due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 for this segment due to the decrease in our total revenues. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total hardware products revenues were flat in fiscal 2015 as revenues from acquired companies, including MICROS, and increases in hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems products were offset by reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our other hardware product offerings. On a constant currency basis, revenue increases in the Americas and EMEA regions were offset by revenue declines in the Asia Pacific region during fiscal 2015. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, total hardware products expenses decreased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower bad debt expenses and a reduction in amortization of intangible assets. These fiscal 2015 expense decreases were partially offset by higher fiscal 2015 employee related expenses due to increased headcount from our acquisitions and higher direct product costs that were primarily attributable to acquired products revenues. In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2015 due to the decrease in total expenses for this segment. Hardware Support: Our hardware support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Expenses associated with our hardware support operating segment include the cost of materials used to repair customer products, the cost of providing support services, largely personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our intangible assets primarily associated with hardware support contracts and customer relationships obtained from our acquisitions. 64 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2016 Actual Constant 2015 Actual Constant 2014 Hardware Support Revenues: Americas $ 1,163 -7% -4% $ 1,245 1% 3% $ 1,229 EMEA 656 -9% -1% 722 -2% 6% 738 Asia Pacific 378 -9% -1% 413 -4% 1% 429 Total revenues 2,197 -8% -3% 2,380 -1% 4% 2,396 Expenses: Hardware support(1) 688 -15% -10% 810 -2% 2% 830 Stock-based compensation 5 -17% -17% 6 3% 3% 6 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 146 -8% -8% 158 -32% -32% 231 Total expenses 839 -14% -10% 974 -9% -6% 1,067 Total Margin $ 1,358 -3% 3% $ 1,406 6% 11% $ 1,329 Total Margin % 62% 59% 55% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 53% 52% 51% EMEA 30% 30% 31% Asia Pacific 17% 18% 18% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation (2) Included as a component of ‘Amortization of Intangible Assets’ in our consolidated statements of operations Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, hardware support revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 due to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines for which we offer hardware support. This decrease was partially offset by incremental revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 that were primarily related to our acquisition of MICROS. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in total hardware support revenues was attributable to revenue declines in all regions during fiscal 2016. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, total hardware support expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to reductions in employee related and other expenses from reduced headcount and reduced external contractor costs as we integrated MICROS into our operations, due to a decrease in bad debt expenses, and due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal 2016. In constant currency, total hardware support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to the total expense reductions for this segment. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, hardware support revenues increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to incremental revenues from acquired companies, primarily MICROS. The Americas region contributed 42%, the EMEA region contributed 52% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 6% to the increase in hardware support revenues during fiscal 2015. In constant currency, total hardware support expenses decreased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by higher employee related expenses resulting from increased headcount from our acquisitions, higher external contractor expenses and higher bad debt expenses. In constant currency, total hardware support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2015 due to the increase in total revenues and decrease in total expenses for this operating segment. 65 Table of Contents Services Business Our services business consists of consulting, advanced customer support services and education services.

In constant currency, the Americas contributed 44%, EMEA contributed 44% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the fiscal 2016 growth in our total services revenues. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, our total services expenses declined slightly in fiscal 2016 due to reduced expenses in our consulting and education segments, which were partially offset by modest expense growth in our advanced customer services segment primarily due to our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to the increase in total revenues and decrease in total expenses. 66 Table of Contents Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues were flat in fiscal 2015 as incremental revenues from acquired companies, including MICROS, and an increase in fiscal 2015 advanced customer services revenues were offset by declines in our fiscal 2015 consulting and education revenues. In constant currency, revenues growth in the EMEA region was offset by revenue declines in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions during fiscal 2015. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total services expenses increased during fiscal 2015 due to higher employee related expenses resulting from increased headcount from our acquisitions and were partially offset by lower variable compensation and lower external contractor costs. In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 due to the increase in total expenses for this business.

Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets are acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances.

Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, stock-based compensation expenses, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.

We also recorded an acquisition related benefit of $19 million and a litigation related benefit of $53 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, which reduced our expenses in those periods. Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively.

We also issued $10.0 billion of senior notes in July 2014, which also contributed to additional interest expense during fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015. These increases in interest expense during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by reductions in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repayment of $2.0 billion of senior notes in January 2016. Interest expense was also reduced in fiscal 2016 by the maturity and repayment of $1.5 billion of senior notes and the related fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in July 2014. See Recent Financing Activities below and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our borrowings. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in May 2015 and $10.0 billion of senior notes in July 2014. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2015 was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense during fiscal 2015 resulting from the maturity and repayment of $1.5 billion of senior notes and the related fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in July 2014. Non-Operating Income (Expense), net: Non-operating income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses), including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net in fiscal 2015 increased due to lower net foreign currency losses and due to higher interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances. Included in foreign currency losses, net in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were remeasurement losses of $23 million and $213 million, respectively, related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report contains additional information regarding the foreign currency remeasurement losses we incurred in all periods related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. 69 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2016 Actual Constant 2015 Actual Constant 2014 Provision for income taxes $ 2,541 -12% -5% $ 2,896 5% 13% $ 2,749 Effective tax rate 22.2% 22.6% 20.1% Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 decreased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015, due in substantial part to lower net income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2016, settlements with certain tax authorities, and the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit, which collectively were partially offset by unfavorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings during fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015 increased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014, due in substantial part to an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our fiscal 2015 earnings, and due to the effects of acquisition related settlements with tax authorities in fiscal 2014 that were not present in fiscal 2015, which together were partially offset by lower fiscal 2015 income before provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Working capital $ 47,105 -2% $ 47,892 42% $ 33,739 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 56,125 3% $ 54,368 40% $ 38,819 Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was primarily due to $10.4 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, $2.5 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and $1.2 billion of cash used for capital expenditures. These unfavorable working capital movements were partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2016 and cash proceeds from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises. The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31, 2014 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior notes during fiscal 2015, the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2015 and, to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These working capital increases were partially offset by $6.2 billion of net cash used for our acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $2.0 billion of senior notes that were due in January 2016 from long-term to current, and $2.3 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, all of which occurred during fiscal 2015. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. 70 Table of Contents Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2016, $1.8 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflows from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises. These fiscal 2016 cash inflows were partially offset by fiscal 2016 cash outflows of $10.4 billion for repurchases of our common stock, $2.5 billion for the fiscal 2016 payment of cash dividends to our stockholders, and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016 capital expenditures. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $48.2 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2016. We consider $42.6 billion of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $13.3 billion as of May 31, 2016 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2016, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2016 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2015 balance sheet date. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2015 in comparison to May 31, 2014 was due to an increase in cash generated from our fiscal 2015 operating activities, our issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2015, and to a lesser extent, cash proceeds from fiscal 2015 stock option exercises. These fiscal 2015 cash inflows were partially offset by fiscal 2015 cash outflows of $6.2 billion of net cash paid for our acquisitions of MICROS and others, $8.1 billion of fiscal 2015 repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $1.5 billion of senior notes and $2.3 billion used for the payment of fiscal 2015 cash dividends to our stockholders. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31, 2015 decreased on a net basis in comparison to May 31, 2014 as the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2015. Days sales outstanding, which we calculate by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 46 days at May 31, 2016 compared with 47 days at May 31, 2015. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of any revenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware support obligations to fair value.

Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses, cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support arrangements, and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased facilities. 71 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of lower net income and the related unfavorable currency rate fluctuations on our net income in each fiscal year relative to the corresponding prior year period. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2015 relative to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities). Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: We used net cash for financing activities of $9.9 billion during fiscal 2016 in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of $9.9 billion during fiscal 2015. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 was primarily due to cash outflows of $10.4 billion for fiscal 2016 common stock repurchases and $2.5 billion for fiscal 2016 dividend payments, partially offset by $1.8 billion of cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances, net of repayments. Cash provided by financing activities of $9.9 billion during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $18.3 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2015 debt issuances, net of repayments, partially offset by $8.1 billion of cash used for fiscal 2015 common stock repurchases and $2.3 billion of cash used for fiscal 2015 dividend payments. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 increased in comparison to net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2015 as well as lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2015. These favorable impacts to our financing cash flows during fiscal 2015 were partially offset by the repayment of $1.5 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities during fiscal 2015 (no repayments during fiscal 2014). Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,561 -5% $ 14,336 -4% $ 14,921 Capital expenditures (1,189 ) -15% (1,391 ) 140% (580 ) Free cash flow $ 12,372 -4% $ 12,945 -10% $ 14,341 Net income $ 8,901 $ 9,938 $ 10,955 Free cash flow as percent of net income 139% 130% 131% 72 Table of Contents Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016, and $1.6 billion in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, or approximately 16%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. We financed $159 million, $172 million and $168 million of our hardware products revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or approximately 6% in each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 of our hardware products revenues. Recent Financing Activities: Revolving Credit Agreement: In May 2016, we entered into three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2016 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2016 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2016 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula or (2) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2016 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 27, 2016, which is the termination date of the 2016 Credit Agreements. Additional details regarding the 2016 Credit Agreements are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Senior Notes: In January 2016, our $2.0 billion 5.25% senior notes due January 2016 matured and were repaid. Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2016, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.60 per share that totaled $2.5 billion. In June 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 27, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2016. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 15, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2016, approximately $8.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 271.9 million shares for $10.4 billion, 193.7 million shares for $8.1 billion, and 280.4 million shares for $9.8 billion in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below) or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. 73 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2016: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 44,241 $ 3,750 $ 6,000 $ 2,000 $ 4,500 $ 2,655 $ 25,336 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 19,756 1,337 1,315 1,154 1,083 1,010 13,857 Operating leases(2) 1,238 328 273 211 152 110 164 Purchase obligations and other(3) 894 574 153 91 68 8 — Total contractual obligations $ 66,129 $ 5,989 $ 7,741 $ 3,456 $ 5,803 $ 3,783 $ 39,357 (1) Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2016 after considering: • certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and are subject to change in future periods; • interest payments on our floating-rate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior notes as of May 31, 2016 and are subject to change in future periods; and • certain cross-currency swap agreements for a series of our Euro denominated senior notes that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements. Principal and interest payments for our other Euro-denominated senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2016 and are subject to change in future periods. Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable and other borrowings and related derivative agreements. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $54 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2016. (3) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. In June 2016, we acquired certain companies to expand our cloud industry solutions offerings. These acquisitions were not individually significant. In the aggregate, the estimated total preliminary purchase price was $1.3 billion. As of May 31, 2016, we had $5.3 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2017. 74 Table of Contents We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloud software and on-premise software segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2017. The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2016 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 29 May 31 Revenues $ 8,448 $ 8,993 $ 9,012 $ 10,594 Gross profit $ 6,561 $ 7,105 $ 7,139 $ 8,640 Operating income $ 2,654 $ 2,955 $ 3,027 $ 3,968 Net income $ 1,747 $ 2,197 $ 2,142 $ 2,814 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.40 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 $ 0.68 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.40 $ 0.51 $ 0.50 $ 0.66 Fiscal 2015 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 8,596 $ 9,598 $ 9,327 $ 10,706 Gross profit $ 6,878 $ 7,657 $ 7,394 $ 8,611 Operating income $ 2,963 $ 3,542 $ 3,383 $ 3,982 Net income $ 2,184 $ 2,502 $ 2,495 $ 2,758 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.49 $ 0.57 $ 0.57 $ 0.63 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.48 $ 0.56 $ 0.56 $ 0.62 Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. 75 Table of Contents We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2013 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.6% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards or stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2016, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, 13.3% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future, as we may use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2016, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 10.3%. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of stock-based awards in excess of 100,000 stock option equivalent shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approves individual stock-based award grants of up to 100,000 stock option equivalent shares to non-executive officers and employees. Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2013 448 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted 252 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed 12 Restricted stock-based awards vested and stock options exercised (226 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (59 ) Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2016 427 Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 68 Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases (249 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2016 4,131 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016 4,384 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2016 10.3% Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2016) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2016 9.1% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016 1.6% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016 -4.1% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to certain employees. These annual stock-based award grants are generally made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. 76 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2016, substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with approximately 28% having maturity dates within one year and 72% having maturity dates within one to six years (a description of our marketable securities held is included in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). We hold a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31, 2016, we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $282 million. Our floating-rate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our investments portfolio associated with the risk of rising interest rates. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2016, total interest income was $538 million with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.16% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the approximate fair values of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weighted-average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2016 and 2015. May 31, 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value Weighted-AverageInterestRate Fair Value Weighted-AverageInterestRate Cash and cash equivalents $ 20,152 0.35% $ 21,716 0.36% Marketable securities 35,973 1.62% 32,652 1.07% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 56,125 1.16% $ 54,368 0.79% Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk—Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were $43.9 billion as of May 31, 2016, consisting of $37.8 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $2.3 billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings under a revolving credit agreement (Short-Term Borrowings). 77 Table of Contents We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes), our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), and our $1.5 billion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes, and July 2021 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed-rate borrowings for trading purposes. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The total fair value gain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2016 was $122 million. If LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2016, the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $185 million. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. By issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and the Short-Term Borrowings, and by entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. As of May 31, 2016, the weighted-average interest rate associated with our Floating-Rate Notes, Short-Term Borrowings and January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes, after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, was 1.14%. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2016, if LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately $76 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income (expense), net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. 78 Table of Contents We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2016 and 2015. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $110 million, $157 million and $375 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were foreign currency remeasurement losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations of $7 million, $23 million and $213 million, respectively (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information). As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2016, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2016 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2015. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were decreases of $115 million, $1.2 billion and $158 million, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies that we held as of May 31, 2016: (in millions) U.S. DollarEquivalent atMay 31, 2016 Euro $ 2,430 Japanese Yen 618 Indian Rupee 493 Chinese Renminbi 442 Canadian Dollar 369 British Pound 262 Swiss Franc 191 Australian Dollar 184 Other foreign currencies 1,806 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 6,795 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $680 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. 79 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Net Investment Hedge In July 2013, we issued €750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes). We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, provided there is no ineffectiveness related to the hedge, the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $25 million of net other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2016. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the July 2025 Notes representing any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income (expense), net. We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2016. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the July 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May 31, 2016, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the July 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased by approximately $84 million.",2023-12-30 16:56:36.990630

Our on-premise IT offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware software, among others; hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others; and related support and services. We provide our cloud and on-premise offerings to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best suit customer needs. Our comprehensive and fully integrated stack of Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environments and the Oracle Cloud; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners’ cloud services and our customers’ cloud IT environments. In addition to providing a broad spectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our applications, platform and infrastructure products and services to our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and on-premise IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses. We have a deep understanding as to how applications, platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another within IT environments. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings for their on-premise deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and/or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us. As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT instances are deployed using the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT instances are deployed using Oracle on-premise offerings, and both instances are designed with capabilities to be manageable as one. Our Oracle Cloud at Customer program provides another deployment option that utilizes the Oracle Cloud Machine and Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Machine to bring certain Oracle Cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings to a customer’s on-premise IT environment to meet data sovereignty, data residency, data protection and regulatory business policy requirements, among others, while benefiting from many advantages of a cloud service. 41 Table of Contents A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. On November 7, 2016, we acquired NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite). Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our acquisition of NetSuite. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. To address this demand, we have increased our investment in and focus on the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based applications, platform and infrastructure technologies resulting in higher growth of our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues as customer preferences have pivoted to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and as customers migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing on-premise workloads. We expect these trends to continue. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models. We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT deployment model at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. We have three businesses: cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services, each of which comprises a single operating segment. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view the operating results of our three businesses and allocate resources in a manner that is consistent with the changing market dynamics that we have experienced in recent periods. As a result, during fiscal 2017, we updated our operating segments. The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented below provides the current view that is utilized by our CODMs to evaluate performance and determine resource allocations. In addition to the discussion below, Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provides additional information related to our businesses and operating segments, including the recasting of our segments’ financial information from prior periods to conform to the current year’s presentation. Cloud and On-Premise Software Business Our cloud and on-premise software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and on-premise software offerings. Our cloud and on-premise software revenues represented 80%, 78% and 77% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver applications, platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for on-premise, cloud-based, or hybrid IT infrastructure for a stated period. Our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS arrangements are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal. We offer customers the ability to license our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others, for on-premise and other IT environments. Our new software license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues, which is different than the typical revenue recognition for our cloud-based offerings for which revenues are generally recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. New software license customers have the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts, which grant rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software 42 Table of Contents license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and are generally billed in advance of the service being performed. Our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and new software licenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our cloud contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In recent periods, we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, which represented 12%, 8% and 6% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This emphasis has affected the growth of our new software licenses revenues, and to a lesser extent, has also affected the growth of our software license updates and product support revenues. We expect these trends will continue with the mix of revenues continuing to shift toward cloud-based services for this business. Our software license updates and product support revenues growth is primarily influenced by four factors: (1) the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts; (2) the pricing of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses; (3) the pricing of new software licenses sold; and (4) the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired. Substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they acquire on-premise new software licenses and renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually in order to benefit from Oracle’s research and development investments that are utilized as a part of periodic software updates that are released and that customers with current software support contracts are entitled to. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and on-premise software revenues generally will continue to increase due to: • expected growth in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings; • continued demand for our on-premise software products and software license updates and product support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts; and • contributions from our acquisitions. We believe all of these factors should contribute to growing our cloud and on-premise software revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development. Our cloud and on-premise software business’ segment margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. Hardware Business Our hardware business represented 11%, 13% and 14% of our total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our hardware business provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, management software and related hardware services including hardware support. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees. We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. 43 Table of Contents Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by: our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware products; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; certain of our acquisitions; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Services Business Our services business helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced support services and education services and represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our services business has lower segment margins than our cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services, certain of our acquisitions, general economic conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments, tighter controls over discretionary spending, our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues, and customer demand for our cloud and on-premise software and hardware offerings. Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including NetSuite in fiscal 2017 and MICROS in fiscal 2015. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: • Revenue Recognition; • Business Combinations; 44 Table of Contents • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; • Accounting for Income Taxes; and • Legal and Other Contingencies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: • cloud and on-premise software revenues, which include the sale of: cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, which generally grant customers access to a broad range of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies and related support and services offerings on a subscription basis in a secure, standards-based cloud computing environment; new software licenses, which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database, middleware, applications and industry-specific software products; and software license updates and product support offerings (described further below); • hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues (described further below); and • services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud, software and hardware related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education services. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elements) Our revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverables including cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, hardware products revenues, hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. Our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software and/or infrastructure within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage, host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis. Our cloud IaaS offerings also include deployment and management services for software and hardware related IT infrastructure. Revenues for our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. 45 Table of Contents Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements) We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as non-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For our non-software multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support, based on the renewal rates offered to customers. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices including discounting, margin objectives, competition, contractually stated prices, the geographies in which we offer our products and services, the type of customer (i.e., distributor, value-added reseller, government agency and direct end user, among others) and the stage of the product lifecycle. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management, taking into consideration our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. As our, or our competitors’, pricing and go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, 46 Table of Contents which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period. Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices. Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services (Software Elements) New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware, applications and industry-specific software products and exclude cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates, which are included in software license updates and product support revenues. The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, we recognize new software licenses revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy (for example, in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law, or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in nature), we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory (for example, acceptance provisions that are long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement), revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option, and the related fees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support includes internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Software Products, Software Support and Software Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase software related products, software support and software related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). Such software related multiple-element arrangements include the sale of our software products, software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements. For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license. We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple-element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE—described further above), with any remaining amount allocated to the software license. 47 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Non-software Elements Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Non-software Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and services offerings including new software licenses, software license updates and product support, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non-software elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. In addition, we allocate the consideration within the non-software group to each respective element within that group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software group of elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below. Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Non-software Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed” fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and non-software products and services. We offer these advanced support services, both on-premise and remote, to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services. Depending upon the nature of the arrangement, revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period, which is generally one year or less. Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our cloud, software and hardware products. Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered. If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then new software licenses revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. 48 Table of Contents We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the software or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and license economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Software license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part 49 Table of Contents on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from assumed cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, software support contracts and hardware support contracts for which our future expected cash flow estimates include estimated cash flow amounts and time periods over which such cash flows are expected to be received, estimated retention and renewal rates of existing customer contracts assumed as a part of the acquisition, and estimated costs to sell, market, deliver and support such assumed contracts, among other estimates; • future expected cash flows from acquired developed technology including estimated amounts to be received for such developed technology and the time period over which such cash flows are expected to be received, among other estimates; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware support obligations assumed as part of an acquisition. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling these assumed obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the assumed obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result of our fair value estimates for these obligations, we did not recognize certain cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations (refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for further discussion). Historically, substantially all of our customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts and hardware support contracts when they are eligible for renewal. To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in 50 Table of Contents order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two-step impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment as of March 1, 2017 prior to our operating segment changes. We also subsequently performed a goodwill impairment test after such changes had been effected. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any goodwill impairment charges, nor did we recognize any impairment charges in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $186 million related to our hardware business. All of our reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment review. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. 51 Table of Contents Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe that the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. Beginning in fiscal 2017 (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our fiscal 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting), the impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized to our consolidated statements of operations in the period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in this period. Such detriment/benefit can materially impact our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and prospective periods. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed 52 Table of Contents returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Results of Operations Impacts of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was impacted by our recent acquisitions. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our businesses’ revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also 53 Table of Contents provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and • although substantially all of our on-premise software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts and hardware support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS deferred revenues, software license updates and product support deferred revenues, and hardware support deferred revenues in our “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information In our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP based discussion for substantially all of the other expense items described below that are not directly attributable to our operating segments. In addition, we discuss below the results of each our three businesses—cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services—which also are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three operating segments that is presented in the results of operations discussion below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three operating segments. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each operating segment in the discussion below. Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation includes revenues related to cloud and on-premise software and hardware contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total segment revenues as presented below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented. In addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our businesses including such items and/or it is impractical to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented. 54 Table of Contents Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2016, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2017 and 2016, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.11 million in fiscal 2017 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.12 million in fiscal 2016 (using 1.12 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2017 results using the fiscal 2016 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2017 Actual Constant 2016 Actual Constant 2015 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 21,038 3% 3% $ 20,466 -3% 0% $ 21,107 EMEA(1) 10,630 -2% 2% 10,881 -4% 3% 11,380 Asia Pacific(2) 6,060 6% 4% 5,700 -1% 7% 5,739 Total revenues 37,728 2% 3% 37,047 -3% 2% 38,226 Total Operating Expenses 25,018 2% 3% 24,443 0% 4% 24,355 Total Operating Margin $ 12,710 1% 2% $ 12,604 -9% -2% $ 13,871 Total Operating Margin % 34% 34% 36% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 56% 55% 55% EMEA 28% 29% 30% Asia Pacific 16% 16% 15% Total Revenues by Business: Cloud and on-premise software $ 30,218 4% 5% $ 28,990 -2% 3% $ 29,475 Hardware 4,152 -11% -10% 4,668 -10% -5% 5,205 Services 3,358 -1% 1% 3,389 -4% 2% 3,546 Total revenues $ 37,728 2% 3% $ 37,047 -3% 2% $ 38,226 % Revenues by Business: Cloud and on-premise software 80% 78% 77% Hardware 11% 13% 14% Services 9% 9% 9% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) The Asia Pacific region includes Japan Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in our cloud and on-premise software revenues and services revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our hardware revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and on-premise software revenues during fiscal 2017 was attributable to growth in our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, growth in our software license updates and product support revenues, and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions and was partially offset by a decrease in our new software licenses revenues. The constant 55 Table of Contents currency increase in our services revenues during fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions. The constant currency decrease in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a reduction in our hardware products revenues and, to a lesser extent, a decline in our hardware support revenues. In constant currency, the Americas region contributed 54%, the EMEA region contributed 24% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 22% to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2017. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2017 relative to the prior year period due to higher sales and marketing and research and development expenses, which were primarily attributable to increased headcount and increased stock-based compensation expenses; and higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues. These constant currency expense increases in fiscal 2017 were partially offset by lower hardware expenses in fiscal 2017 due to a decline in hardware products revenues and lower hardware support costs due primarily to lower headcount; lower software support costs in fiscal 2017 due primarily to lower headcount; and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2017 due to certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. In constant currency, our total operating margin increased in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in our total revenues while total operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points, total operating expenses by 4 percentage points and total operating margin by 7 percentage points. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software business revenues and services business revenues due to similar reasons noted for the fiscal 2017 increases above. These constant currency increases in our revenues during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by constant currency decreases in our hardware business revenues. In constant currency, the EMEA region and the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately equal amounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas region was flat. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, higher restructuring expenses that were recorded pursuant to the Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan; see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), and higher general and administrative expenses due primarily to higher professional services fees, primarily legal related fees. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses, which decreased relative to fiscal 2015 as a result of a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million that was recorded in fiscal 2015. Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. 56 Table of Contents Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as certain other expense and income items that (increased) reduced our GAAP net income: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Cloud and on-premise software deferred revenues(1) $ 171 $ 9 $ 23 Hardware deferred revenues(1) — 1 4 Acquired deferred sales commissions amortization(2) (46 ) — — Amortization of intangible assets(3) 1,451 1,638 2,149 Acquisition related and other(4)(6) 103 42 211 Restructuring(5) 463 458 207 Stock-based compensation, operating segments (6) 415 305 258 Stock-based compensation, R&D and G&A(6) 900 729 670 Income tax effects(7) (1,233 ) (846 ) (971 ) $ 2,224 $ 2,336 $ 2,551 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS subscriptions, software support and hardware support obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. (2) Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms. Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these deferred sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented. (3) Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2017, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2018 $ 1,588 Fiscal 2019 1,419 Fiscal 2020 1,219 Fiscal 2021 1,050 Fiscal 2022 947 Thereafter 1,456 Total intangible assets, net $ 7,679 (4) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation expenses for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Included in acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 was a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million related to our hardware business. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal 2017 or 2016. (5) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2017 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2017 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2016 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our 2015 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2015 primarily related to costs incurred pursuant to our 2015 Restructuring Plan and our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2013 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 57 Table of Contents (6) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2017 2016 2015 Cloud SaaS $ 23 17 $ 10 Cloud PaaS and IaaS 5 4 5 Software license updates and product support 26 23 21 Hardware 11 12 12 Services 44 29 30 Sales and marketing 306 220 180 Stock-based compensation, operating segments 415 305 258 Research and development 770 609 522 General and administrative 130 120 148 Acquisition related and other 35 3 5 Total stock-based compensation $ 1,350 $ 1,037 $ 933 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. (7) The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented. Income tax effects for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 22.8%, 23.2% and 23.6%, respectively, instead of 18.9%, 22.2% and 22.6%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations. The difference between our fiscal 2017 tax rate derived from the table above and the tax rate derived from our consolidated statement of operations was primarily due to the net tax effects for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. The difference between our fiscal 2016 and 2015 tax rates derived from the table above and the tax rates derived from our consolidated statements of operations were primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. Cloud and On-Premise Software Business Our cloud and on-premise software business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings and the licensing of our software for on-premise and other IT environments with the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts. Our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally subscription based and generally recognized as revenues over the subscription period. New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within on-premise and other IT environments and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the software license is granted provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Software license updates and product support revenues are typically generated through the sale of software support contracts related to on-premise new software licenses purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and on-premise software business are included in cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses, software license updates and product support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and software support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and software offerings, and marketing program costs. 58 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2017 Actual Constant 2016 Actual Constant 2015 Cloud and On-Premise Software Revenues: Americas $ 17,395 6% 6% $ 16,344 -2% 1% $ 16,618 EMEA 8,422 -1% 4% 8,475 -3% 4% 8,767 Asia Pacific 4,572 9% 7% 4,178 2% 9% 4,106 Total revenues 30,389 5% 6% 28,997 -2% 3% 29,491 Expenses: Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS 1,901 30% 31% 1,468 37% 40% 1,072 Software license updates and product support 984 -9% -8% 1,077 -5% 1% 1,130 Sales and marketing 6,886 5% 6% 6,570 3% 8% 6,398 Total expenses 9,771 7% 8% 9,115 6% 11% 8,600 Total Margin $ 20,618 4% 5% $ 19,882 -5% 0% $ 20,891 Total Margin % 68% 69% 71% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 57% 56% 56% EMEA 28% 29% 30% Asia Pacific 15% 15% 14% Revenues by Offerings: Cloud software as a service $ 3,375 68% 70% $ 2,006 35% 38% $ 1,482 Cloud platform as a service and infrastructure as a service 1,366 60% 63% 852 38% 44% 616 New software licenses 6,418 -12% -11% 7,276 -15% -11% 8,535 Software license updates and product support 19,230 2% 3% 18,863 0% 5% 18,858 Total cloud and on-premise software revenues $ 30,389 5% 6% $ 28,997 -2% 3% $ 29,491 % Revenues by Offerings: Cloud software as a service 11% 7% 5% Cloud platform as a service and infrastructure as a service 4% 3% 2% New software licenses 21% 25% 29% Software license updates and product support 64% 65% 64% Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total revenues from our cloud and on-premise software business increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite. These fiscal 2017 increases were partially offset by decreases in our new software licenses revenues. The increases in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues and decreases in our new software licenses revenues during fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the continued strategic emphasis placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud offerings and we expect these revenue trends will continue. The increase in our fiscal 2017 software license updates and product support revenues was a result of substantially all customers electing to purchase software support contracts in conjunction with their new software licenses purchased, and due to the renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the fiscal 2017 and 2016 periods. During fiscal 2017, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed constant currency regional growth of 63%, 20% and 17%, respectively. In constant currency, total cloud and on-premise software expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses resulting from increased headcount, and higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and technology infrastructure expenses that were incurred to support the related cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues increases. These fiscal 2017 expense increases were partially offset by lower software license updates and product support expenses in fiscal 2017 due primarily to lower employee related expenses resulting from lower headcount. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and on-premise software business’ total margin increased due to the increase in revenues and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 as our total expenses grew at a faster rate than our total revenues for this business. 59 Table of Contents Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, total revenues from our cloud and on-premise software business increased by 3 percentage points during fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 due to similar reasons as noted above for the increase in fiscal 2017 revenues relative to fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed constant currency regional growth of 19%, 38% and 43%, respectively. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 4 percentage points, total cloud software and on-premise software expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses resulting from increased headcount, and higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting from increased headcount and technology infrastructure expenses that were incurred to support the related cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues increases. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and on-premise software business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 due primarily to the growth in our total expenses for this business. Hardware Business Our hardware business revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage, and industry-specific hardware products for on-premise IT environments that are generally recognized upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.

The decreases in hardware products revenues in both fiscal 2017 and 2016, each relative to the corresponding prior year periods, were primarily attributable to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our product lines, including lower margin products, partially offset by revenues growth in certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems products. The decreases in hardware support revenues in fiscal 2017 and 2016, each in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods, were primarily due to reductions in the hardware support customer contract base that resulted from a reduction in the volume and amount of hardware support agreements associated with lower hardware product revenues. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016 relative to the corresponding prior year periods primarily due to lower hardware products costs associated with lower hardware products revenues, lower employee expenses resulting from lower headcount, and lower external contractor expenses. In constant currency, total margin decreased in fiscal 2017 and 2016, each in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods, due to the decreases in hardware revenues during these periods. Total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware business increased in fiscal 2017 in comparison to fiscal 2016 due to lower expenses resulting primarily from lower headcount. Total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware business decreased in fiscal 2016 in comparison to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the decrease in fiscal 2016 hardware revenues. Services Business We offer services to customers and partners to help to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies. Services revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

Constant currency increases in our consulting revenues during fiscal 2017, which were primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions, were substantially offset by constant currency decreases in our education revenues. On a constant currency basis, modest services revenues growth in the EMEA region during fiscal 2017 was offset by services revenues declines in the Asia Pacific region, while the Americas region was flat. In constant currency, total services expenses increased during fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our consulting offerings, primarily higher consulting expense contributions from our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the increase in total expenses associated with this business. 61 Table of Contents Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 6 percentage points, our total services revenues increased slightly during fiscal 2016 due primarily to increases in our advanced customer support services revenues of which the majority of the growth was attributable to our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, the Americas contributed 44%, EMEA contributed 44% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the fiscal 2016 growth in our total services revenues. Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations of 5 percentage points, our total services expenses were flat in fiscal 2016 as reduced consulting and education expenses were partially offset by modest growth in our advanced customer support services expenses primarily due to our acquisitions. In constant currency, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to the increase in total revenues.

Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: On a constant currency basis, total general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal 2016 due to higher employee related expenses resulting from increased headcount and due to higher professional services expenses, primarily legal related expenses. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, and certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement 62 Table of Contents period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.

In addition, we recognized an acquisition related benefit of $19 million in fiscal 2016, which decreased acquisition related and other expenses during this period. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Acquisition related and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a $186 million goodwill impairment loss recorded during fiscal 2015. We also recorded an acquisition related benefit of $19 million and a litigation related benefit of $53 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, which reduced our expenses in those periods. Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2015 primarily related to our 2015 Restructuring Plan and our 2013 Restructuring Plan, which is also complete. Our management approved, committed to and initiated these plans in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Plan are up to $889 million and are recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. The total estimated remaining restructuring costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Plan were approximately $403 million as of May 31, 2017 and the majority of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal 2018. Our estimated costs are subject to change in future periods. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans.

This increase in interest expense during fiscal 2017 was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repayment of $2.0 billion of senior notes in January 2016. See Recent Financing Activities below and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our borrowings. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in May 2015. We also issued $10.0 billion of senior notes in July 2014, which also contributed to additional interest expense during fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015. These increases in interest expense during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by reductions in interest expense that primarily resulted from the maturity and repayment of $2.0 billion of senior notes in January 2016 and $1.5 billion of senior notes and the related fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in July 2014. Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income (losses), including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

In addition, we incurred higher other income, net during fiscal 2017 related to investment gains for our deferred compensation plan investments that we held and classified as trading in comparison to net losses for such investments during fiscal 2016. The aforementioned favorable movements in non-operating income, net during fiscal 2017 were partially offset by higher foreign currency losses, net during fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net in fiscal 2016 increased primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances and due to lower net foreign currency losses. Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. In addition, beginning in fiscal 2017, the provision for income taxes also differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to tax effects of stock-based compensation (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion). Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, among others. 64 Table of Contents Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2017 Actual Constant 2016 Actual Constant 2015 Provision for income taxes $ 2,182 -14% -15% $ 2,541 -12% -5% $ 2,896 Effective tax rate 18.9% 22.2% 22.6% Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 decreased relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2017 that related to stock-based compensation, which were recorded as a benefit to provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017, in comparison to fiscal 2016 when such benefits were recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion). To a lesser extent, the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 also benefited from a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, as well as net favorable changes relating to unrecognized tax benefits from audit settlements, statute of limitation releases, and other events. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 decreased, relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015, due in substantial part to lower net income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2016, settlements with certain tax authorities, and the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit, which collectively were partially offset by unfavorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings during fiscal 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Working capital $ 50,337 7% $ 47,105 0% $ 47,314 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 66,078 18% $ 56,125 3% $ 54,368 Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2017 in comparison to May 31, 2016 was primarily due to our issuance of $14.0 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2016, the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2017 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, including $9.0 billion of net cash used for our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. Working capital as of May 31, 2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was substantially flat as favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2016 and cash proceeds from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises were substantially offset by $10.4 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock in fiscal 2016, $2.5 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders in fiscal 2016, and $1.2 billion of cash used for capital expenditures in fiscal 2016. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2017 in comparison to May 31, 2016 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2017, $13.6 billion of cash inflows, net of repayments, from fiscal 2017 debt issuances, and cash inflows from stock option exercises. These fiscal 2017 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2017 cash outflows, primarily acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite, repurchases of our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $54.4 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31, 2017. We consider $47.5 billion 65 Table of Contents of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States. These undistributed earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately $15.1 billion as of May 31, 2017 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2017, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2017 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2016 balance sheet date. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2016 in comparison to May 31, 2015 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2016, $1.8 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflows from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises. These fiscal 2016 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2016 cash outflows, primarily $10.4 billion for repurchases of our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for capital expenditures. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31, 2016 decreased on a net basis in comparison to May 31, 2015 as the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2016. Days sales outstanding, which we calculate by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 44 days at May 31, 2017 compared with 46 days at May 31, 2016. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of any revenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS obligations, software license updates and product support obligations and hardware obligations to fair value.

Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses, cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, hardware products, hardware support arrangements and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2017 primarily due to the cash favorable effects of higher net income in fiscal 2017 in relation to fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of lower net income and the related unfavorable currency rate fluctuations on our net income relative to the corresponding prior year period. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. 66 Table of Contents Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired in fiscal 2017, an increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities and other investments (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) in fiscal 2017 and increased capital expenditures primarily related to our fiscal 2017 real estate purchases and investments in equipment to support our infrastructure to deliver our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) in fiscal 2016 and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in fiscal 2016. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $9.1 billion in comparison to net cash used for financing activities of $10.0 billion during fiscal 2016. The change in financing activities cash flows during fiscal 2017 in comparison to fiscal 2016 was primarily related to borrowing activities, net of debt repayments and stock repurchase activity. We received $13.6 billion of net cash inflows from borrowing activities during fiscal 2017 in comparison to $1.8 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 borrowing activities. In addition, we significantly reduced our stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2017, using $3.6 billion, in comparison to fiscal 2016 when we used $10.4 billion. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: We used net cash for financing activities of $10.0 billion during fiscal 2016 in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of $9.6 billion during fiscal 2015. The change in financing activities cash flows during fiscal 2016 in comparison to fiscal 2015 was primarily related to borrowing activities, net of debt repayments, and stock repurchase activities. Our borrowing activities, net of repurchases, provided $1.8 billion of net cash inflows in fiscal 2016 in comparison to $18.3 billion of net cash inflows in fiscal 2015. We used $10.4 billion for fiscal 2016 common stock repurchases in comparison to $8.1 billion used for fiscal 2015 common stock repurchase. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,126 3% $ 13,685 -6% $ 14,580 Capital expenditures (2,021 ) 70% (1,189 ) -15% (1,391 ) Free cash flow $ 12,105 -3% $ 12,496 -5% $ 13,189 Net income $ 9,335 $ 8,901 $ 9,938 Free cash flow as percent of net income 130% 140% 133% Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $912 million in fiscal 2017, $1.2 billion in 2016 and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2015, respectively, approximately 14%, 16% and 19% of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 67 Table of Contents Recent Financing Activities: Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2017, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.64 per share that totaled $2.6 billion. In June 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on August 2, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 19, 2017. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Revolving Credit Agreements: In May 2017, we entered into four revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2017 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2017 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2017 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula or (2) a base rate formula, each as set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 29, 2017, which is the termination date of the 2017 Credit Agreements. Additional details regarding the 2017 Credit Agreements are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In May 2016, we borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2016 Credit Agreements). In June 2016, we repaid the $3.8 billion and the 2016 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms. Senior Notes: In July 2016, we issued $14.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following: • $4.25 billion of 1.90% senior notes due September 2021; • $2.5 billion of 2.40% senior notes due September 2023; • $3.0 billion of 2.65% senior notes due July 2026; • $1.25 billion of 3.85% senior notes due July 2036; and • $3.0 billion of 4.00% senior notes due July 2046. We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additional details regarding the senior notes are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Other Fiscal 2017 Borrowings Activities: In connection with our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we assumed $310 million par value of legacy NetSuite convertible notes (NetSuite Debt), which had a fair value of $342 million as of the acquisition date. In December 2016, we repurchased and settled for cash substantially all of the NetSuite Debt (refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion). In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we assumed $113 million of debt due August 1, 2025 in connection with the acquisition of certain land and buildings. Common Stock Repurchases: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May 31, 2017, approximately $5.3 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 85.6 million shares for $3.5 billion, 271.9 million shares for $10.4 billion, and 193.7 million shares for $8.1 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations (described further below) or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, 68 Table of Contents cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2017: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 58,145 $ 9,800 $ 2,000 $ 4,500 $ 2,395 $ 8,250 $ 31,200 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 24,456 1,673 1,512 1,442 1,361 1,270 17,198 Operating leases(2) 1,721 389 330 260 203 146 393 Purchase obligations and other(3) 1,476 955 243 149 85 44 — Total contractual obligations $ 85,798 $ 12,817 $ 4,085 $ 6,351 $ 4,044 $ 9,710 $ 48,791 (1) Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2017 after considering: • certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31, 2017 and are subject to change in future periods; • interest payments on our floating-rate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior notes as of May 31, 2017 and are subject to change in future periods; and • certain cross-currency swap agreements for a series of our Euro denominated senior notes that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements. Principal and interest payments for our other Euro-denominated senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2017 and are subject to change in future periods. Refer to Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable and other borrowings and related derivative agreements. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $53 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2017. (3) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. As of May 31, 2017, we had $5.8 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2018. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control. Notes 15 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In 69 Table of Contents addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the technology industry. These factors have historically caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloud and on-premise software business and hardware business) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2018. The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2017 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 8,595 $ 9,035 $ 9,205 $ 10,892 Gross profit $ 6,819 $ 7,237 $ 7,314 $ 8,889 Operating income $ 2,641 $ 3,037 $ 2,959 $ 4,073 Net income $ 1,832 $ 2,032 $ 2,239 $ 3,231 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.44 $ 0.50 $ 0.55 $ 0.78 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.43 $ 0.48 $ 0.53 $ 0.76 Fiscal 2016 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 29 May 31 Revenues $ 8,448 $ 8,993 $ 9,012 $ 10,594 Gross profit $ 6,561 $ 7,105 $ 7,139 $ 8,640 Operating income $ 2,654 $ 2,955 $ 3,027 $ 3,968 Net income $ 1,747 $ 2,197 $ 2,142 $ 2,814 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.40 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 $ 0.68 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.40 $ 0.51 $ 0.50 $ 0.66 Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2014 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.2% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards or stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based 70 Table of Contents awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2017, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, less than 1% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we have recently reduced the level of our stock repurchases and we may further reduce repurchases in the future in order to use our available cash for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2017, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.5%. During fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of stock-based awards in excess of 100,000 stock option equivalent shares. A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer committee, approved individual stock-based award grants of up to 100,000 stock option equivalent shares to non-executive officers and employees. Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2017 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2014 463 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted 181 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed 20 Restricted stock-based awards vested and issued and stock options exercised (225 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (44 ) Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2017 395 Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 52 Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases (184 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2017 4,137 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2017 4,247 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2017 9.5% Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2017) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2017 9.5% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2017 1.2% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2017 -3.1% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to certain employees. These annual stock-based award grants are generally made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 71 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2017, substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with approximately 32% having maturity dates within one year and 68% having maturity dates within one to five years (a description of our marketable securities held is included in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). We hold a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31, 2017, we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $348 million. Our floating-rate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our investments portfolio associated with the risk of rising interest rates. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2017, total interest income was $802 million with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.47% on a worldwide basis. The table below presents the approximate fair values of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weighted-average interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31, 2017 and 2016. May 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value Weighted-AverageInterestRate Fair Value Weighted-AverageInterestRate Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,784 0.63% $ 20,152 0.35% Marketable securities 44,294 1.88% 35,973 1.62% Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 66,078 1.47% $ 56,125 1.16% Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk—Fixed to Variable Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were $57.9 billion as of May 31, 2017, consisting of $51.9 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $2.3 billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $3.8 billion of other borrowings, primarily under revolving credit agreements. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes), our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), and our $1.5 billion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes, and July 2021 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed-rate borrowings for trading purposes. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The total fair value gain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2017 was $40 million. If LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2017, the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $153 million. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 72 Table of Contents By issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. As of May 31, 2017, the weighted-average interest rate associated with our Floating-Rate Notes and January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements, was 1.68%. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2017, if LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately $73 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2017 and 2016. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $152 million, $110 million and $157 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of 73 Table of Contents the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2017, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2017 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May 31, 2016. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were decreases of $86 million, $115 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The following table includes estimates of the U.S. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies that we held as of May 31, 2017: (in millions) U.S DollarEquivalent atMay 31, 2017 Euro $ 1,331 Canadian Dollar 450 Japanese Yen 409 British Pound 277 Indian Rupee 266 Russian Ruble 253 Australian Dollar 237 Chinese Renminbi 174 Other foreign currencies 1,780 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 5,177 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $518 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Net Investment Hedge In July 2013, we issued €750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes). We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar. As a result, provided there is no ineffectiveness related to the hedge, the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated July 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled $1 million of net other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2017. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the July 2025 Notes representing any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in non-operating income, net. We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2017. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the July 2025 Notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker by 10% in comparison to the Euro as of May 31, 2017, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the July 2025 Notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased by approximately $83 million.",2023-12-30 16:56:36.257332
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environments—applications, platform and infrastructure. Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based, on-premise, or hybrid, which enable customer choice and flexibility. We market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force that is employed by our domestic and international subsidiaries and is positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs. We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align as to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license line of business, which represented 82%, 80% and 78% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Cloud services and license support revenues include: • license support revenues, which is our largest revenues stream. Oracle license support grants rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Substantially all of our customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase Oracle applications, platform and/or infrastructure licenses and substantially all customers renew their license support contracts annually in order to continue to benefit from Oracle’s research and development investments that are utilized as a part of unspecified periodic license updates that may be released and that customers with current license support contracts are entitled to. Our license support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license, are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the support services are delivered over the contractual terms; and • cloud services revenues, which includes revenues from Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings (collectively, Oracle Cloud Services), which deliver applications, platform and infrastructure technologies, respectively, via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, host, manage and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for customer cloud-based, hybrid IT or other IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term. The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services arrangements have durations of 12 to 36 months and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. We strive to renew these cloud services contracts when they are eligible for renewal. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cloud license and on-premise license revenues include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the license is granted to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase license support contracts, as described above. Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand has increased for our Oracle Cloud Services. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications, platform and infrastructure licenses and license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue. Our cloud services revenues growth and our cloud license and on-premise license revenues growth are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our cloud services contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Our license support revenues growth is primarily influenced by three factors: (1) the continuity of substantially all of our license support customer contract base renewing their license support contracts and substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their purchase of a new license; (2) the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new licenses; and (3) the pricing of new licenses sold. Customers do so in order to benefit from Oracle’s research and development investments that are utilized as a part of unspecified periodic license updates that may be released and that customers with current license support contracts are entitled to. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to: • expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings, including the high percentage of customers that purchase and renew their license support contracts; • continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings; and • contributions from our acquisitions. We believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services. Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. Hardware Business Our hardware business, which represented 10%, 11% and 13% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware related software, and related hardware support. Hardware transactions are generally recognized as revenues upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also offers related hardware support. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by, among others: our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings such as PaaS and IaaS; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; certain of our acquisitions; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Services Business Our services business helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced support services and education services and represented 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 and 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by, among others: our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings; our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues; certain of our acquisitions; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; and tighter controls over discretionary spending. Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including NetSuite in fiscal 2017. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: • Revenue Recognition; • Business Combinations; • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; • Accounting for Income Taxes; and • Legal and Other Contingencies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include: • cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud license and on-premise licenses, which represent licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise deployments; • hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and • services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting, advanced customer support and education services. Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Elements) Our revenue recognition policy for non-software deliverables including our cloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements, and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud services revenues, hardware products revenues, hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Revenues from the sales of our non-software elements are recognized when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) we deliver the products or services; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. Revenues for our cloud services offerings sold on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers. Revenues for cloud services offerings sold on a usage basis are generally recognized as the customer consumes the service, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues from the sale of hardware products are generally recognized upon delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customer’s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Cloud Services Offerings, Hardware Products, Hardware Support and Related Services (Non-software Arrangements) We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase non-software related products and services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as non-software multiple-element arrangements). Each element within a non-software multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met: the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement, or in the case of our cloud services offerings, we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud services subscription. For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements. For our non-software multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available (a description as to how we determine VSOE, TPE and ESP is provided below). If a tangible hardware product includes software, we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the product’s essential functionality and, if so, the entire product is treated as a non-software deliverable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions. When possible, we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and non-software multiple-element arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist, we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions, including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors. Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and On-Premise License and License Related Services (Software Elements) The basis for our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and related services revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud license and on-premise license revenues and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying license, we recognize cloud license and on-premise license revenues when: (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the products; (3) the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable. Revenues that are not recognized at the time of license sale because the foregoing conditions are not met, are generally recognized when those conditions are subsequently met. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option. We recognize the related fees ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically one year. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term. Substantially all of our customers renew their license support contracts annually. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Cloud License and On-Premise License, Support and Related Services (Software Arrangements) We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, license support and related services from us at the same time, or within close proximity of one another (referred to as software related multiple-element arrangements). For those software related multiple-element arrangements, we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of cloud license and on-premise license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985-605. Under the residual method, if VSOE exists for undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the license. Where VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element in such arrangement, no revenue is recognized until the earlier of the point in time at which 1) VSOE has been established for such element; or 2) the element that does not have VSOE has been delivered. Revenue Recognition for Multiple-Element Arrangements—Arrangements with Software and Non-software Elements We also enter into multiple-element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non-software related products and services offerings including cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, license support, cloud services offerings, hardware products, hardware support, consulting, advanced customer support services and education. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and the non-software group of elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. In addition, we allocate the consideration within the non-software group to each respective element within that group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement’s inception as described above. After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and non-software group of elements, we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below. Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Non-software Elements Many of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business. Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from cloud license and on-premise license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985-605. The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product), degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions, then cloud license and on-premise license revenues and/or hardware products revenues, including the costs of hardware products, are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method. We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation. We consider multiple factors, including the history with the customer in similar transactions, the “essential use” of the license or hardware products and the planning, budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues for such arrangements once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity for such arrangements. We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. However, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. We evaluate non-standard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements (based upon similarity of customers, products, and arrangement economics) and, if so, generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short-term payment terms, we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division. Since fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have established a history of collection, without concessions, on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis to third-party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Our customers include several of our suppliers and, occasionally, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies (Concurrent Transactions). Cloud license and on-premise license agreements, sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a common period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction, at terms we consider to be at arm’s length and settle the purchase in cash. We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We estimate the fair values of our cloud services and license support, and hardware obligations assumed as part of an acquisition. The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling these assumed obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the assumed obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired. The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date. We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a result of our fair value estimates for these obligations, we did not recognize certain cloud services and license support revenue amounts and hardware revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations (refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for further discussion). To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management. Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs, costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management, but may be refined in subsequent periods. We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. According to ASC 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the quantitative impairment test. Should the qualitative assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, goodwill impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed on March 1, 2018, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we recognize an impairment charge in fiscal 2017 or 2016. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe that the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. On December 22, 2017 the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), was signed into law. The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been accounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors, assumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and existing tax laws and a range of historical and forecasted financial and tax-specific facts and information, including, without limitation, the amount of cash and other specified assets anticipated to be held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances during interim periods pending finalization of those balances. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time. We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized to our consolidated statements of operations in the period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in this period. Such detriment/benefit can materially impact our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and prospective periods. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. In addition, as a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Results of Operations Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2018 relative to May 31, 2017, was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; creates a quasi-territorial tax system that a) generally allows, among other provisions, companies to repatriate certain foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. income tax for such earnings generated after December 31, 2017 and b) generally requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to December 31, 2017 that, in substantial part, were previously tax deferred; creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings; limits deductibility of certain future compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees; and provides tax incentives for the exportation of U.S. products to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment, among other provisions. Because we have a May 31 fiscal year end, our fiscal 2018 blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was approximately 29%. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During fiscal 2018, our provision for income taxes increased and our net income decreased, primarily as a result of the following items related to the enactment of the Tax Act: • $7.8 billion of income tax expense, which we refined by a $166 million increase as of May 31, 2018 from our initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), related to the application of the one-time transition tax to certain foreign subsidiary earnings that were generated prior to December 31, 2017 and for which such expense was substantially recorded to non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and corresponds to the amount we currently expect to periodically settle over an eight year period as provided by the Tax Act; partially offset by: • $820 million of income tax benefit, which we refined by a $76 million increase as of May 31, 2018 from our initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with SAB 118, related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future; and • the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018, which we generally expect will continue into future periods. The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been accounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to SAB 118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors, assumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and existing tax laws and a range of historical financial and tax-specific facts and information, including among other items, the amount of cash and other specified assets and liabilities of the company and its foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances pending finalization of those balances. We expect the enactment of the Tax Act to generally provide greater flexibility for us to access and utilize our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 1, 2018, as well as for prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries’ future earnings and profits. We believe we have sufficient cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances, as well as access to other capital resources, if required, to settle the $7.8 billion one-time transition tax described above. Impacts of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was impacted by our recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to the growth in certain of our businesses’ revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • the amounts shown as cloud services and license support deferred revenues and hardware deferred revenues in our “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statement of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses. In addition, we discuss below the results of each our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each business in the discussion below. Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation includes revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts and hardware contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. In addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impractical to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2017, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.16 million in fiscal 2018 (using 1.16 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.11 million in fiscal 2017 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements however, would translate the fiscal 2018 results using the fiscal 2017 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2018 Actual Constant 2017 Actual Constant 2016 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 22,088 5% 5% $ 21,038 3% 3% $ 20,466 EMEA(1) 11,410 7% 1% 10,630 -2% 2% 10,881 Asia Pacific(2) 6,333 4% 3% 6,060 6% 4% 5,700 Total revenues 39,831 6% 3% 37,728 2% 3% 37,047 Total Operating Expenses 26,152 5% 3% 25,018 2% 3% 24,443 Total Operating Margin $ 13,679 8% 5% $ 12,710 1% 2% $ 12,604 Total Operating Margin % 34% 34% 34% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 55% 56% 55% EMEA 29% 28% 29% Asia Pacific 16% 16% 16% Total Revenues by Business: Cloud and license $ 32,444 7% 5% $ 30,218 4% 5% $ 28,990 Hardware 3,993 -4% -6% 4,152 -11% -10% 4,668 Services 3,394 1% -1% 3,358 -1% 1% 3,389 Total revenues $ 39,831 6% 3% $ 37,728 2% 3% $ 37,047 % Revenues by Business: Cloud and license 82% 80% 78% Hardware 10% 11% 13% Services 8% 9% 9% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (2) The Asia Pacific region includes Japan Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017: Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to growth in our cloud and license revenues, partially offset by decreases in our hardware revenues and services revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license revenues during fiscal 2018 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technology and support services. To a lesser extent, our cloud and license revenues also increased due to revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. The constant currency decrease in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2018 was due to the reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud and license technologies. The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our education and advanced customer support services revenues. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 78%, 10% and 12%, respectively, to the growth in our fiscal 2018 total revenues. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cloud services and license support expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increases in our revenues; higher sales and marketing expenses related to our cloud and license business; increased stock-based compensation expenses; higher general and administrative expenses; increased restructuring expenses; and higher intangible asset amortization. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2018, which primarily consisted of lower research and development expenses primarily related to lower 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements employee expenses; and lower hardware products costs and a related decrease in hardware sales and marketing costs, both of which aligned to lower hardware revenues. In constant currency, our total operating margin increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in our cloud and license revenues and our services revenues, partially offset by a decrease in our hardware revenues. The constant currency increases in our cloud and license revenues during fiscal 2017 and constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2017 were primarily attributable to similar reasons as noted above for the fiscal 2018 changes of each. The constant currency services revenues increase during fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to certain acquisitions. In constant currency, the Americas region contributed 54%, the EMEA region contributed 24% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 22% to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2017. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2017 relative to the prior year period due to higher sales and marketing and research and development expenses, which were primarily attributable to increased headcount and increased stock-based compensation expenses; and higher cloud services and license support expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our revenues. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2017, primarily lower hardware expenses due to similar reasons noted for the fiscal 2018 decrease above and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2017 due to certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. In constant currency, our total operating margin increased in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in our total revenues while total operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impact of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Cloud services and license support deferred revenues(1) $ 47 $ 171 $ 9 Hardware deferred revenues(1) — — 1 Acquired deferred sales commissions amortization(2) (22 ) (46 ) — Amortization of intangible assets(3) 1,620 1,451 1,638 Acquisition related and other(4)(6) 52 103 42 Restructuring(5) 588 463 458 Stock-based compensation, operating segments(6) 505 415 305 Stock-based compensation, R&D and G&A(6) 1,101 900 729 Income tax effects(7) (1,433 ) (1,233 ) (846 ) Income tax reform(8) 6,961 — — $ 9,419 $ 2,224 $ 2,336 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts and hardware contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts and hardware revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (2) Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms. Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these acquired capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these acquired deferred sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented. (3) Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2018, estimated future amortization related to intangible assets was as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2019 $ 1,605 Fiscal 2020 1,400 Fiscal 2021 1,174 Fiscal 2022 966 Fiscal 2023 613 Thereafter 912 Total intangible assets, net $ 6,670 (4) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation expenses for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. (5) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2018 and 2017 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2017 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2016 primarily related to costs incurred pursuant to our Fiscal 2015 Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan) and our Fiscal 2013 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2013 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in the discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (6) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2018 2017 2016 Cloud services and license support $ 82 $ 54 $ 44 Hardware 10 11 12 Services 52 44 29 Sales and marketing 361 306 220 Stock-based compensation, operating segments 505 415 305 Research and development 921 770 609 General and administrative 180 130 120 Acquisition related and other 1 35 3 Total stock-based compensation $ 1,607 $ 1,350 $ 1,037 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated generally upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. (7) For fiscal 2018, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after adjusting for the effects of the items within the table above, excluding income tax reform (see footnote (8) below), resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.1%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statements of operations, primarily due to the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. The income tax effects presented for fiscal 2017 and 2016 were calculated reflecting effective tax rates of 22.8% and 23.2%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets, and the net tax effects of stock-based compensation. (8) The income tax reform adjustments for fiscal 2018 presented in the table above were due to the our enactment of the Tax Act (refer to “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” above for additional discussion), which increased our GAAP provision for income taxes during fiscal 2018. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through various deployment models including license support offerings; Oracle 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cloud Services offerings; and cloud license and on-premise license offerings. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term. Our Oracle Cloud Services offerings deliver certain of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support, and revenues are generally recognized over the subscription period. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized as revenues when unrestricted access to the license is granted, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.

Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above for additional information. (2) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017: Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total revenues from our cloud and license business increased in fiscal 2018 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. The increases in our constant currency cloud 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements services and license support revenues during fiscal 2018 were primarily due to the purchase and renewal of our cloud-based services and license support services, and due to contributions from our recent acquisitions. These revenues increases were partially offset by decreases in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues during fiscal 2018. In constant currency, our total applications revenues and total platform and infrastructure revenues grew during fiscal 2018 as customers continued to deploy our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through a wide array of different deployment models that we offer that enable customer choice. In constant currency, the Americas region contributed 71%, the EMEA region contributed 15% and Asia Pacific region contributed 14% of the constant currency revenues growth for this business during fiscal 2018. In constant currency, total cloud and license expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cloud services and license support expenses and higher sales and marketing expenses, both of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses from higher headcount. In addition, our constant currency cloud services and license support expenses increased during fiscal 2018 due to higher technology infrastructure expenses that supported the growth in our revenues. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license segment’s total margin increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues for this segment while total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to expenses growth for this segment. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total revenues, total expenses and total margin from our cloud and license business each increased in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016 due to similar reasons as noted above for the increases in fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2017, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 63%, 20% and 17%, respectively, of the constant currency revenues growth for this business. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 as our total expenses grew at a faster rate than our total revenues for this business. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Hardware Business Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware products that are generally recognized as revenues upon delivery to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.

Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, due to lower hardware products revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower hardware support revenues. The decreases in hardware products revenues in both fiscal 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, were primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to lower hardware products costs and lower employee related expenses, which aligned to lower hardware revenues. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In constant currency, total margin and total margin as percentage of revenues for our hardware segment increased during fiscal 2018 and 2017, each relative to the corresponding prior year period, due to expense decreases in each of these periods. Services Business We offer services to customers and partners to help to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies. Services revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017: Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased during fiscal 2018 due primarily to revenue declines in our advanced customer services and education revenues. Constant currency decreases in our services revenues in the Americas region were partially offset by a constant currency services revenues increase in the Asia Pacific region, while services revenues in the EMEA region were flat. In constant currency, total services expenses were flat during fiscal 2018. Total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2018 due to the revenue decreases for this segment. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues were flat in fiscal 2017. Constant currency increases in our consulting revenues during fiscal 2017, which were primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions, were substantially offset by constant currency decreases in our education revenues. On a constant currency basis, modest services revenues growth in the EMEA region during fiscal 2017 was offset by services revenues declines in the Asia Pacific region, while the Americas region was flat. In constant currency, total services margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased and total services expenses increased during fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our consulting offerings, primarily higher consulting expense contributions from our recent acquisitions. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures.

These fiscal 2018 cost savings were partially offset by investments in the development of our cloud-based offerings and by higher stock-based compensation during fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: On a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2017, primarily due to increased employee related expenses and higher stock-based compensation.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses as a result of our acquisition of NetSuite and higher professional fees. In addition, we recognized an acquisition related benefit of $19 million in fiscal 2016, which decreased acquisition related and other expenses during this period. Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2017 due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized, partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our acquisitions made in fiscal 2017, including those associated with our acquisition of NetSuite. Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements cost structure prospectively.

Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2016 primarily related to our 2015 Restructuring Plan which is complete. Our management approved, committed to and initiated these plans in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans. The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2017 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued move toward developing, marketing and selling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Cost savings realized pursuant to our 2017 Restructuring Plan initiatives were primarily offset by investments in resources and geographies that address the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based offerings as customer preferences pivot to the Oracle Cloud.

See Recent Financing Activities below and Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our borrowings. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Interest expense increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $14.0 billion of senior notes in July 2016. This increase in interest expense during fiscal 2017 was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repayment of $2.0 billion of senior notes in January 2016. Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income (losses), including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net for fiscal 2017 increased primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances and higher interest rates. In addition, we incurred higher other income, net during fiscal 2017 related to investment gains for our deferred compensation plan investments that we held and classified as trading in comparison to net losses for such investments during fiscal 2016. The aforementioned favorable movements in non-operating income, net during fiscal 2017 were partially offset by higher foreign currency losses, net during fiscal 2017. Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. In fiscal 2018, the Tax Act was signed into law. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described above under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal 2018 presented varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act due primarily to the January 1, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, the impacts of the Tax Act upon adoption, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Prior to the January 1, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, our provision for income taxes historically differed from the tax computed at the previous U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.

These unfavorable impacts to our provision for income taxes were partially offset by higher fiscal 2018 realized excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 decreased relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2017 that related to stock-based compensation, which were recorded as a benefit to provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017, in comparison to fiscal 2016 when such benefits were recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital. To a lesser extent, the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 also benefited from a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, as well as net favorable changes in fiscal 2017 relating to unrecognized tax benefits from audit settlements, statute of limitation releases, and other events. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016 Working capital $ 56,769 13% $ 50,337 7% $ 47,105 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 67,261 2% $ 66,078 18% $ 56,125 Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2018 in comparison to May 31, 2017 was primarily due to our issuance of $10.0 billion of long-term senior notes in November 2017 (refer to Recent Financing Activities Below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2018 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, cash used for capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2018. The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2017 in comparison to May 31, 2016 was primarily due to our issuance of $14.0 billion of long-term senior notes in July 2016, the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2017 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, including $9.0 billion of net cash used for our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2018 in comparison to May 31, 2017 was primarily due to the issuance of $12.5 billion of cash inflows from fiscal 2018 debt issuances (refer to Recent Financing Activities Below for additional information), cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises. These cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2018 cash outflows, primarily $11.3 billion of repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $9.8 billion of borrowings, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act on January 1, 2018, we expect greater flexibility in accessing and utilizing our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, as well as prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries’ future earnings and profits. We believe we have sufficient cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and access to additional capital resources, if required, to settle the $7.8 billion one-time transition tax described under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” above. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased on a net basis as of May 31, 2018 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31, 2017 balance sheet date. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2017 in comparison to May 31, 2016 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2017, $13.6 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2017 debt issuances, net of debt repayments, and cash inflows from fiscal 2017 stock option 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements exercises. These fiscal 2017 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2017 cash outflows, primarily acquisitions, including our acquisition of NetSuite, repurchases of our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, and cash used for capital expenditures. Additionally, our reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31, 2017 decreased on a net basis in comparison to May 31, 2016 as the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2017.

Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes and leased facilities. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017: Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for the one-time income tax accounting effects of our adoption of the Tax Act (refer to “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” for additional discussion). Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2017 primarily due to the cash favorable effects of higher net income in fiscal 2017 in relation to fiscal 2016. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and a decrease in cash used to purchase marketable securities and other investments, net of proceeds received from sales and maturities. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired in fiscal 2017, an increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities and other investments (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) in fiscal 2017 and increased capital expenditures primarily related to our fiscal 2017 real estate purchases and investments in equipment to support our infrastructure to deliver our cloud services. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017: Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2018 was $10.0 billion in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of $9.1 billion during fiscal 2017. The increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increased stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2018 (we used $11.3 billion in fiscal 2018 for stock repurchases in comparison to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2017) and debt related cash flows for which we had $2.6 billion of cash inflows from borrowings, net of repayments, in fiscal 2018 in comparison to $13.6 billion of cash inflows from borrowings, net of repayments, in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $9.1 billion in comparison to net cash used for financing activities of $10.0 billion during fiscal 2016. The change in financing activities cash flows during fiscal 2017 in comparison to fiscal 2016 was primarily related to borrowing activities, 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements net of debt repayments and stock repurchase activity. We received $13.6 billion of net cash inflows from borrowing activities during fiscal 2017 in comparison to $1.8 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 borrowing activities. In addition, we significantly reduced our stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2017, using $3.6 billion, in comparison to fiscal 2016 when we used $10.4 billion. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2018 Change 2017 Change 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 15,386 9% $ 14,126 3% $ 13,685 Capital expenditures (1,736 ) -14% (2,021 ) 70% (1,189 ) Free cash flow $ 13,650 13% $ 12,105 -3% $ 12,496 Net income $ 3,825 $ 9,335 $ 8,901 Free cash flow as percent of net income 357% 130% 140% Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018, $912 million in 2017 and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016, respectively, or approximately 24%, 14% and 16% of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Recent Financing Activities: Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2018, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.76 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 31, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 17, 2018. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Swap Agreements: In May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk associated with our €750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes) by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated July 2025 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreement was to eliminate the uncertainty of the principal balance in U.S. Dollars associated with the July 2025 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the July 2025 Notes at $868 million and modify the related fixed interest obligations so that the interest payable on these notes became variable based on LIBOR. As of May 31, 2018, our July 2025 Notes had an effective interest rate of 5.17% after considering the effects of the aforementioned cross-currency interest rate swap arrangement. We are accounting for these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). In April 2018, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 6.50% senior notes due April 2038 (April 2038 Notes), so that the interest payable on these notes became variable based on LIBOR. As of May 31, 2018, our April 2038 Notes had effective interest rates of 5.65% after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements. We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Revolving Credit Agreements: In May 2018, we entered into three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2018 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $2.5 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2018 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2018 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula or (2) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2018 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 28, 2018, which is the termination date of the 2018 Credit Agreements. Additional details regarding the 2018 Credit Agreements are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0 billion. As of May 31, 2018, approximately $17.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion, 85.6 million shares for $3.5 billion, and 271.9 million shares for $10.4 billion in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Senior Notes: In November 2017, we issued $10.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following: • $1.25 billion of 2.625% senior notes due February 2023; • $2.00 billion of 2.95% senior notes due November 2024; • $2.75 billion of 3.25% senior notes due November 2027; • $1.75 billion of 3.80% senior notes due November 2037; and • $2.25 billion of 4.00% senior notes due November 2047. We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2018, we repaid $3.5 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regarding our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of May 31, 2018: Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 60,927 $ 4,500 $ 4,500 $ 2,446 $ 8,250 $ 3,750 $ 37,481 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 26,959 1,938 1,805 1,732 1,629 1,492 18,363 Operating leases(2) 1,639 377 314 248 184 144 372 Purchase obligations and other(3) 1,375 757 291 189 114 24 — Total contractual obligations $ 90,900 $ 7,572 $ 6,910 $ 4,615 $ 10,177 $ 5,410 $ 56,216 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (1) Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2018 after considering: • certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31, 2018 and are subject to change in future periods; • interest payments on our floating-rate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior notes as of May 31, 2018 and are subject to change in future periods; • certain cross-currency swap agreements for our €1.25 billion 2.25% senior notes due 2021 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements; and • certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for our €750 million 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements. Refer to Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable and other borrowings and related derivative agreements. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities. We have approximately $61 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2018. (3) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. As of May 31, 2018, we had $6.6 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2019. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements, including the $7.8 billion one-time transition tax described under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017” above. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of sales force incentive compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the technology industry. These factors have historically caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year. Similarly, the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloud and license business and hardware business) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2019. The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual data due to rounding. Fiscal 2018 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 9,187 $ 9,621 $ 9,771 $ 11,251 Gross profit $ 7,254 $ 7,656 $ 7,769 $ 9,071 Operating income $ 2,821 $ 3,069 $ 3,410 $ 4,380 Net income (loss) $ 2,210 $ 2,233 $ (4,024 ) $ 3,408 Earnings (loss) per share—basic $ 0.53 $ 0.54 $ (0.98 ) $ 0.84 Earnings (loss) per share—diluted $ 0.52 $ 0.52 $ (0.98 ) $ 0.82 Fiscal 2017 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 8,595 $ 9,035 $ 9,205 $ 10,892 Gross profit $ 6,819 $ 7,237 $ 7,314 $ 8,889 Operating income $ 2,641 $ 3,037 $ 2,959 $ 4,073 Net income $ 1,832 $ 2,032 $ 2,239 $ 3,231 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.44 $ 0.50 $ 0.55 $ 0.78 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.43 $ 0.48 $ 0.53 $ 0.76 Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2015 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards or stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2018, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, approximately 19% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At May 31, 2018, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.8%. During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees, all stock-based award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2018 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2018 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2015 441 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted 240 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed 17 Restricted stock-based awards vested and issued and stock options exercised (260 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (45 ) Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2018 393 Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 70 Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases (199 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2018 3,997 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2018 4,152 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2018 9.8% Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2018) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2018 8.4% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2018 1.7% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2018 -3.1% Our Compensation Committee approves the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to certain employees. These annual stock-based award grants are generally made during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $67.3 billion and $66.1 billion as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2018, substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality with approximately 26% having maturity dates within one year and 74% having maturity dates within one to five years (a description of our marketable securities held is included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). We held a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted as interest rates increase, 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may vary due to changes in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $308 million and $348 million, respectively. Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2018 and 2017, total interest income was $1.2 billion and $802 million, respectively, with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.73% and 1.47%, respectively, on a worldwide basis. Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk—Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were $60.9 billion as of May 31, 2018, consisting of $56.9 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $1.2 billion of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $2.8 billion of other borrowings, primarily under the 2018 Credit Agreements. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.375% senior notes due January 2019 (January 2019 Notes), our $2.0 billion of 2.25% senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes), our $1.5 billion of 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes), and our April 2038 Notes, so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. We have also entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes, October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes, April 2038 Notes and July 2025 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The fair values of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 were a $26 million net loss and a $40 million gain, respectively. We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements during fiscal 2018 and 2017 were primarily attributable to an increase in forward interest rate prices. If LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $315 million and $153 million, respectively. By issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017, if LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately $86 million and $73 million, respectively, as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.4 billion as of each of May 31, 2018 and 2017 and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.4 billion as of each of May 31, 2018 and 2017. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2018 and 2017. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $74 million, $152 million and $110 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2018 increased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May 31, 2017. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars was an increase of $57 million for fiscal 2018, and decreases of $86 million and $115 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as of May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017 the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $555 million and $518 million, respectively, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 16:56:22.331593
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise deployments, cloud-based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployment) such as our Oracle Cloud at Customer offering (an instance of Oracle Cloud in a customer’s own data center). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align as to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license line of business, which represented 83%, 81% and 80% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Cloud services and license support revenues include: • license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and • cloud services revenues, which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cloud license and on-premise license revenues include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point in time for revenue recognition of license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as described above. Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue. Our cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; our acquisitions; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to: • expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; • continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings; and • contributions from our acquisitions. We believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services. Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably; the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues ratably; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery, over those four quarterly periods. Hardware Business Our hardware business, which represented 9%, 10% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements management and other hardware related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by, among others: our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including IaaS; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; certain of our acquisitions; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Services Business Our services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 and 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property, and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced customer support services and education services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by, among others: our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings; certain of our acquisitions; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; and tighter controls over customer discretionary spending. Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including NetSuite in fiscal 2017. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB), ASC, and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes a description of our significant accounting policies. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions as we apply our significant accounting policies. The accounting policies that reflect estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and for which we include additional discussion below are: • Revenue Recognition; • Business Combinations; • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; • Accounting for Income Taxes; and • Legal and Other Contingencies. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The most critical judgments required in applying Topic 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation. Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered. We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In such situations, we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable. We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Accounting for Income Taxes Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Results of Operations Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2019 relative to May 31, 2018, was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), which was effective for us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018. Information regarding our adoption and the impacts of the Tax Act are included in Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Impacts of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was impacted by our recent acquisitions. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services revenues (for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date) to certain of our businesses’ revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. When material, we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition comparisons, as well as any quantified amounts themselves, may provide indications of general trends, any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons: • any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and • the amounts shown as cloud services and license support deferred revenues in our “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew. Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statement of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses. In addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 results of each our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each business in the discussion below. Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation includes revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. In addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impractical to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented below and the results for both fiscal 2019 and 2018 have been accounted for and presented to reflect our adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2017-07, neither of which materially impacted our financial condition or results of operations for fiscal 2019 or 2018. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on June 22, 2018, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor. Our consolidated 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements financial statements for the fiscal years ended and as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been retrospectively restated to reflect the adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2017-07. The adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2017-07 did not have a material impact on the comparability of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017 as presented in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. Additional information regarding our adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2017-07 is included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2018, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2019 and 2018, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.11 million in fiscal 2019 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.16 million in fiscal 2018 (using 1.16 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2019 results using the fiscal 2018 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 21,856 1% 2% $ 21,648 EMEA(1) 11,270 -1% 3% 11,409 Asia Pacific 6,380 1% 5% 6,326 Total revenues 39,506 0% 3% 39,383 Total Operating Expenses 25,971 -1% 2% 26,119 Total Operating Margin $ 13,535 2% 5% $ 13,264 Total Operating Margin % 34% 34% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 55% 55% EMEA 29% 29% Asia Pacific 16% 16% Total Revenues by Business: Cloud and license $ 32,562 2% 4% $ 31,994 Hardware 3,704 -7% -5% 3,994 Services 3,240 -5% -2% 3,395 Total revenues $ 39,506 0% 3% $ 39,383 % Revenues by Business: Cloud and license 83% 81% Hardware 9% 10% Services 8% 9% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 due to growth in our cloud and license revenues, partially offset by decreases in our hardware revenues and services revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud deployment models and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud and license support contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technology and support services, and was also attributable to growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. The constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were due to a reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our consulting and education services revenues. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 40%, 33% and 27%, respectively, to the growth in our fiscal 2019 total revenues. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher expenses related to our cloud and license business, which resulted primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues. This constant currency expense increase was partially offset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018, primarily lower expenses related to our hardware business and lower restructuring expenses. In constant currency, our total operating margin increased during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under “Impacts of Acquisitions” (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information. Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Cloud services and license support deferred revenues(1) $ 20 $ 47 Acquired deferred sales commissions amortization(2) — (22 ) Amortization of intangible assets(3) 1,689 1,620 Acquisition related and other(4)(6) 44 52 Restructuring(5) 443 588 Stock-based compensation, operating segments(6) 518 505 Stock-based compensation, R&D and G&A(6) 1,135 1,101 Income tax effects(7) (1,406 ) (1,431 ) Income tax reform(8) (389 ) 6,870 $ 2,054 $ 9,330 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. (2) Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms. Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these acquired capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these acquired deferred sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented. (3) Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2019, estimated future amortization related to intangible assets was as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2020 $ 1,583 Fiscal 2021 1,339 Fiscal 2022 1,090 Fiscal 2023 668 Fiscal 2024 440 Thereafter 159 Total intangible assets, net $ 5,279 (4) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation expenses for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. (5) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2019 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2019 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2018 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2017 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in the discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (6) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2019 2018 Cloud services and license support $ 99 $ 82 Hardware 10 10 Services 49 52 Sales and marketing 360 361 Stock-based compensation, operating segments 518 505 Research and development 963 921 General and administrative 172 180 Acquisition related and other — 1 Total stock-based compensation $ 1,653 $ 1,607 Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated generally upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. (7) For fiscal 2019 and 2018, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items; after excluding the effects of income tax reform (see footnote (8) below); and, for fiscal 2019, after excluding a tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure; resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.5% and 20.8% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, instead of 9.7% and 71.1%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations. (8) The income tax reform adjustments presented in the table above were due to the enactment of the Tax Act (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), which was effective for us in fiscal 2018, and also due to subsequent income tax expense adjustments made pursuant to SAB 118 during fiscal 2019. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through various deployment models, including Oracle Cloud Services offerings, cloud license and on-premise license offerings and license support offerings. Oracle Cloud Services deliver certain of our applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, host, manage, upgrade and support. Our cloud services revenues are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses purchased and renewed by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Cloud and License Revenues: Americas(1) $ 18,410 2% 3% $ 18,030 EMEA(1) 9,168 0% 4% 9,163 Asia Pacific(1) 5,004 3% 7% 4,848 Total revenues(1) 32,582 2% 4% 32,041 Expenses: Cloud services and license support(2) 3,597 5% 6% 3,441 Sales and marketing(2) 7,398 3% 5% 7,213 Total expenses(2) 10,995 3% 6% 10,654 Total Margin $ 21,587 1% 3% $ 21,387 Total Margin % 66% 67% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 57% 56% EMEA 28% 29% Asia Pacific 15% 15% Revenues by Offerings: Cloud services and license support(1) $ 26,727 2% 4% $ 26,269 Cloud license and on-premise license 5,855 1% 4% 5,772 Total revenues(1) $ 32,582 2% 4% $ 32,041 Revenues by Ecosystem: Applications revenues(1) $ 11,510 4% 6% $ 11,065 Infrastructure revenues(1) 21,072 0% 3% 20,976 Total revenues(1) $ 32,582 2% 4% $ 32,041 (1) Includes cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above for additional information. (2) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues, which was primarily due to increased customer purchases and renewals of cloud-based services and license support services in recent periods, contributions from our recent acquisitions and increased cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In constant currency, our total applications revenues and our total infrastructure revenues each grew during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 as customers continued to deploy our applications technologies and infrastructure technologies through different deployment models that we offer that enable customer choice. The Americas region contributed 43%, the EMEA region contributed 31% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 26% of the constant currency revenues growth for this business in fiscal 2019. In constant currency, total cloud and license expenses increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to higher sales and marketing expenses and higher cloud services and license support expenses, each of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses from higher headcount and due to higher technology infrastructure expenses. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license segment’s total margin increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased revenues, while total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to expenses growth. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Hardware Business Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware products. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased and renewed by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers, and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.

Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 due to lower hardware products revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower hardware support revenues. The decrease in hardware products revenues in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. This constant currency hardware revenue decrease was partially offset by certain hardware revenue increases related to our Oracle Engineered Systems offerings, primarily Oracle Exadata. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower hardware products and support costs and lower sales and marketing employee related expenses, all of which aligned to lower hardware revenues. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware segment increased in fiscal 2019 due to lower expenses. Services Business We offer services to customers and partners to help to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Services revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Services Revenues: Americas $ 1,576 -5% -3% $ 1,654 EMEA 1,021 -2% 2% 1,046 Asia Pacific 643 -7% -4% 695 Total revenues 3,240 -5% -2% 3,395 Total Expenses(1) 2,703 -1% 2% 2,729 Total Margin $ 537 -19% -18% $ 666 Total Margin % 17% 20% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 49% 49% EMEA 31% 31% Asia Pacific 20% 20% (1) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to revenue declines in our education services and, to a lesser extent, our consulting services. During fiscal 2019, constant currency increases in our EMEA-based services revenues were offset by constant currency services revenue decreases in the Americas and the Asia Pacific regions. In constant currency, total services expenses increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses and external contractor expenses associated with investments in our consulting services that support our cloud offerings. In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 due to decreased revenues and increased expenses for this business. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Research and development(1) $ 5,063 -2% 0% $ 5,163 Stock-based compensation 963 5% 5% 921 Total expenses $ 6,026 -1% 0% $ 6,084 % of Total Revenues 15% 15% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses were flat in fiscal 2019, as lower employee related expenses including lower variable compensation were offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for IT, finance, legal and human resources support functions; and professional services fees. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 General and administrative(1) $ 1,093 -1% 2% $ 1,102 Stock-based compensation 172 -5% -5% 180 Total expenses $ 1,265 -1% 1% $ 1,282 % of Total Revenues 3% 3% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased professional services fees. Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Developed technology $ 857 13% 14% $ 758 Cloud services and license support agreements and related relationships 712 -3% -3% 731 Other 120 -9% -9% 131 Total amortization of intangible assets $ 1,689 4% 4% $ 1,620 Amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to additional amortization from intangible assets, which primarily included developed technology that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, and certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. Stock-based compensation expenses included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed from acquisitions whereby vesting was accelerated generally upon termination of the employees pursuant to the original terms of those restricted stock-based awards and stock options.

Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Restructuring expenses $ 443 -25% -22% $ 588 Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2019 primarily related to our 2019 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2018 primarily related to our 2017 Restructuring Plan, which is substantially complete. Our management approved, committed to and initiated these plans in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, our management supplemented the 2019 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expect to take. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2019 Restructuring Plan are up to $584 million, of which approximately $108 million remained as of May 31, 2019, and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as the costs are incurred through an expected end date during fiscal 2020. Our estimated costs are subject to change in future periods. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans. Interest Expense: Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Interest expense $ 2,082 3% 3% $ 2,025 Interest expense increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in November 2017, which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting primarily from the maturities and repayments of $2.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2019 and $6.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2018. Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income, including net recognized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, net unrealized gains and losses related to certain equity securities and non-service net periodic pension income (losses). Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Interest income $ 1,092 -9% -9% $ 1,203 Foreign currency losses, net (111 ) 50% 62% (74 ) Noncontrolling interests in income (152 ) 12% 12% (135 ) Other income, net (14 ) -107% -42% 191 Total non-operating income, net $ 815 -31% -31% $ 1,185 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to decreases in other income, net in fiscal 2019, which was primarily attributable to realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities during fiscal 2018, and lower interest income in fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances during fiscal 2019. Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. In fiscal 2018, the Tax Act was signed into law. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described above under “Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2019 Actual Constant 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 1,185 -87% -86% $ 8,837 Effective tax rate 9.7% 71.1% Provision for income taxes decreased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the absence of the initial accounting charges related to the Tax Act that were recorded in fiscal 2018. To a lesser extent, provision for income taxes also decreased in fiscal 2019 due to the net favorable impacts of our final accounting for the Tax Act in fiscal 2019; the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile during fiscal 2019; the favorable impact of a tax benefit arising from an increase in a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure in fiscal 2019; and lower income before provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019. These decreases to our provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were partially offset both by lower excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2019, and by less favorable changes in net unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and other events in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 Change 2018 Working capital $ 27,756 -51% $ 57,035 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 37,827 -44% $ 67,261 Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2019 in comparison to May 31, 2018 was primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $4.5 billion of long-term senior notes as a current liability and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2019. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the favorable effects to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2019 and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from stock option exercises. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2019 in comparison to May 31, 2018 was primarily due to $36.1 billion used for repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $4.5 billion of borrowings, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. These cash 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements outflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2019 cash inflows, primarily cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2019. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2019, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2019 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from the May 31, 2018 balance sheet date. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 Change 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,551 -5% $ 15,386 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities $ 26,557 572% $ (5,625 ) Net cash used for financing activities $ (42,056 ) 321% $ (9,982 ) Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain unfavorable cash changes in working capital balances, primarily unfavorable changes associated with income taxes including the first installment payment made pursuant to the transition tax provisions of the Tax Act during fiscal 2019 (see additional discussion of future installment payments pursuant to the Tax Act’s transition tax under “Contractual Obligations” below). Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash provided by investing activities was $26.6 billion during fiscal 2019 compared to $5.6 billion of net cash used for investing during fiscal 2018. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of, and a decrease in purchases of, marketable securities and other investments. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased stock repurchases as we used $36.1 billion of cash to repurchase common stock during fiscal 2019 compared to $11.3 billion during fiscal 2018. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2019 Change 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,551 -5% $ 15,386 Capital expenditures (1,660 ) -4% (1,736 ) Free cash flow $ 12,891 -6% $ 13,650 Net income $ 11,083 $ 3,587 Free cash flow as a percent of net income 116% 381% Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.0 billion in fiscal 2019, $1.5 billion in 2018 and $912 million in fiscal 2017, respectively, or approximately 17%, 25% and 14%, respectively, of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Recent Financing Activities: Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2019, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.81 per share that totaled $2.9 billion. In June 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 31, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 17, 2019. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 17, 2018 and February 15, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $24.0 billion. As of May 31, 2019, approximately $5.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion, 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion, and 85.6 million shares for $3.5 billion in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our material contractual obligations as of May 31, 2019: Year Ending May 31, (in millions) Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 56,615 $ 4,500 $ 2,631 $ 8,250 $ 3,750 $ 3,500 $ 33,984 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 25,333 1,860 1,771 1,644 1,507 1,395 17,156 Operating leases(2) 2,381 658 538 425 262 165 333 Tax obligations(3) 6,462 416 576 576 576 1,080 3,238 Purchase obligations and other(4) 1,045 661 57 22 23 23 259 Total contractual obligations $ 91,836 $ 8,095 $ 5,573 $ 10,917 $ 6,118 $ 6,163 $ 54,970 (1) Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2019 after considering: • certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31, 2019 and are subject to change in future periods; • interest payments on our floating-rate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior notes as of May 31, 2019 and are subject to change in future periods; • certain cross-currency swap agreements for our €1.25 billion 2.25% senior notes due 2021 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements; and • certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for our €750 million 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2019 and the interest payments are subject to change in future periods. Refer to Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable and other borrowings and related derivative agreements. (2) Primarily represents leases of facilities, land, data centers, and vehicles and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring activities. We have approximately $58 million in facility obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2019. (3) Represents the future cash payments related to the transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. (4) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding; terms include: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. As of May 31, 2019, we had $7.6 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled. We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2020. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual data due to rounding. Refer to “Seasonality and Cyclicality” in Item 1 and “Business Overview” in Item 7 included elsewhere within this Annual Report for additional information regarding the seasonality of our revenues, expenses and margins. Fiscal 2019 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 9,193 $ 9,562 $ 9,614 $ 11,136 Gross profit $ 7,240 $ 7,561 $ 7,638 $ 9,073 Operating income $ 2,778 $ 3,101 $ 3,399 $ 4,257 Net income $ 2,265 $ 2,333 $ 2,745 $ 3,740 Earnings per share—basic $ 0.58 $ 0.63 $ 0.78 $ 1.10 Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.57 $ 0.61 $ 0.76 $ 1.07 Fiscal 2018 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues $ 9,104 $ 9,589 $ 9,676 $ 11,014 Gross profit $ 7,176 $ 7,629 $ 7,680 $ 8,840 Operating income $ 2,749 $ 3,039 $ 3,315 $ 4,161 Net income (loss) $ 2,144 $ 2,214 $ (4,047 ) $ 3,276 Earnings (loss) per share—basic $ 0.52 $ 0.53 $ (0.98 ) $ 0.81 Earnings (loss) per share—diluted $ 0.50 $ 0.52 $ (0.98 ) $ 0.79 Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2016 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards or stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2019, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, approximately 23% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2019, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.6%. During fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. The annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2019 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2019 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2016 427 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted 241 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed 16 Restricted stock-based awards vested and issued and stock options exercised (303 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (60 ) Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2019 321 Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 66 Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases (353 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2019 3,359 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2019 3,957 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2019 9.6% Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2019) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2019 8.0% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2019 1.7% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2019 -7.3% Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $37.8 billion and $67.3 billion as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2019, substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality with approximately 33% having maturity dates within one year and 67% having maturity dates within one to four years (a description of our marketable securities held is included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). We held a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. Fixed rate securities may have their market values adversely impacted as interest rates increase, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may vary due to changes in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31, 2019 and 2018 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $128 million and $308 million, respectively. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2019 and 2018, total interest income was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 2.08% and 1.73%, respectively, on a worldwide basis. Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk—Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were $56.3 billion as of May 31, 2019, consisting of $55.4 billion of fixed-rate borrowings, $750 million of floating-rate borrowings (Floating-Rate Notes) and $113 million of other borrowings. As of May 31, 2019, we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $2.0 billion of 2.25% fixed-rate senior notes due October 2019 (October 2019 Notes) and our $1.5 billion of 2.80% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes), so that the fixed-rate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. We have also entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our €750 million of 3.125% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2025 Notes (July 2025 Notes) by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the October 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes and July 2025 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The fair values of our outstanding fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2019 and 2018 were a $17 million net loss and a $26 million net loss, respectively. We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to an increase in forward interest rate prices. If LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, the change would have decreased the collective fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $90 million and $315 million, respectively. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements By issuing the Floating-Rate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2019 and 2018, if LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately $52 million and $86 million, respectively, as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating-rate borrowings. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2019 and 2018. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $111 million, $74 million and $152 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2019, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2019 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May 31, 2018. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars was a decrease of $158 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $57 million for fiscal 2018 and a decrease of $86 million in fiscal 2017. If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as of May 31, 2019 and May 31, 2018 the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $434 million and $555 million, respectively, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.",2023-12-30 16:56:22.222124
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. Business Overview Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on‑premise deployments, cloud‑based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud‑based deployment) such as our Oracle Cloud at Customer offering (an instance of Oracle Cloud in a customer’s own data center). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources. Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business For a discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to “Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business” included in Item 1 Business in this Annual Report, the risks included in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the information presented below in Results of Operations in this Item 7. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license line of business, which represented 83% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Cloud services and license support revenues include: • license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and • cloud services revenues, which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud‑based, on‑premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on‑premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage‑based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point in time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts as described above. Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue. Our cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to: • expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and • continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services. Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably; the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues ratably; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four quarterly periods. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Hardware Business Our hardware business, which represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Services Business Our services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced customer services and education services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including, our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; and tighter controls over customer discretionary spending. Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. The pace of our acquisitions has slowed recently, but as compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: • Revenue Recognition; • Business Combinations; • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; • Accounting for Income Taxes; and • Legal and Other Contingencies. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information about our critical and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition The most critical judgments required in applying Topic 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation. Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered. We use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. For a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In such situations, we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable. We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Accounting for Income Taxes Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Results of Operations Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses. In addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 results of each our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each business in the discussion below. Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation is noted to include any revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. In addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impractical to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on June 21, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2019, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2020 and 2019, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.10 million in fiscal 2020 (using 1.10 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.11 million in fiscal 2019 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2020 results using the fiscal 2019 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during either period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 21,563 -1% -1% $ 21,856 EMEA(1) 11,035 -2% 1% 11,270 Asia Pacific 6,470 1% 3% 6,380 Total revenues 39,068 -1% 0% 39,506 Total Operating Expenses 25,172 -3% -2% 25,971 Total Operating Margin $ 13,896 3% 4% $ 13,535 Total Operating Margin % 36% 34% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 55% 55% EMEA 28% 29% Asia Pacific 17% 16% Total Revenues by Business: Cloud and license $ 32,519 0% 1% $ 32,562 Hardware 3,443 -7% -6% 3,704 Services 3,106 -4% -3% 3,240 Total revenues $ 39,068 -1% 0% $ 39,506 % Revenues by Business: Cloud and license 83% 83% Hardware 9% 9% Services 8% 8% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues were flat in fiscal 2020. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud deployment models and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technologies and support services. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was due to reductions in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. The constant currency decrease in our services business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to declines in our consulting revenues and education revenues. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all three of our businesses’ revenues were adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and some of these effects may continue into fiscal 2021. While we expect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for fiscal 2021 and future periods are unknown. On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2020 total revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a decline in the Americas region. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower expenses for substantially all of our operating expense categories other than cloud services and license support expenses, which increased primarily due to headcount and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; and research and development expenses, which increased primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses. We curtailed a number of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 including marketing 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements expenses and employee travel expenses in response to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses to normalize in future periods provided global economic conditions improve. In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 due to the decline in our total expenses. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Cloud services and license support deferred revenues(1) $ 4 $ 20 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 1,586 1,689 Acquisition related and other(3)(5) 56 44 Restructuring(4) 250 443 Stock-based compensation, operating segments(5) 436 518 Stock-based compensation, R&D and G&A(5) 1,154 1,135 Income tax effects(6) (939 ) (1,406 ) Income tax reform(7) — (389 ) $ 2,547 $ 2,054 (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2020, estimated future amortization related to intangible assets was as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2021 $ 1,351 Fiscal 2022 1,102 Fiscal 2023 679 Fiscal 2024 445 Fiscal 2025 126 Thereafter 35 Total intangible assets, net $ 3,738 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. (4) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2020 and 2019 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2019 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in the discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (5) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2020 2019 Cloud services and license support $ 110 $ 99 Hardware 11 10 Services 54 49 Sales and marketing 261 360 Stock-based compensation, operating segments 436 518 Research and development 1,035 963 General and administrative 119 172 Total stock-based compensation $ 1,590 $ 1,653 (6) For fiscal 2020 and 2019, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items; and, for fiscal 2019, after excluding a tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure and a tax benefit as described in footnote (7) below, resulted in effective tax rates of 18.4% and 18.5% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, instead of 16.0% and 9.7%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations. (7) The fiscal 2019 income tax reform adjustment presented in the table above was due to an adjustment made pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: Oracle license support offerings; Oracle Cloud Services offerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Cloud and License Revenues: Americas(1) $ 18,314 -1% 0% $ 18,410 EMEA(1) 9,058 -1% 1% 9,168 Asia Pacific(1) 5,151 3% 4% 5,004 Total revenues(1) 32,523 0% 1% 32,582 Expenses: Cloud services and license support(2) 3,803 6% 7% 3,597 Sales and marketing(2) 7,159 -3% -2% 7,398 Total expenses(2) 10,962 0% 1% 10,995 Total Margin $ 21,561 0% 1% $ 21,587 Total Margin % 66% 66% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 56% 57% EMEA 28% 28% Asia Pacific 16% 15% Revenues by Offerings: Cloud services and license support(1) $ 27,396 3% 4% $ 26,727 Cloud license and on-premise license 5,127 -12% -11% 5,855 Total revenues(1) $ 32,523 0% 1% $ 32,582 Cloud Services and License Support Revenues by Ecosystem: Applications cloud services and license support(1) $ 11,019 4% 5% $ 10,572 Infrastructure cloud services and license support(1) 16,377 1% 3% 16,155 Total cloud services and license support revenues(1) $ 27,396 3% 4% $ 26,727 (1) Includes cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above for additional information. (2) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues, which was primarily due to increased customer purchases and renewals of cloud-based services and license support contracts in recent periods for which we delivered such services during fiscal 2020. Our cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 8%, 34% and 58%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2020. In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to higher cloud services and license support expenses during fiscal 2020, which were primarily attributable to higher employee related expenses and higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses, which were primarily due to our curtailment of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, including reduced marketing expenses and employee travel expenses, in response to COVID-19. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to the fiscal 2020 increases in revenues for this business, while total fiscal 2020 margins as a percentage of revenues remained flat. Hardware Business Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.

Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to lower hardware products revenues and lower hardware support revenues. The decreases in hardware products and hardware support revenues in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 were primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our hardware business’ revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the economic effects caused by COVID-19. These unfavorable 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements impacts to our fiscal 2020 hardware revenues were partially offset by increased hardware revenues related to certain of our strategic hardware offerings, namely our Oracle Exadata offerings. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower hardware products expenses, lower hardware support costs, and lower sales and marketing expenses, all of which aligned to lower hardware revenues. In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware business increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower hardware expenses. Services Business We offer services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

Also excludes certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to declines in our consulting services and education services revenues. Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts of consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and jurisdictional restrictions imposed with respect to in-person meetings. In addition, we incurred lower billable travel expenses and lower billable sub-contractor expenses for which we were to be reimbursed by our customers, which reduced the amount of revenues and expenses we reported for this business during fiscal 2020. In constant currency, total services expenses were flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as lower expenses incurred for travel and sub-contractors as described above and lower expenses related to the delivery of our education services were offset by higher employee related expenses associated with our consulting offerings during fiscal 2020. In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to the decrease in total revenues for this business. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Research and development(1) $ 5,032 -1% 0% $ 5,063 Stock-based compensation 1,035 7% 7% 963 Total expenses $ 6,067 1% 1% $ 6,026 % of Total Revenues 15% 15% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation On a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses, modestly higher employee salary expenses, and higher infrastructure expenses during fiscal 2020 that were partially offset by lower variable compensation expenses and lower travel expenses due to the impacts of COVID-19. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for IT, finance, legal and human resources support functions.

These decreases were partially offset by modestly higher fiscal 2020 employee salary expenses in constant currency. Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Developed technology $ 789 -8% -8% $ 857 Cloud services and license support agreements and related relationships 676 -5% -5% 712 Other 121 2% 2% 120 Total amortization of intangible assets $ 1,586 -6% -6% $ 1,689 Amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2020 due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized, partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Transitional and other employee related costs $ 12 -77% -77% $ 49 Business combination adjustments, net (7 ) -67% -71% (21 ) Other, net 51 227% 228% 16 Total acquisition related and other expenses $ 56 27% 29% $ 44 On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2020 due to higher other expenses, net including asset impairment costs related to certain right of use assets and other assets that were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operations prospectively. In addition, during fiscal 2019 we recorded certain business combination related adjustments that benefited our expenses during this period. These increases to our fiscal 2020 expenses growth were partially offset by lower fiscal 2020 transitional employee related costs. Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. Prior to fiscal 2020, restructuring expenses also included charges for duplicate facilities. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Restructuring expenses $ 250 -44% -42% $ 443 Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2020 and 2019 primarily related to our 2019 Restructuring Plan. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2019 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans. The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2019 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing and selling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Cost savings that are expected to be realized pursuant to our 2019 Restructuring Plan initiatives may be offset by investments in resources and geographies that best address the development, marketing and sale of our cloud‑based offerings including investments in our second‑generation cloud infrastructure. Interest Expense: Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Interest expense $ 1,995 -4% -4% $ 2,082 Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the maturities and repayments of $4.5 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2020 and $2.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2019. This decrease in interest expense during fiscal 2020 was partially offset by additional interest expense incurred related to our issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes in April 2020. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income (losses), including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, net unrealized gains and losses related to certain equity securities and non-service net periodic pension income (losses).

Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Provision for income taxes $ 1,928 63% 66% $ 1,185 Effective tax rate 16.0% 9.7% Provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2020 of tax benefits we recorded in fiscal 2019 attributable to changes in estimates related to our adoption of the Tax Act, as recorded pursuant to SAB 118, and the increase of a deferred tax asset associated with the partial realignment of our legal structure. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020 Change 2019 Working capital $ 34,940 26% $ 27,756 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 43,057 14% $ 37,827 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior notes in April 2020 (refer to Recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2020 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2020, and the prospective recognition of current operating lease liabilities associated with our adoption of Topic 842 as of June 1, 2019. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior notes in April 2020, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2020. These cash inflows were partially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $19.2 billion used for repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $4.5 billion of borrowings, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2020, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2020 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from the May 31, 2019 balance sheet date. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020 Change 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,139 -10% $ 14,551 Net cash provided by investing activities $ 9,843 -63% $ 26,557 Net cash used for financing activities $ (6,132 ) -85% $ (42,056 ) Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower net income and certain cash unfavorable changes in the timing of payments received from customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which we believe were attributable to the unfavorable global economic effects that resulted from COVID-19. We expect to collect substantially all of these delayed customer payments in future periods. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Net cash provided by investing activities decreased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to a fiscal 2020 decrease in proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities and other investments and a fiscal 2020 increase in the purchase of marketable securities and other investments, in each case relative to fiscal 2019. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in our stock repurchases for which we used $19.2 billion in fiscal 2020 in comparison to $36.1 billion in fiscal 2019; and our fiscal 2020 issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes (none in fiscal 2019). Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020 Change 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,139 -10% $ 14,551 Capital expenditures (1,564 ) -6% (1,660 ) Free cash flow $ 11,575 -10% $ 12,891 Net income $ 10,135 $ 11,083 Free cash flow as percent of net income 114% 116% Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.0 billion in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018 or approximately 19%, 17% and 25%, respectively, of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Recent Financing Activities: Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2020, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.96 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 28, 2020 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2020. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Senior Notes: In April 2020, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following: • $3.50 billion of 2.50% senior notes due April 2025; • $2.25 billion of 2.80% senior notes due April 2027; • $3.25 billion of 2.95% senior notes due April 2030; • $3.00 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2040; • $4.50 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2050; and 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • $3.50 billion of 3.85% senior notes due April 2060. We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, we repaid $4.5 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regarding our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019 and March 12, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As of May 31, 2020, approximately $16.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion, 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our material contractual obligations as of May 31, 2020: Year Ending May 31, (in millions) Total 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $ 72,115 $ 2,631 $ 8,250 $ 3,750 $ 3,500 $ 10,000 $ 43,984 Interest payments on borrowings(1) 37,664 2,431 2,291 2,150 2,038 1,926 26,828 Operating leases(2) 2,315 616 519 350 252 192 386 Tax obligations(3) 6,046 576 576 576 1,080 1,440 1,798 Purchase obligations and other(4) 1,263 881 66 30 27 23 236 Total contractual obligations $ 119,403 $ 7,135 $ 11,702 $ 6,856 $ 6,897 $ 13,581 $ 73,232 (1) Represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2020 after considering: • certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOR-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31, 2020 and are subject to change in future periods; • certain cross-currency swap agreements for our €1.25 billion 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements; and • certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for our €750 million 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2020 and the interest payments are subject to change in future periods. Refer to Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable and other borrowings and related derivative agreements. (2) Represents operating lease liabilities for facilities, data centers, and vehicles. (3) Represents the future cash payments related to the transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (4) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding; terms include: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. As of May 31, 2020, we had $8.4 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2021. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Selected Quarterly Financial Data The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual data due to rounding. Refer to “Seasonality and Cyclicality” in Item 1 and “Business Overview” in Item 7 included elsewhere within this Annual Report for additional information regarding the seasonality of our revenues, expenses and margins and the impacts of COVID-19 on our business during fiscal 2020.

We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2017 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.5% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2020, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, substantially all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2020, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.0%. During fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. The annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. However, we currently do not expect that the annual grant for fiscal 2021 will be approved during this time period. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2020 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2020 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2017 395 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted 231 Restricted stock-based awards vested and issued and stock options exercised (286 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (63 ) Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2020 277 Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 56 Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases (444 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2020 3,067 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2020 3,655 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2020 9.0% Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2020) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2020 9.0% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2020 1.5% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2020 -10.6% Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $43.1 billion and $37.8 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2020, substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality with substantially all having maturity dates within one year (a description of our marketable securities held is included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). We held a mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. Fixed rate securities may have their market values adversely impacted as interest rates increase, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may vary due to changes in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31, 2020 and 2019 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $15 million and $128 million, respectively. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal 2020 and 2019, total interest income was $527 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 1.47% and 2.08%, respectively, on a worldwide basis. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk—Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were $71.6 billion as of May 31, 2020, consisting of $71.5 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings. As of May 31, 2020, we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion of 2.80% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes), so that the fixed-rate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. We have also entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our €750 million of 3.125% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2025 Notes (July 2025 Notes) by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated debt, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2021 Notes and July 2025 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The fair values of our outstanding fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2020 and 2019 were a $12 million net gain and a $17 million net loss, respectively. We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were primarily attributable to a decrease and increase, respectively, in forward interest rate prices. If LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the change would have decreased the collective fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by $63 million and $90 million, respectively. By entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2020 and 2019, if LIBOR-based interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points, the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately $24 million and $52 million, respectively, as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and related borrowings, and as of May 31, 2019, as it related to our floating-rate borrowings. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2020 and 2019. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $185 million and $111 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown. Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2020, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2020 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May 31, 2019. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars was a decrease of $125 million and $158 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019 the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $491 million and $434 million, respectively, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.",2023-12-30 16:56:26.919012
1341439,ORCL,ORACLE CORP,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on June 22, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor. Business Overview Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise deployments, cloud‑based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud‑based deployment) such as our Oracle Cloud@Customer offering (an instance of Oracle Cloud in a customer’s own data center). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources. Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business For a discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to “Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business” included in Item 1 Business in this Annual Report, the risks included in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the information presented below in “Results of Operations” in this Item 7. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business, which represented 84% and 83% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are: • Cloud services and license support revenues, which include: o license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and o cloud services revenues, which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; generally have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time. • Cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above. Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, hardware revenues and services revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services and license support revenues represented 71%, 70% and 68% of our total revenues during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to: • expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and • continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms; the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues ratably; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four quarterly periods. Hardware Business Our hardware business, which represented 8% and 9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners’ abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Services Business Our services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2021 and 2020, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. The pace of our acquisitions has slowed in recent years, but as compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: • Revenue Recognition; • Business Combinations; • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; • Accounting for Income Taxes; and • Legal and Other Contingencies. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information about our critical and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition The most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606, Revenue Recognition from Customers, and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation. Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple products and services 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered. We use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. For a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In such situations, we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable. We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Accounting for Income Taxes Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses. In addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below. Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation is noted to include any revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. In addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses or income, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impractical to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before provision for income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. We experienced COVID-19 related impacts to our business during fiscal 2021 and 2020. Certain of these historical impacts on our operating results are further discussed below. Any future impacts are currently unknown. Separately, as described further below and in Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we recorded a $2.3 billion non-recurring net deferred tax benefit during fiscal 2021 that related to a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2020, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2021 and 2020, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.19 million in fiscal 2021 (using 1.19 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.10 million in fiscal 2020 (using 1.10 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2021 results using the fiscal 2020 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 Actual Constant 2020 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 21,828 1% 2% $ 21,563 EMEA(1) 11,894 8% 2% 11,035 Asia Pacific 6,757 4% 1% 6,470 Total revenues 40,479 4% 2% 39,068 Total Operating Expenses 25,266 0% -1% 25,172 Total Operating Margin $ 15,213 9% 6% $ 13,896 Total Operating Margin % 38% 36% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 54% 55% EMEA 29% 28% Asia Pacific 17% 17% Total Revenues by Business: Cloud and license $ 34,099 5% 3% $ 32,519 Hardware 3,359 -2% -4% 3,443 Services 3,021 -3% -5% 3,106 Total revenues $ 40,479 4% 2% $ 39,068 % Revenues by Business: Cloud and license 84% 83% Hardware 8% 9% Services 8% 8% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2021. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our non-strategic hardware products and related support services. The constant currency decrease in our services business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a decline in our consulting revenues. All three of our businesses’ revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and some of these effects may continue into fiscal 2022. While we expect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for future periods are unknown. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 54%, 39% and 7%, respectively, to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2021. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses, lower hardware expenses and lower services expenses, all of which were primarily attributable to lower headcount and a reduction in certain variable expenditures as further described below. In addition, we also incurred lower amortization of intangible assets during fiscal 2021. These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by certain constant currency expense increases during fiscal 2021, primarily: higher cloud services and license support expenses, which increased primarily due to higher infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; higher research and development and general and administrative expenses, each of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses; higher acquisition related and other expenses, which increased primarily due to certain right-of-use assets and other assets that were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operations; and higher restructuring expenses, which increased due to actions taken during fiscal 2021 pursuant to the Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2019 Restructuring Plan). During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we curtailed a number of variable expenditures across all of our lines of businesses and functions including employee travel expenses and marketing expenses, among others, primarily in response to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses may normalize in future periods provided global economic and health conditions improve. In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2021 due to higher total revenues and lower total operating expenses. In fiscal 2022, we expect to accelerate our investments primarily in our cloud and license business. We expect fiscal 2022 total expenses growth to exceed total revenues growth and, as a result, our fiscal 2022 total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues to be modestly lower relative to fiscal 2021. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Cloud services and license support deferred revenues(1) $ 2 $ 4 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 1,379 1,586 Acquisition related and other(3) 138 56 Restructuring(4) 431 250 Stock-based compensation, operating segments(5) 513 436 Stock-based compensation, R&D and G&A(5) 1,324 1,154 Income tax effects(6) (3,408 ) (939 ) $ 379 $ 2,547 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2021, estimated future amortization related to intangible assets was as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2022 $ 1,122 Fiscal 2023 698 Fiscal 2024 453 Fiscal 2025 123 Fiscal 2026 24 Thereafter 10 Total intangible assets, net $ 2,430 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. (4) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2021 and 2020 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our 2019 Restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in management’s discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. (5) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2021 2020 Cloud services and license support $ 134 $ 110 Hardware 11 11 Services 55 54 Sales and marketing 313 261 Stock-based compensation, operating segments 513 436 Research and development 1,188 1,035 General and administrative 136 119 Total stock-based compensation $ 1,837 $ 1,590 (6) For fiscal 2021, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items, and after excluding a $2.3 billion tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure and any related deferred tax expense (refer to Notes 1 and 14 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information), resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.9%, instead of (5.7%), which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations. For fiscal 2020, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after adjusting for the effects of items within the table above, such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items, resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.4%, instead of 16.0%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: Oracle license support offerings; Oracle cloud services offerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 Actual Constant 2020 Cloud and License Revenues: Americas(1) $ 18,783 3% 3% $ 18,314 EMEA 9,928 10% 4% 9,058 Asia Pacific 5,390 5% 1% 5,151 Total revenues(1) 34,101 5% 3% 32,523 Expenses: Cloud services and license support(2) 4,133 9% 7% 3,803 Sales and marketing(2) 6,799 -5% -6% 7,159 Total expenses(2) 10,932 0% -2% 10,962 Total Margin $ 23,169 7% 5% $ 21,561 Total Margin % 68% 66% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 55% 56% EMEA 29% 28% Asia Pacific 16% 16% Revenues by Offerings: Cloud services and license support(1) $ 28,702 5% 3% $ 27,396 Cloud license and on-premise license 5,399 5% 2% 5,127 Total revenues(1) $ 34,101 5% 3% $ 32,523 Cloud Services and License Support Revenues by Ecosystem: Applications cloud services and license support(1) $ 11,713 6% 5% $ 11,019 Infrastructure cloud services and license support(1) 16,989 4% 2% 16,377 Total cloud services and license support revenues(1) $ 28,702 5% 3% $ 27,396 (1) Includes cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above for additional information. (2) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support for which we delivered such cloud and support services during fiscal 2021. The growth in our cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impacts of COVID-19 for future periods are unknown. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 57%, 38% and 5%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2021. In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower sales and marketing expenses, which decreased primarily due to lower employee related expenses and our curtailment of variable expenditures, including lower employee travel expenses and lower 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements marketing expenses, primarily in response to COVID-19. These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by higher cloud services and license support expenses during fiscal 2021, which were primarily attributable to higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods and, in fiscal 2022, we expect this growth to accelerate as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the fiscal 2021 increases in total revenues and the decreases in total expenses for this business. Hardware Business Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 Actual Constant 2020 Hardware Revenues: Americas $ 1,650 -6% -6% $ 1,758 EMEA 989 -1% -4% 998 Asia Pacific 720 5% 1% 687 Total revenues 3,359 -2% -4% 3,443 Expenses: Hardware products and support(1) 945 -13% -14% 1,084 Sales and marketing(1) 388 -15% -16% 456 Total expenses(1) 1,333 -13% -14% 1,540 Total Margin $ 2,026 6% 5% $ 1,903 Total Margin % 60% 55% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 49% 51% EMEA 30% 29% Asia Pacific 21% 20% (1) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Our constant currency hardware revenues declined in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de- 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our non-strategic hardware products and related support services, the net impact of which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our hardware business’ revenues were also adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 by the unfavorable economic effects caused by COVID-19. Geographically, we experienced constant currency revenue declines in all regions during fiscal 2021, other than Asia Pacific. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower hardware product expenses, lower hardware support costs and lower sales and marketing costs, all of which aligned to lower hardware revenues. In constant currency, our hardware business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower total expenses for this business. Services Business We offer services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 Actual Constant 2020 Services Revenues: Americas $ 1,397 -7% -6% $ 1,496 EMEA 977 0% -5% 979 Asia Pacific 647 2% -1% 631 Total revenues 3,021 -3% -5% 3,106 Total Expenses(1) 2,393 -10% -12% 2,656 Total Margin $ 628 39% 37% $ 450 Total Margin % 21% 14% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 46% 48% EMEA 32% 32% Asia Pacific 22% 20% (1) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain allocations. Also excludes certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decline in our consulting revenues. Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 by the impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts of consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and in-person meeting restrictions imposed by certain jurisdictions. In addition, we incurred lower billable travel expenses and lower billable sub-contractor expenses for which we would have been reimbursed by our customers, which reduced the amount of revenues and expenses we reported for our services business during fiscal 2021 and 2020. Geographically, we experienced constant currency revenue declines in all regions during fiscal 2021. In constant currency, total services expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower employee related costs caused by lower headcount in addition to lower travel and sub-contractor expenses as described above. In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues increased during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 due to lower total expenses for this business. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower travel expenses during fiscal 2021 primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for IT, finance, legal and human resources support functions.

These increases were partially offset by lower salary expenses due to lower headcount, and by lower travel expenses and certain other variable expense curtailments that we implemented during fiscal 2021 primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. In addition, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2021 were unfavorably affected in comparison to the prior year due to a $29 million litigation related benefit that reduced our expenses during fiscal 2020. Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization.

Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments, including adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.

Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 Actual Constant 2020 Restructuring expenses $ 431 73% 66% $ 250 Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2021 and 2020 primarily related to our 2019 Restructuring Plan, which is substantially complete. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2019 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans. The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2019 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing and selling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Certain of the cost savings realized pursuant to our 2019 Restructuring Plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that better address the development, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud‑based offerings including investments in our second‑generation cloud infrastructure. Interest Expense: Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 Actual Constant 2020 Interest expense $ 2,496 25% 25% $ 1,995 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 substantially due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $15.0 billion of senior notes in March 2021 and $20.0 billion of senior notes in March 2020. Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income and expenses, including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, net unrealized gains and losses related to equity securities and non-service net periodic pension income and losses.

These increases in non-operating income, net were partially offset by lower interest income that we recognized in fiscal 2021, which was caused by lower average interest rates that were applicable to our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Benefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021 Change 2020 Working capital $ 31,403 -10% $ 34,940 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 46,554 8% $ 43,057 Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $8.3 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2021. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021 (refer to Recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2021 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2021. These cash inflows during fiscal 2021 were partially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $20.9 billion for settled repurchases of our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, the repayment of $2.6 billion related to our borrowings, and cash used for capital expenditures. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2021, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased on a net basis as of May 31, 2021 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from the May 31, 2020 balance sheet date. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021 Change 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 15,887 21% $ 13,139 Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities $ (13,098 ) * $ 9,843 Net cash used for financing activities $ (10,378 ) 69% $ (6,132 ) * Not meaningful Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher net income, higher cash collections from customers, a portion of which were previously delayed due to the global economic effects that resulted from COVID-19, and certain other cash favorable working capital changes, in each case in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash used for investing activities was $13.1 billion during fiscal 2021 in comparison to net cash provided by investing activities of $9.8 billion during fiscal 2020. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in cash used for the purchases of marketable securities and other investments and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and other investments, in each case during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2022, we expect our capital expenditures could nearly double relative to fiscal 2021, primarily to increase data center capacities and geographic locations to meet current and expected customer demand for our cloud services. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by lower debt repayments and higher cash proceeds from stock option exercises, in each case during fiscal 2021 in comparison to fiscal 2020. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021 Change 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 15,887 21% $ 13,139 Capital expenditures (2,135 ) 37% (1,564 ) Free cash flow $ 13,752 19% $ 11,575 Net income $ 13,746 $ 10,135 Free cash flow as percent of net income 100% 114% Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and other services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $941 million in fiscal 2021 and $1.0 billion in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Recent Financing Activities: Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.04 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 29, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2021. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Senior Notes: In March 2021, we issued $15.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following: • $2.75 billion of 1.65% senior notes due March 2026; • $2.00 billion of 2.30% senior notes due March 2028; • $3.25 billion of 2.875% senior notes due March 2031; • $2.25 billion of 3.65% senior notes due March 2041; • $3.25 billion of 3.95% senior notes due March 2051; and • $1.50 billion of 4.10% senior notes due March 2061. We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, we repaid $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regarding our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 10, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $20.0 billion. As of May 31, 2021, approximately $15.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion, 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion, and 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Contractual Obligations: Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2021 consisted of: • principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments; • routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; • operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; and • other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. In addition, as of May 31, 2021, we had $8.5 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2022. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. Notes 7, 11, 14 and 17 of 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our contractual obligations and contingencies. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2018 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.0% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2021, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2021, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 7.7%. During fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2021 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2018 393 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted 164 Restricted stock-based awards vested and issued and stock options exercised (267 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (73 ) Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2021 217 Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 31 Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases (475 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2021 2,814 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 3,263 Restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2021 7.7% Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2021) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2021 7.7% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 1.0% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 -13.6% Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $46.6 billion and $43.1 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our bank deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2021, substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality, fixed-rate debt securities and had maturity dates within one year (a description of the types of marketable securities held as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 is included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). The market values of our fixed-rate marketable securities investments are adversely impacted as interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, we may realize losses if we sell securities prior to their scheduled maturities that declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify substantially all of our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record changes in their fair values to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets, no gains or losses are recognized in our earnings due to market changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to expected credit loss. We generally do not use our marketable debt securities investments for trading purposes. Borrowings and Related Fair Value Hedges Our total borrowings were $84.2 billion as of May 31, 2021, consisting of $84.1 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings, compared to $71.6 billion as of May 31, 2020, consisting of $71.5 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings. With the exception of those senior notes for which we have 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements corresponding fair value hedges that are recorded at their fair values as of each reporting period and discussed further below, we record all of our fixed-rate borrowings at amortized cost and therefore, any changes in interest rates do not impact the values that we report for these senior notes or our consolidated financial statements. As of May 31, 2021, we held certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest rate obligations associated with certain of our senior notes to variable interest rate obligations based on LIBOR that we have designated as fair value hedges, among certain other effects. Consequently, these swap agreements are recorded at their fair values at each reporting period and incur gains and losses due to changes in market interest rates but are substantially offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related senior notes for which the swap agreements pertained. By entering into these swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Changes in interest rates affected the interest expense that we recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and the values that we report for these instruments as of each reporting date. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Translation Risk As described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, total revenues and total expense that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies. Our principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Saudi Arabian Riyal, Indian Rupee and British Pound. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions. We have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for trading purposes. We realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, and we also incur costs to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, substantially all of which are included in non-operating income, net in our consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. Refer to Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sensitivity Analysis The following table sets forth the hypothetical potential losses that we consider to be the most material to the fair values of our interest rate and currency influenced holdings, including associated derivatives, or future earnings resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates as of or for the reporting periods below: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) Hypothetical Change Impact 2021 2020 Interest rate risk: Marketable securities 50 basis points increase in interest rates Fair values $ (23 ) $ (15 ) Interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements 100 basis points increase in interest rates Fair values $ (37 ) $ (63 ) Interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements 100 basis points increase in interest rates Earnings $ (24 ) $ (24 ) Foreign currency risk: Total revenues 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates Earnings $ (2,061 ) $ (1,942 ) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates Fair values $ (650 ) $ (491 )",2023-12-30 16:56:25.921201

Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise deployments, cloud-based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business, which represented 85% and 84% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are: • Cloud services and license support revenues, which include: o license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and o cloud services revenues, which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; generally have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time. • Cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above. Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, hardware revenues and services revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services and license support revenues represented 71% of our total revenues during each of fiscal 2022 and 2021 and 70% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020. Our cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to: • expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and • continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services. Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods. Hardware Business Our hardware business, which represented 7% and 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners’ abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, with this factor becoming more pronounced in recent periods due to global supply chain constraints for certain technology components; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Services Business Our services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2022 and 2021, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. As compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. On December 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Cerner Corporation (Cerner), a provider of digital information systems used within hospitals and health systems that are designed to enable medical professionals to deliver better healthcare to individual patients and communities, for a preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $28.2 billion. The transaction closed on June 8, 2022. Notes 2 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our acquisition of Cerner and our other recent acquisitions. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include: • Revenue Recognition; • Business Combinations; • Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments; • Accounting for Income Taxes; and • Legal and Other Contingencies. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information about our critical and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition The most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606, Revenue Recognition from Customers, and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. We use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues. Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In such situations, we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable. We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Accounting for Income Taxes Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Results of Operations Recent Global Events Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Neither of the aforementioned countries, nor Ukraine, have composed or are expected to compose a material portion of Oracle’s total consolidated revenues, net income, net assets, or workforce. We serve hundreds of thousands of customers globally across a broad geographic and industry base. We are profitable and generate a large amount of positive cash flow from our operations, and we do not believe the current posture of the Russia-Ukraine situation will jeopardize either of these characteristics of our business. Other impacts due to this rapidly evolving situation are currently unknown and could potentially subject our business to materially adverse consequences. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition, for a discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to the risks included in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the information presented below in Results of Operations in this Item 7. Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses. In addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below. Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation for fiscal 2021 is noted to include any revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2021 due to certain business combination accounting requirements that were eliminated in fiscal 2022. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2021. In addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses or income, net and (provision for) benefit from income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2022 and 2021. We experienced COVID-19 related impacts to our businesses during fiscal 2022 and 2021. Certain of these historical impacts to our operating results are further discussed below. Any future impacts are currently unknown. Separately, • as described further below and in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we remitted and recorded $4.7 billion for certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022; • as described further above, Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Oracle recorded fiscal 2022 revenues of $248 million from these two countries, a reduction of $118 million relative to fiscal 2021. No revenues are expected to be recognized from these two countries prospectively; and • as described further below and in Notes 1 and 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we recorded a $2.3 billion one-time net deferred tax benefit during fiscal 2021 that related to a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2021, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2022 and 2021, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.07 million in fiscal 2022 (using 1.07 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.22 million in fiscal 2021 (using 1.22 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2022 results using the fiscal 2021 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Total Revenues by Geography: Americas $ 23,679 8% 8% $ 21,828 EMEA(1) 12,011 1% 5% 11,894 Asia Pacific 6,750 0% 4% 6,757 Total revenues 42,440 5% 7% 40,479 Total Operating Expenses 31,514 25% 26% 25,266 Total Operating Margin $ 10,926 -28% -25% $ 15,213 Total Operating Margin % 26% 38% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 56% 54% EMEA 28% 29% Asia Pacific 16% 17% Total Revenues by Business: Cloud and license $ 36,052 6% 7% $ 34,099 Hardware 3,183 -5% -3% 3,359 Services 3,205 6% 8% 3,021 Total revenues $ 42,440 5% 7% $ 40,479 % Revenues by Business: Cloud and license 85% 84% Hardware 7% 8% Services 8% 8% (1) Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2022 due to growth in our cloud and license business’ revenues and services business’ revenues, which were partially offset by a decline in our hardware business’ revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models. Customers also renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services. The constant currency increase in our services business’ revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was attributable to an increase in revenues for each of our primary services offerings. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our non-strategic hardware products and related support services. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 68%, 22% and 10%, respectively, to our total revenue growth during fiscal 2022. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 substantially due to certain litigation related charges recorded to acquisition related and other expenses as further described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition, our total operating expenses increased due to higher cloud services and license support expenses, which were primarily due to higher employee related expenses and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; higher services expenses, which increased primarily due to higher employee related and external contractor expenses; and higher research and development and general and administrative expenses, both of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets, lower restructuring expenses and by $250 million of gains from operating asset sales, which were allocated across most of our operating expense lines during fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022 and 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2021, we curtailed certain variable expenditures including employee travel expenses, among others, primarily in response to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses may normalize in future periods provided global economic and health conditions improve. In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased in fiscal 2022, relative to fiscal 2021, substantially due to the unfavorable impact of the fiscal 2022 litigation related charges referenced above, partially offset by higher fiscal 2022 total margin generated by our operating segments and the aforementioned gains from operating asset sales during fiscal 2022. Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Cloud services and license support deferred revenues(1) $ — $ 2 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 1,150 1,379 Acquisition related and other(3) 4,713 138 Restructuring(4) 191 431 Stock-based compensation, operating segments(5) 735 513 Stock-based compensation, R&D and G&A(5) 1,878 1,324 Income tax effects(6) (1,723 ) (3,408 ) $ 6,944 $ 379 (1) Due to business combination accounting rules that were applicable to acquisitions closed prior to fiscal 2022, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed and did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts presented in the above table for fiscal 2021 that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. (2) Represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2022, estimated future amortization related to intangible assets was as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2023 $ 750 Fiscal 2024 508 Fiscal 2025 148 Fiscal 2026 24 Fiscal 2027 6 Thereafter 4 Total intangible assets, net $ 1,440 (3) Acquisition related and other expenses consisted of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net. For fiscal 2022, acquisition related and other expenses also included certain litigation related charges as further described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We consider the litigation related charges that are included in this line item to be outside our ordinary course of business based on the following considerations: (i) the unprecedented nature of the litigation related charges including the nature and size of the damages awarded; (ii) the dissimilarity of this litigation and related charges to recurring litigation of which we are a party in the normal course of business, for which any and all such charges are included in our GAAP operating results and are not separately quantified and disclosed within this line item or any other line in the table presented above; (iii) the complexity of the case; (iv) the counterparty involved; and (v) our expectation that litigation related charges of this nature will not recur in future periods; among other factors. (4) Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2022 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2022 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2022 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during fiscal 2021 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2019 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in management’s discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses,” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (5) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions): Year Ended May 31, 2022 2021 Cloud services and license support $ 205 $ 134 Hardware 15 11 Services 67 55 Sales and marketing 448 313 Stock-based compensation, operating segments 735 513 Research and development 1,633 1,188 General and administrative 245 136 Total stock-based compensation $ 2,613 $ 1,837 (6) For fiscal 2022, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain acquisition related and other items, and after excluding the net deferred tax effects associated with a previously recorded income tax benefit that resulted from a partial realignment of our legal entity structure, resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.3%, instead of 12.2%, which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations. For fiscal 2021, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items, and after excluding a $2.3 billion net tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure and any related deferred tax expense resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.9%, instead of (5.7%), which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations. Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: Oracle license support offerings; Oracle Cloud Services offerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021(1) Cloud and License Revenues: Americas $ 20,594 10% 10% $ 18,783 EMEA 10,016 1% 5% 9,928 Asia Pacific 5,442 1% 5% 5,390 Total revenues 36,052 6% 7% 34,101 Expenses: Cloud services and license support(2) 4,915 19% 20% 4,133 Sales and marketing(2) 7,054 4% 5% 6,799 Total expenses(2) 11,969 9% 11% 10,932 Total Margin $ 24,083 4% 6% $ 23,169 Total Margin % 67% 68% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 57% 55% EMEA 28% 29% Asia Pacific 15% 16% Revenues by Offerings: Cloud services and license support(1) $ 30,174 5% 6% $ 28,702 Cloud license and on-premise license 5,878 9% 12% 5,399 Total revenues(1) $ 36,052 6% 7% $ 34,101 Cloud Services and License Support Revenues by Ecosystem: Applications cloud services and license support $ 12,612 8% 8% $ 11,713 Infrastructure cloud services and license support 17,562 3% 5% 16,989 Total cloud services and license support revenues $ 30,174 5% 6% $ 28,702 (1) Revenues presented for fiscal 2021 included cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2021 due to business combination accounting rules that were applicable to acquisitions closed prior to fiscal 2022. Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for fiscal 2021 for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above for additional information. (2) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support for which we delivered such cloud and support services during fiscal 2022. Our total cloud services revenues increased to $10.8 billion in fiscal 2022 from $8.9 billion in fiscal 2021 due to growth in our Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 71%, 18% and 11%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2022. In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to higher cloud services and license support expenses, primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to higher headcount and higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; and higher sales and marketing expenses, primarily due to higher employee related expenses from higher headcount. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by an allocation of a portion of the gains from fiscal 2022 operating asset sales as described above. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods and we expect this growth to continue to accelerate in 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements fiscal 2023 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to fiscal 2022 increases in total revenues for this business, while total fiscal 2022 margin as a percentage of revenues for this business decreased slightly due to expenses growth. Hardware Business Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Hardware Revenues: Americas $ 1,558 -6% -6% $ 1,650 EMEA 949 -4% 1% 989 Asia Pacific 676 -6% -3% 720 Total revenues 3,183 -5% -3% 3,359 Expenses: Hardware products and support(1) 944 0% 2% 945 Sales and marketing(1) 361 -7% -5% 388 Total expenses(1) 1,305 -2% 0% 1,333 Total Margin $ 1,878 -7% -5% $ 2,026 Total Margin % 59% 60% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 49% 49% EMEA 30% 30% Asia Pacific 21% 21% (1) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Our constant currency hardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021, primarily due to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies and strategic hardware offerings and the de-emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our nonstrategic hardware products, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our hardware business’ revenues were also adversely impacted during fiscal 2022 and 2021 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including global supply chain shortages for technology components that resulted in certain manufacturing delays, and any such prospective impacts are unknown. Geographically, we experienced constant currency revenue declines in the Americas and the Asia Pacific regions during fiscal 2022, partially offset by constant currency revenue increases in the EMEA region. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses were flat in fiscal 2022, relative to the corresponding prior year period. In constant currency, our hardware business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to lower total revenues for this business. Services Business Our services offerings are designed to help maximize the performance of customer investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies and substantially include our consulting services and advanced customer services offerings. Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Services Revenues: Americas $ 1,527 9% 9% $ 1,397 EMEA 1,046 7% 11% 977 Asia Pacific 632 -2% 1% 647 Total revenues 3,205 6% 8% 3,021 Total Expenses(1) 2,539 6% 8% 2,393 Total Margin $ 666 6% 9% $ 628 Total Margin % 21% 21% % Revenues by Geography: Americas 48% 46% EMEA 32% 32% Asia Pacific 20% 22% (1) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain allocations. Also excludes certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues increased in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 primarily due to revenue increases in each of our primary services offerings. In constant currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 53%, 44% and 3%, respectively, to the revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2022. In constant currency, total services expenses increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to higher headcount and higher external contractor expenses. In constant currency, our services business’ total margin increased during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 due to higher total revenues for this business. In constant currency, total margin as a percentage of total services revenues was flat during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Research and development(1) $ 5,586 5% 5% $ 5,339 Stock-based compensation 1,633 38% 38% 1,188 Total expenses $ 7,219 11% 11% $ 6,527 % of Total Revenues 17% 16% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation On a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to increased headcount and higher stock-based compensation expenses. This constant currency expense increase was partially offset by an allocation of gains from fiscal 2022 operating asset sales as described above. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for IT, finance, legal and human resources support functions. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 General and administrative(1) $ 1,072 -4% -3% $ 1,118 Stock-based compensation 245 79% 79% 136 Total expenses $ 1,317 5% 6% $ 1,254 % of Total Revenues 3% 3% (1) Excluding stock-based compensation Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses. This constant currency expense increase was partially offset by an allocation of gains from fiscal 2022 operating asset sales as described above. Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Developed technology $ 475 -24% -23% $ 621 Cloud services and license support agreements and related relationships 592 -11% -11% 669 Other 83 -7% -7% 89 Total amortization of intangible assets $ 1,150 -17% -17% $ 1,379 Amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2022 due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized, partially offset by a smaller amount of additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions. Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments, including adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Transitional and other employee related costs $ 10 88% 87% $ 5 Business combination adjustments, net 9 109% 108% 4 Other, net 4,694 * * 129 Total acquisition related and other expenses $ 4,713 * * $ 138 * Not meaningful On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2022 due to litigation related charges of $4.7 billion, which we generally do not expect to recur, as further described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Restructuring Expenses: Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs, contract termination costs and certain other exit costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Restructuring expenses $ 191 -56% -56% $ 431 Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2022 primarily related to our 2022 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2021 primarily related to our 2019 Restructuring Plan, which is substantially complete. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2022 Restructuring Plan and the 2019 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans. The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2022 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing, selling and delivering our cloud-based offerings. Certain of the cost savings realized pursuant to our 2022 Restructuring Plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that better address the development, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud‑based offerings including investments in the development and delivery of our second‑generation cloud infrastructure. Interest Expense: Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Interest expense $ 2,755 10% 10% $ 2,496 Interest expense increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher average borrowings during fiscal 2022 that resulted from our issuance of $15.0 billion of senior notes in March 2021 partially offset by lower interest expense that resulted from $8.3 billion of scheduled repayments made during fiscal 2022. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Non-Operating (Expenses) Income, net: Non-operating (expenses) income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan), net gains and losses related to equity investments including losses attributable to equity method investments and net other income and expenses, including net unrealized gains and losses from our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, and non-service net periodic pension income and losses. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 Interest income $ 94 -7% -5% $ 101 Foreign currency losses, net (199 ) 79% 79% (112 ) Noncontrolling interests in income (184 ) 2% 2% (180 ) (Losses) gains in equity investments, net (147 ) * * 262 Other (losses) gains, net (86 ) * * 211 Total non-operating (expenses) income, net $ (522 ) * * $ 282 * Not meaningful In constant currency, we incurred non-operating expenses, net in fiscal 2022 in comparison to non-operating income, net that we recorded in fiscal 2021. Non-operating expenses, net increased during fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher net foreign currency losses; higher net losses from equity investments, primarily due to an unrealized gain of $299 million recorded in fiscal 2021 for certain non-marketable equity securities with no such corresponding gain recorded in fiscal 2022; higher losses in fiscal 2022 associated with equity investments for which we follow the equity method of accounting; and higher other expense, net, which was primarily attributable to higher unrealized investment losses associated with certain marketable equity securities that we held for employee benefit plans, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period. (Provision for) Benefit from Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others. Year Ended May 31, Percent Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 Actual Constant 2021 (Provision for) benefit from income taxes $ (932 ) * * $ 747 Effective tax expense (benefit) rate 12.2% (5.7%) * Not meaningful Provision for income taxes increased during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to the absence of a favorable impact of $2.3 billion net tax benefit arising from an increase in a net deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights in fiscal 2021. This unfavorable variance was partially offset by lower income taxes of $824 million associated with lower pre-tax income in fiscal 2022 that was primarily attributable to certain litigation related charges as further described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and, to a much lesser extent, a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings partially offset by a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and other events. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Working capital $ 12,122 -61% $ 31,403 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 21,902 -53% $ 46,554 Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2022 in comparison to May 31, 2021 was primarily due to $16.2 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, $4.7 billion of cash paid for certain litigation related charges that we generally do not expect to recur, $3.8 billion of long-term senior notes that were reclassified to current liabilities, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income, net cash proceeds of $318 million associated with the sale of certain operating assets, and cash proceeds from stock option exercises, all of which occurred during fiscal 2022. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain other securities. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2022 in comparison to May 31, 2021 was primarily due to $16.2 billion of settled repurchases of our common stock, $8.3 billion of debt repayments, $4.7 billion of cash paid for certain litigation related charges that we generally do not expect to recur, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. These cash outflows during fiscal 2022 were partially offset by certain cash inflows generated by our normal business operations, from the sales of certain operating assets, and from stock option exercises during fiscal 2022. Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,539 -40% $ 15,887 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities $ 11,220 * $ (13,098 ) Net cash used for financing activities $ (29,126 ) 181% $ (10,378 ) * Not meaningful Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to lower net income that was primarily the result of cash payments made in connection with certain litigation related charges that we generally do not expect to recur and certain other cash unfavorable working capital changes, net, in each case during fiscal 2022 in comparison to fiscal 2021. Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth. Net cash provided by investing activities was $11.2 billion during fiscal 2022 in comparison to net cash used for investing activities of $13.1 billion during fiscal 2021. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in the cash used for the purchases of marketable securities and 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements other investments, partially offset by a decrease in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and other investments and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures, in each case during fiscal 2022 in comparison to fiscal 2021. Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2022 increased compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an issuance of $15.0 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2021 with no corresponding issuance of senior notes in fiscal 2022, higher debt repayments, higher net cash used for our employee stock program, and higher payments of dividends, partially offset by lower stock repurchases, in each case during fiscal 2022 in comparison to fiscal 2021. Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows: Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,539 -40% $ 15,887 Capital expenditures (4,511 ) 111% (2,135 ) Free cash flow $ 5,028 -63% $ 13,752 Net income $ 6,717 $ 13,746 Free cash flow as percent of net income 75% 100% Recent Financing Activities: Credit Agreements and Related Borrowings: In March 2022, we entered into a $6.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $15.7 billion, 364-day delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the Bridge Credit Agreement). In June 2022, in connection with the acquisition of Cerner, we borrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement. Additional information is included in Notes 7 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2022, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.28 per share that totaled $3.5 billion. In June 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 26, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 12, 2022. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On December 9, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2022, approximately $9.4 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 185.8 million shares for $16.2 billion, 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion, and 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations: Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2022 consisted of: • principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments; • our acquisition of Cerner, which closed on June 8, 2022 and for which we borrowed $15.7 billion on the same day pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement; • routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; • operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; and • other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. In addition, as of May 31, 2022, we had $8.9 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2023. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. Notes 2, 7, 13 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, and the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Bridge Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. Stock-Based Awards Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2019 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.3% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2022, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2022, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 8.4%. During fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2022 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Stock-based awards activity from June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2022 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): Stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2019 321 Stock-based awards granted and assumed 169 Stock-based awards vested and issued and, if applicable, exercised (211 ) Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net (54 ) Stock-based awards outstanding at May 31, 2022 225 Weighted-average annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations 39 Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases (292 ) Shares outstanding at May 31, 2022 2,665 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2022 2,952 Stock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2022 8.4% Total in the money stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2022) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2022 8.4% Weighted-average annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2022 1.3% Weighted-average annualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2022 -8.6% Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Equity Price Risk Marketable and Non-Marketable Equity Investments Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities investments totaled $1.1 billion and $946 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our marketable equity securities investments in publicly traded companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. Our non-marketable equity securities investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment. Our non-marketable equity securities investments accounted for under the equity method, primarily in a related party entity, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these equity method investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover. The timing and amounts of changes in fair value, if any, of our marketable and non-marketable equity investments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies in which we invest. For additional disclosure regarding the impact to our quarterly results of operations from investment volatility, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Currency Risk Foreign Currency Translation Risk As described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. In particular, the strengthening of 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, total revenues and total expenses that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies. Our principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Saudi Arabian Riyal, Indian Rupee and British Pound. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions. We have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for trading purposes. We realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, and we also incur costs to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, substantially all of which are included in non-operating expenses or income, net in our consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts. Sensitivity Analysis The following table sets forth the hypothetical potential losses that we consider to be the most material to the reported fair values and/or future earnings of our interest rate, equity price and foreign currency influenced holdings, prior to any income tax effects, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates as of or for the reporting periods below: Year Ended May 31, (in millions) Hypothetical Change Impact 2022 2021 Equity price risk: Marketable and non-marketable equity investments 25% decrease in market price and fair values Earnings $ (277 ) $ (236 ) Foreign currency risk: Total revenues 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates Earnings $ (2,107 ) $ (2,061 ) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates Fair values $ (421 ) $ (650 )",2023-12-30 16:56:27.139962
