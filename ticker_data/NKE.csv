320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2013,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet websites, which we refer to as our “Direct to Consumer” operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and service businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online.In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas:•Expanding gross margin by:- Making our supply chain a competitive advantage;- Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; and- Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer price-to-value proposition.•Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs;•Improving working capital efficiency; and•Deploying capital effectively.Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be:•High single-digit revenue growth,•Mid-teens earnings per share growth,•Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and•Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses.Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, revenues and earnings per share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 9% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 18% to 24% and we expanded gross margins by approximately 260 basis points.On November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2013 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings, and cash returns to shareholders, while investing for long-term growth. Despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2013. Our revenues grew 8% to $25.3 billion, net income from continuing operations increased 9% to $2.5 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.69, an 11% increase from fiscal 2012.Earnings before interest and income taxes for continuing operations increased 8% for fiscal 2013, driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across most NIKE Brand geographies, key categories and product types. This growth was primarily fueled by:•Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Lunar, Shox, FREE, Flywire, Dri-F.I.T, FlyKnit, NIKE +, and NIKE Fuel; •Deep brand connections to consumers through a category lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high profile athletes and teams (such as the NFL, FC Barcelona, Michael Jordan), high impact marketing around global sporting events (such as the Olympics, European Football Championships and NBA Finals) and digital marketing; and•Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE owned and retail partner stores. Revenues also improved for each of our Other Businesses (Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley). Our gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs, primarily labor cost inflation, and foreign currency headwinds.For fiscal 2013, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate. In addition, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding, as a result of share repurchases during fiscal 2013. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which would allow us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. During the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of certain assets of the Umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of $107 million, net of tax. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of Cole Haan and recorded a gain on sale of $231 million, net of tax. As of May 31, 2013 the Company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses. Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company's continuing operations; refer to our “Discontinued Operations"" section for additional information regarding our discontinued operations.While we expect to face continued macroeconomic uncertainties in the global economy, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term, by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.17Table of ContentsResults of Operations Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company’s continuing operations.(Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % ChangeRevenues $25,313 $23,331 8% $20,117 16%Cost of sales 14,279 13,183 8% 10,915 21%Gross profit 11,034 10,148 9% 9,202 10%Gross margin % 43.6% 43.5% 45.7% Demand creation expense 2,745 2,607 5% 2,344 11%Operating overhead expense 5,035 4,458 13% 4,017 11%Total selling and administrative expense 7,780 7,065 10% 6,361 11%% of Revenues 30.7% 30.3% 31.6% Interest (income) expense, net (3) 4 — 4 —Other (income) expense, net (15) 54 — (25) —Income before income taxes 3,272 3,025 8% 2,862 6%Income tax expense 808 756 7% 690 10%Effective tax rate 24.7% 25.0% 24.1% Net income from continuing operations 2,464 2,269 9% 2,172 4%Net income (loss) from discontinued operations 21 (46) — (39) —Net income $2,485 $2,223 12% $2,133 4%Diluted earnings per share - Continuing Operations $2.69 $2.42 11% $2.24 8%Diluted earnings per share - Discontinued Operations $0.02 $(0.05) — $(0.04) —18Table of ContentsConsolidated Operating ResultsRevenues(Dollars in millions)Fiscal 2013Fiscal 2012FY13 vs. FY12 % ChangeFY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding CurrencyChanges(2)Fiscal 2011FY12 vs. FY11 % ChangeFY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)NIKE, Inc.

NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers.(5)Others include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level.19Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis, revenues from our NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2013, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. Every NIKE Brand geography except Greater China delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2013. North America contributed 7 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Emerging Markets contributed 2 percentage points and Western and Central and Eastern Europe each contributed 1 percentage point. Greater China's results reduced NIKE, Inc. revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues for our Other Businesses contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth.Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 20% during fiscal 2013. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including Running models with NIKE FREE and Lunar technologies, NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles, and performance Football (soccer) products. In fiscal 2013, unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4%, driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products.For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2013 was driven by our Men's Training category (which includes the NFL licensed business), in addition to strong demand for Running and Basketball products. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 3%, reflecting a favorable mix of higher priced products, such as performance Running, Basketball, and NFL licensed apparel, and to a lesser extent, higher selling prices.While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand Direct to Consumer revenues. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2013, Direct to Consumer revenues represented approximately 19% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 17% in fiscal 2012. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 24% for fiscal 2013, as comparable store sales grew 14% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year.Revenues for our Other Businesses are comprised of results from Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased 9% in fiscal 2013, reflecting growth across all businesses.Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 On a currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations grew 15% for fiscal 2012, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 15%, as every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012. North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase, while the Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. Revenues for our Other Businesses grew 12% during fiscal 2012, contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth.Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15% and 13%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 16% during fiscal 2012. Continuing to fuel the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and FREE technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to double-digit percentage growth in unit sales along with a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair, primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, notably Running, Sportswear and Basketball. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by mid-single-digit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices. The increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases, partially offset by a higher mix of close-out sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories.For fiscal 2012, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 17% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2011. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 21% for fiscal 2012, as comparable store sales grew 13% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business.Revenues for our Other Businesses consisted of results from our affiliate brands; Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 12% in fiscal 2012, reflecting growth across all businesses except Hurley, which was down slightly for the fiscal year.Futures OrdersFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2013 were 8% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders also increased 8%, as unit orders contributed approximately 5 percentage points of growth and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth.20Table of ContentsBy geography, futures orders growth was as follows: Reported FuturesOrders Growth Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes(1)North America 12 % 12%Western Europe 2 % 0%Central & Eastern Europe 14 % 12%Greater China 3 % 0%Japan -17 % 6%Emerging Markets 12 % 12%Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders 8 % 8%(1)Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Gross Margin(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Gross Profit $11,034 $10,148 9% $9,202 10% Gross Margin % 43.6% 43.5% 10 bps 45.7% (220) bps Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013, our consolidated gross margin was 10 basis points higher than fiscal 2012, primarily driven by higher net average selling prices (approximately 160 basis points) that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix. The positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs (approximately 110 basis points), primarily due to higher factory labor costs, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (approximately 40 basis points).In addition, we have seen significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business. While growth in these lower gross margin segments delivers incremental revenue and profits, it has a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, across most businesses. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges, discounts on close-out sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points. Partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases, lower air freight costs, the growth of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. Selling and Administrative Expense(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Demand creation expense(1) $2,745 $2,607 5% $2,344 11% Operating overhead expense 5,035 4,458 13% 4,017 11% Selling and administrative expense $7,780 $7,065 10% $6,361 11% % of Revenues 30.7% 30.3% 40 bps 31.6% (130) bps (1)Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Demand creation expense increased 5% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL launch, as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, demand creation expense increased 8%.21Table of ContentsCompared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 13%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs, and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the growth in operating overhead expense was 15%.Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Overall, selling and administrative expense grew at a slower rate than revenues for fiscal 2012.Demand creation expense increased 11% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL launch, as well as an increased level of brand event spending in advance of the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point.Compared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 11%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of operating overhead expense by 1 percentage point. Other (Income) Expense, net(In millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011Other (income) expense, net $(15) $54 $(25)Other (income) expense, net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013, other (income), net increased $69 million compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses in the current year as well as the recognition of a $24 million restructuring charge for NIKE Brand's Western Europe operations in the prior year. These positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from non-operating items.We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes of $56 million for fiscal 2013.Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, other expense, net increased $79 million compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a $77 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year. These impacts, together with a $24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of NIKE Brand's Western Europe operations, were partially offset by certain net gains related to non-operating items.We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense, net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012. Income Taxes Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % ChangeEffective tax rate 24.7% 25.0% (30) bps 24.1% 90 bps Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 The 30 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by the U.S. legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 90 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the United States as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings.Discontinued OperationsThe Company continually evaluates its existing portfolio of businesses to ensure resources are invested in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand and represent the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, the Company announced its intention to divest of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing it to focus its resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. 22Table of ContentsOn February 1, 2013, the Company completed the sale of Cole Haan to Apax Partners for an agreed upon purchase price of $570 million and received at closing $561 million, net of $9 million of purchase price adjustments. The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of $231 million, net of $137 million in tax expense; this gain is included in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. Beginning November 30, 2012, we classified the Cole Haan disposal group as held-for-sale and presented the results of Cole Haan’s operations in the net income (loss) from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income. From this date until the sale, the assets and liabilities of Cole Haan were recorded as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets of NIKE, Inc. Previously, these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as “Other Businesses.”Under the sale agreement, we agreed to provide certain transition services to Cole Haan for an expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale. We will also license NIKE proprietary Air and Lunar technologies to Cole Haan for a transition period. The continuing cash flows related to these items are not expected to be significant to Cole Haan and we will have no significant continuing involvement with Cole Haan beyond the transition services. Additionally, preexisting guarantees of certain Cole Haan lease payments remain in place after the sale; the maximum exposure under the guarantees is $44 million at May 31, 2013. The fair value of these guarantees is not material.On November 30, 2012, we completed the sale of certain assets of Umbro to Iconix Brand Group (“Iconix”) for $225 million. The results of Umbro’s operations and Umbro’s financial position are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income and balance sheets, respectively. Previously, these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as “Other Businesses.” Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria, we recorded a loss of $107 million, net of tax, on the sale of Umbro. The loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less the Umbro assets of $248 million, including intangibles, goodwill, and fixed assets, other miscellaneous charges of $22 million, and the release of the associated cumulative translation adjustment of $129 million, offset by a $67 million tax benefit on the loss.Under the sale agreement, we provided transition services to Iconix while certain markets were transitioned to Iconix-designated licensees. These transition services are substantially complete and we have wound down the remaining operations of Umbro. For the year ended May 31, 2013, net income (loss) from discontinued operations included, for both businesses, the net gain or loss on sale, net operating losses, tax expenses, and approximately $20 million in wind down costs.Operating SegmentsThe Company’s reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program.Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2013 presentation.The breakdown of revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012(1) FY13 vs. FY12 % Change FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2) Fiscal 2011(1) FY12 vs. FY11 % Change FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)North America $10,387 $8,839 18 % 18 % $7,579 17% 17%Western Europe 4,128 4,144 0 % 5 % 3,868 7% 4%Central & Eastern Europe 1,287 1,200 7 % 12 % 1,040 15% 17%Greater China 2,453 2,539 -3 % -5 % 2,060 23% 18%Japan 791 835 -5 % 1 % 773 8% 1%Emerging Markets 3,718 3,411 9 % 16 % 2,737 25% 26%Global Brand Divisions 117 111 5 % 8 % 96 16% 13%Total NIKE Brand Revenues 22,881 21,079 9 % 11 % 18,153 16% 15%Other Businesses 2,500 2,298 9 % 9 % 2,041 13% 12%Corporate(3) (68) (46) — — (77) — —TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories drove the revenue growth in fiscal 2013. North America's Direct to Consumer revenue growth for fiscal 2013 was fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales as well as the addition of new stores and rapid growth in online sales.North America footwear revenue growth was driven by higher demand in all seven key categories, most notably Basketball, Running, and Sportswear. Both unit sales and average selling price per pair increased 7% in fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven approximately equally by price increases and a favorable mix of higher priced products.Apparel revenue growth in North America was driven by higher demand in our Men's Training category, reflecting the addition of the NFL licensed business, as well as Basketball, Women's Training, and Running. Unit sales increased 10% while average selling price per unit increased 12%, largely driven by a favorable mix of higher priced products. 24Table of ContentsNorth America EBIT increased faster than revenue due to gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2013, reflecting the favorable impact of selling price increases, partially offset by higher product costs, an unfavorable mix of lower margin products and royalties for the NFL business. Selling and administrative expenses increased versus fiscal 2012, though at a rate slower than revenue; the growth was largely driven by higher demand creation expense for the Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as well as key product initiatives, including the NFL launch, and higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business.Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenues for North America increased 17% for fiscal 2012, driven by growth in both wholesale and Direct to Consumer revenues. Our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers, driving demand for NIKE Brand products across all seven key categories. North America’s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19% for fiscal 2012, driven by 15% growth in comparable store sales.For fiscal 2012, footwear revenue in North America increased 15%, driven by an increase in both unit sales and average selling prices. Unit sales rose at a double-digit rate while average selling price per pair grew at a mid-single-digit rate, reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Basketball, Women’s Training and Sportswear.Compared to the prior year, apparel revenue for North America increased 18%, primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in unit sales. The increase in average selling price per unit was reflective of product price increases and a greater mix of higher price point products. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, including Men’s Training, Running and Basketball.For fiscal 2012, EBIT for North America increased 17% as revenue growth and improved selling and administrative expense leverage more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points during fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product input costs and lower gross margins on close-out sales, which more than offset the favorable impact of selling price increases, lower air freight costs and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 70 basis points for fiscal 2012, as both demand creation and operating overhead expense grew at a slower rate than revenues.Western Europe(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % Change FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $2,646 $2,526 5 % 10 % $2,345 8 % 5%Apparel 1,261 1,377 -8 % -4 % 1,303 6 % 2%Equipment 221 241 -8 % -3 % 220 10 % 5%TOTAL REVENUES $4,128 $4,144 0 % 5 % $3,868 7 % 4%Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $3,416 $3,556 -4 % 1 % $3,385 5 % 2%Sales Direct to Consumer 712 588 21 % 27 % 483 22 % 18%TOTAL REVENUES $4,128 $4,144 0 % 5 % $3,868 7 % 4%EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $640 $597 7 % $730 -18 % Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis, most territories in Western Europe reported revenue growth for fiscal 2013, which more than offset revenue declines of 17% and 18% in Italy and Iberia, respectively, reflecting poor economic conditions in Southern Europe. Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland) territories, the largest markets in Western Europe, increased 8% and 12%, respectively. The growth in Direct to Consumer revenues reflected 17% growth in comparable store sales, the addition of 19 net new factory stores and strong growth in online sales. On a category basis, Western Europe's revenue growth was largely driven by growth in our Running and Basketball categories. Constant currency footwear revenue growth in Western Europe was primarily driven by growth in Running, Sportswear, and Basketball. Unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 3%, the latter primarily the result of price increases. The constant currency decrease in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to a decline in Sportswear, partially offset by growth in Running, Men's Training, and Basketball. Unit sales in fiscal 2013 decreased 1% while average selling price per unit decreased 3%, as higher discounts on close-out sales more than offset selling price increases. The EBIT growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by a 200 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates; higher net average selling prices were mostly offset by higher product costs. The increase in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as higher sports marketing expense. Additionally, operating overhead costs increased to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business. Fiscal 2013 EBIT growth for Western Europe was also increased by a $24 million, one-time restructuring charge that was recorded in other (income) expense, net, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. 25Table of ContentsFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 On a currency neutral basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 4% for fiscal 2012, as most territories reported revenue growth, which more than offset revenue declines in the U.K. & Ireland and Italy. Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, declined 3% for the fiscal 2012 period. Western Europe’s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 18% for fiscal 2012, including 8% growth in comparable store sales.Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 5% for fiscal 2012, primarily driven by a low-single-digit percentage growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair, primarily reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in Running, Basketball and Football (Soccer), which more than offset a decline in Action Sports.Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2% for fiscal 2012. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a mid-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, reflective of higher product prices. Partially offsetting the increase in average selling price per unit was a mid-single-digit percentage decline in unit sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a decline in Sportswear.On a reported basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 7% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 18%, primarily driven by a 350 basis point decline in gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The decline in gross margin was driven by higher product input costs and the negative impact from changes in standard currency rates, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Also reflected in Western Europe’s fiscal 2012 results was a $24 million charge relating to the restructuring of its operations.

Revenue growth in Central & Eastern Europe was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear.Constant currency footwear revenue growth in fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by growth in Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 6% while average selling price per pair increased 5%, primarily driven by price increases. Constant currency apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in nearly all categories, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Running. Unit sales increased 16%, while average selling price per unit decreased 2%, as an unfavorable mix of lower priced products more than off-set higher selling prices. EBIT for Central & Eastern Europe grew faster than revenue primarily due to gross margin improvement and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 30 basis points, largely driven by price increases and the favorable impact of our higher margin Direct to Consumer business, more than offsetting higher product costs and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Central & Eastern Europe increased 17% for fiscal 2012, driven by growth across most territories, including double-digit growth in Russia and Turkey, which more than offset lower revenues in Greece.Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central & Eastern Europe’s footwear revenue grew 13%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair. The increase in average selling price per pair was reflective of product price increases which more than offset the negative impact of higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, most notably Running, Sportswear and Football (Soccer).Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central & Eastern Europe’s apparel revenues grew 24%, mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales, offset by a slight decrease in average price per unit, mainly due to less favorable product mix and higher discounts on in-line sales, which more than offset the impact from product price increases. The overall increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in Football (Soccer), Sportswear and Running.26Table of ContentsOn a reported basis, revenues for Central & Eastern Europe increased 15% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 4%, primarily driven by a 420 basis point decline in gross margin. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to higher product input costs as well as higher discounts on in-line and close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact from product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat compared to the prior period.Greater China(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % Change FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $1,493 $1,518 -2 % -3 % $1,164 30% 25%Apparel 829 896 -7 % -9 % 789 14% 9%Equipment 131 125 5 % 3 % 107 17% 12%TOTAL REVENUES $2,453 $2,539 -3 % -5 % $2,060 23% 18%EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $809 $911 -11 % $777 17% Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis, Greater China revenue decreased in fiscal 2013, driven by lower futures orders as well as increased discounts, product returns and proactive cancellation of orders to manage inventory levels at retail. These downsides were partially offset by 33% growth in our Direct to Consumer business driven by comparable store sales growth of 13% and the addition of 29 net new factory stores. Fiscal 2013 revenues for most key categories were lower than in fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2013, constant currency footwear revenue growth for Greater China declined, driven by lower sales across most key categories, most notably Sportswear and Men's and Women's Training, and increased reserves for product discounts and returns. Unit sales decreased 1%, while average selling price per pair decreased 2%, reflecting a higher mix of close-out sales and higher discounts. The decrease in constant currency apparel revenue for fiscal 2013 was driven by lower revenues in Sportswear and Men's and Women's Training, partially offset by higher revenues in Basketball. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 were 3% lower than the prior year while average selling price per unit was down 6%, reflecting a higher mix of close-out sales and higher discounts. Fiscal 2013 EBIT for Greater China decreased at a faster rate than revenue, driven by lower gross margin and selling and administrative expense deleverage. Fiscal 2013 gross margin decreased 50 basis points due to a lower average selling price per unit driven by higher discounts and close-out mix partially offset by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues, driven primarily by the increased investment in our Direct to Consumer business and the decrease in revenues.Our results in Greater China have been adversely impacted by sluggish macroeconomic growth and slow product sell-through at retail, leading to high levels of inventory in the marketplace. Our strategy to return to sustained, profitable growth in Greater China focuses on extending our brand leadership position with consumers; expanding the offering of product styles and fits designed for the Chinese consumer; and working with our retail partners to create more differentiated, productive, and profitable retail stores.Despite the challenges we have seen in China, there are indications that our strategies are taking hold in the marketplace. Comparable store sales are growing in our NIKE-owned Direct to Consumer doors and our wholesale customers are reporting comparable store growth and declining inventory levels. While we are making progress, we will continue to work with our retailers to optimize inventory, accelerate sell-through, and improve retail productivity. While China futures orders for the next six months are in line with last year, we expect revenues for the first half of the fiscal year will be below last year as we continue to manage the amount of product we ship into the market. We believe our revenue in China will stabilize around prior year levels in the second half of this fiscal year. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2012, driven by continued expansion in the number of both NIKE mono-branded stores owned by our wholesale customers and NIKE owned stores, as well as higher comparable store sales.Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater China’s footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a mid-single-digit growth in average unit price per pair, reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, led by Running and Sportswear.Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater China’s apparel revenues for fiscal 2012 was mainly driven by a high-single-digit growth in the average selling price per unit and a low-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out products to accelerate the sales of slower moving apparel inventories.On a reported basis, revenues for Greater China increased 23% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 17%, as revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in gross margin and an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. Gross margin decreased 150 basis points for fiscal 2012, primarily attributable to higher product input costs and discounts on close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, driven by an increase in operating overhead expense.27Table of ContentsJapan(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % Change FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $429 $439 -2 % 5 % $397 11% 3 %Apparel 301 325 -7 % -1 % 305 7% -1 %Equipment 61 71 -14 % -9 % 71 0% -5 %TOTAL REVENUES $791 $835 -5 % 1 % $773 8% 1 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $133 $136 -2 % $114 19% Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the revenue increase for Japan was driven by higher revenues in Running, Football (Soccer) and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Sportswear and Men's and Women's Training. Fiscal 2013 EBIT for Japan decreased as a result of lower revenues, partially offset by gross margin improvement and lower selling and administrative expense. The decrease in selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2013 was attributable to lower operating overhead and demand creation spending.Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 During fiscal 2012, the macroeconomic environment in Japan remained uncertain as the market continued to recover from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in March 2011. On a currency neutral basis, footwear revenue in Japan increased 3% for fiscal 2012, as growth in Running and Football (Soccer) more than offset a decline in Sportswear.Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue decreased 1% for fiscal 2012, as the decline in Sportswear more than offset the growth in Running and Football (Soccer).On a reported basis, EBIT for Japan grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of improved gross margin and leverage of selling and administrative expenses. The increase in Japan’s gross margin was mainly driven by the favorable impact from the year-over-year change in standard currency rates, a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense as well as a lower mix of close-out sales. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher product input costs.

Unit sales increased approximately 9% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by selling price increases. Fiscal 2013 constant currency apparel revenue was driven by growth in every key category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, Sportswear, and Men's Training. Unit sales increased approximately 10% and average selling price per unit increased 9%, largely attributable to price increases.Fiscal 2013 Emerging Markets EBIT grew faster than revenue primarily driven by gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue. Gross margin increased 260 basis points due largely to the favorable impact of price increases, the anniversary of a one-time custom duty charge in fiscal 2012, and favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher product costs. As a percent of revenue, selling and administrative expense was higher due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our Direct to Consumer business and overall growth of the business.28Table of ContentsFiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the Emerging Markets increased 26% for fiscal 2012 as all territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth, led by Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea.For fiscal 2012, revenue growth for both footwear and apparel in the Emerging Markets was driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and mid-single-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit, primarily reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in Emerging Markets’ footwear and apparel sales was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, led by Running and Sportswear.The increase in Emerging Markets’ EBIT for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, which more than offset a lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 150 basis points for the fiscal year, primarily due to higher product input costs, customs duty charges and inventory obsolescence expense. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in standard currency exchange rates and product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 140 basis points, as both demand creation expense and operating overhead grew at a slower rate than revenues.Global Brand Divisions(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % Change FY12 vs. FY11 % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues $117 $111 5% 8% $96 16% 13%(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes (1,396) (1,200) 16% (971) 24% Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation, operating overhead, and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.

The revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased sales in North America and China, as well as increased revenues in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to direct distribution in the second half of fiscal 2011. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE Golf increased 9% for fiscal 2012, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our apparel business, partially offset by a single-digit percentage decline in our club business.On a reported basis, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 13% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 9%, as earnings growth at Converse was partially off-set by losses at Hurley. Higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues negatively affected profitability and lower gross margins contributed to the decline in Hurley's earnings.Corporate(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs. FY12 % Change Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11 % ChangeRevenues $(68) $(46) — $(77) —(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes (1,177) (917) 28% (805) 14%Corporate revenues primarily consist of certain intercompany revenue eliminations and foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses; certain intercompany eliminations and other items.In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results included in gross margin are gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses and related foreign currency hedge results. All other foreign currency related results, including conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and certain foreign currency derivative instruments, are included in other (income) expense, net.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $260 million primarily due to the following:•A $165 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin.•A $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses, reported as a component of consolidated other (income) expense, net. •A $143 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business and performance-based compensation. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes grew $112 million, mainly due to an increase of $49 million in performance-based compensation and a year-over-year net increase of $73 million from foreign currency impacts. These foreign currency impacts were driven by a year-over-year increase in foreign currency net losses, arising from certain Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign currency hedges and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various non-functional currencies, net of related undesignated forward instruments, as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. Dollar year-over-year. The above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses.Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging PracticesOverviewAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (""NTC"") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes 30Table of Contentson the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Transactional exposuresWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.Managing transactional exposuresTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below..Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 – Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end.Translational exposuresMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders’ equity. In the translation of our consolidated statements of income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $(605) million and $268 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate 31Table of Contentsfluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $(104) million and $74 million for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Managing translational exposuresTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end.We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $56 million on our income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2013 and had an insignificant impact for the year ended May 31, 2012.Net investments in foreign subsidiariesWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2013 and 2012. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $22 million for the year ended May 31, 2012.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow ActivityCash provided by operations was $3.0 billion for fiscal 2013 compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2012. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2013 was net income of $2.5 billion. Our fiscal 2013 change in working capital was a net cash outflow of $42 million, which is exclusive of working capital amounts sold as part of the divestitures of Umbro and Cole Haan, as compared to a net cash outflow of $799 million for fiscal 2012. Our investments in working capital decreased due to slowing growth in inventory and reductions in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2013, inventory for continuing operations increased 7% compared to a 23% increase for fiscal 2012; the slowing growth was driven by our continued focus on increasing inventory productivity. The reduction in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the collection of receivables related to discontinued operations.Cash used by investing activities was $1,067 million during fiscal 2013, compared to a $514 million source of cash for fiscal 2012. A major driver of the change was the swing from net sales/maturities of short-term investments in fiscal 2012 to net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2013, reflective of the additional purchases of short-term investments made with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in April 2013. In fiscal 2012, there were $1,124 million of net sales/maturities of short-term investments (net of purchases), while in fiscal 2013 we made $1,203 million in net purchases of short-term investments (net of sales/maturities). This impact was partially offset by $786 million in proceeds from the sale of Umbro and Cole Haan in fiscal 2013.Cash used by financing activities was $1,040 million for fiscal 2013 compared to $2,118 million for fiscal 2012. The decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to $986 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in April 2013. Also contributing to the decrease were lower payments of long-term debt and notes payable and lower repurchases of common stock, which were partially offset by a reduction in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.In fiscal 2013, we purchased 33.5 million shares of NIKE’s class B common stock for $1.7 billion, an average price of $49.50. During the year, we completed the four-year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08. Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2013, we had repurchased 15.3 million shares at a cost of $789 million under this current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.Capital ResourcesOn April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the ""Shelf"") with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. The Shelf expires on April 23, 2017. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. We will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not 32Table of Contentslimited to, discharging or refinancing debt, working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, as yet unplanned acquisitions of assets or businesses and investments in subsidiaries.On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures November 1, 2016, with a one-year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date, provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1, 2018. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2013, we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility.We currently have long-term debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2013, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2013, we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of $505 million. As of May 31, 2013, there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2014 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.As of May 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $6.0 billion, of which $3.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2013 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio is 98 days.Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the U.S., we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the U.S. through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt, we would incur additional interest expense.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations.Contractual ObligationsOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2013 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows:Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,(In millions) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter TotalOperating Leases $403 $340 $304 $272 $225 $816 $2,360Capital Leases 23 28 21 9 — — 81Long-term Debt 98 46 145 79 56 1,525 1,949Endorsement Contracts(1) 909 790 586 450 309 559 3,603Product Purchase Obligations(2) 3,273 — — — — — 3,273Other(3) 304 89 52 82 4 18 549TOTAL $5,010 $1,293 $1,108 $892 $594 $2,918 $11,815(1)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number 33Table of Contentsof sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(2)We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2013.(3)Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2013.The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $447 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2013. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur.We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2013. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.(In millions)Outstanding as of May 31, 2013Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand$121Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port55As of May 31, 2013, letters of credit of $149 million were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsIn July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2013, and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.In September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. The adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders’ equity. Companies are now required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This requirement was effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amended the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Further, this guidance required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This requirement will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.Critical Accounting PoliciesOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the 34Table of Contentssix-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters.Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.Revenue RecognitionWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale.In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made.Inventory ReservesWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement ContractsA significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period.Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period.Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived AssetsProperty, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value.We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant 35Table of Contentsadverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Fair Value MeasurementsFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor.Hedge Accounting for DerivativesWe use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur.We have used and may, in the future, use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net 36Table of Contentsinvestments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur.Stock-based CompensationWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.TaxesWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination.On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.Other ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.37Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, and may in the future, also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Generally, hedged transactions are expected to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. See section “Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed rate debt.Market Risk MeasurementWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $34 million and $21 million at May 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with a longer average duration on our outstanding trades at May 31, 2013. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $49 million and $87 million during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively.The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates at May 31, 2013.38Table of Contents Expected Maturity DateYear Ending May 31,(Dollars in millions) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Total Fair ValueForeign Exchange Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $7 $7 $7 $7 $7 $14 $49 $52Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% Interest Rate Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $7 $7 $7 $7 $7 $14 $49 $52Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% U.S. Dollar Functional Currency Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate swapped to Floating rate Principal payments $— $— $100 $— $— $— $100 $110Average interest rate 0.0% 0.0% 0.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.4% Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $51 $1 $1 $38 $18 $1,000 $1,109 $1,057Average interest rate 4.7% 6.4% 6.4% 6.2% 6.8% 2.9% 3.2% The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2014,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNIKE designs, develops, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, as well as through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites (which we refer to as our “Direct to Consumer” or ""DTC"" operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees, and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online.In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas:•Expanding gross margin by:- Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer price-to-value proposition;- Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design, and innovation; and- Making our supply chain a competitive advantage.•Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs;•Improving working capital efficiency; and•Deploying capital effectively.Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be:•High single-digit revenue growth,•Mid-teens earnings per share growth,•Consistent return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and•Steady results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses.Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of these financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 9% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 22% to 25% and we expanded gross margins by approximately 190 basis points.On November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2014 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings, and cash returns to shareholders, while investing for long-term growth. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2014. Our revenues grew 10% to $27.8 billion, net income from continuing operations increased 10% to $2.7 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per common share of $2.97, an 11% increase from fiscal 2013.Earnings before interest and income taxes (""EBIT"") from continuing operations increased 10% for fiscal 2014, driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across nearly all NIKE Brand geographies, key categories, and product types. This growth was primarily fueled by:•Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE AIR, Lunar, Shox, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, FlyKnit, NIKE+, and NIKE Fuel; •Deep brand connections to consumers through a category lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes and teams, high-impact marketing around global sporting events (such as the World Cup, Olympics, and NFL Super Bowl) and digital marketing; and•Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. We also delivered strong results for Converse, with revenue and EBIT growth of 16% and 17%, respectively.Our gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices and contribution from our higher margin DTC business, partially offset by higher product input costs, due primarily to labor cost inflation in our product costs, and foreign currency headwinds.For fiscal 2014, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate. In addition, diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 1% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases. During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed the sale of certain assets of the Umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of $107 million, net of tax. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed the sale of Cole Haan and recorded a gain on sale of $231 million, net of tax. As of May 31, 2013, the Company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses. Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company's continuing operations; refer to our “Discontinued Operations"" section for additional information regarding our discontinued operations.While macroeconomic uncertainties in the global economy are likely to persist, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.19Table of ContentsResults of Operations Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company’s continuing operations.(Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013(1) % Change Fiscal 2012(1) % ChangeRevenues $27,799 $25,313 10% $23,331 8%Cost of sales 15,353 14,279 8% 13,183 8%Gross profit 12,446 11,034 13% 10,148 9%Gross margin % 44.8% 43.6% 43.5% Demand creation expense 3,031 2,745 10% 2,607 5%Operating overhead expense 5,735 5,051 14% 4,472 13%Total selling and administrative expense 8,766 7,796 12% 7,079 10%% of Revenues 31.5% 30.8% 30.3% Interest expense (income), net 33 (3) — 4 —Other expense (income), net 103 (15) — 54 —Income before income taxes 3,544 3,256 9% 3,011 8%Income tax expense 851 805 6% 754 7%Effective tax rate 24.0% 24.7% 25.0% Net income from continuing operations 2,693 2,451 10% 2,257 9%Net income (loss) from discontinued operations — 21 — (46) —Net income $2,693 $2,472 9% $2,211 12%Diluted earnings per share - continuing operations $2.97 $2.68 11% $2.40 12%Diluted earnings per share - discontinued operations $— $0.02 — $(0.05) —(1)Prior year amounts have been revised to correctly expense internally developed patent and trademark costs as incurred.

Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2014. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe and Emerging Markets each contributed 2 percentage points and Central & Eastern Europe and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. On a currency neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 4% during fiscal 2014. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2014 was mainly due to growth in our Basketball, Sportswear, Running, and Football (Soccer) categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles; Running models with NIKE Free, Air Max, Lunar, and FlyKnit technologies; and performance Football (Soccer) products. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 5%, driven nearly equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably our Football (Soccer), Running, and Women's Training categories. In fiscal 2014, unit sales of apparel increased approximately 6% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 4%, driven by price increases, and to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher priced products.While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE-owned websites. For fiscal 2014, DTC revenues represented approximately 20% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 18% in fiscal 2013. On a currency neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 22% for fiscal 2014, as comparable store sales grew 10% and we continued to open new stores and expand our e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 42% in fiscal 2014. Online sales represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2014, compared to 12% for fiscal 2013.On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2014 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% mainly as a result of strong growth in our Basketball, Football (Soccer), Running, and Sportswear categories. Women's revenues increased 12% in large part due to increases in our Running, Sportswear, and Women's Training categories. The 16% increase in the Young Athletes' business was driven by increases in the Basketball and Football (Soccer) categories in part due to our expanded footwear and apparel offerings for this age group.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis, revenues from our NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2013, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography except Greater China delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2013. North America contributed 7 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Emerging Markets contributed 2 percentage points and Western and Central & Eastern Europe each contributed 1 percentage point. Greater China's results reduced NIKE, Inc. revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues for Converse contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth.Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 11% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 17% during fiscal 2013. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our Running, Basketball, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products, including Running models with NIKE Free and Lunar technologies, NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles, and performance Football (Soccer) products. In fiscal 2013, unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4%, driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products.For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by our Men's Training category (which includes the NFL licensed business), in addition to strong demand for Running and Basketball products. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 3%, reflecting a favorable mix of higher priced products, such as performance Running, Basketball, and NFL licensed apparel; and to a lesser extent, higher selling prices.For fiscal 2013, DTC channels represented approximately 18% of overall NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2012. On a currency neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 24% for fiscal 2013, as comparable store sales grew 14% and we continued to expand our store network and e-commerce businesses. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites grew 32% in fiscal 2013 and represented approximately 12% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2013.22Table of ContentsOn a wholesale equivalent and currency neutral basis, fiscal 2013 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% due primarily to growth in our Running, Men's Training, and Basketball categories. Women's revenues increased 9% driven primarily by an increase in Running and Women's Training. The 11% increase in the Young Athletes' business was due primarily to increases in Basketball.Futures OrdersFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2014 were 11% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, with unit orders and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 8 and 4 percentage points of growth, respectively.By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: Reported FuturesOrders Growth Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes(1)North America 11 % 11%Western Europe 25 % 22%Central & Eastern Europe 10 % 14%Greater China 6 % 6%Japan -6 % 0%Emerging Markets 2 % 9%Total NIKE Brand futures orders 11 % 12%(1)Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts, and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, NIKE Brand equipment, DTC operation sales, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf, and Hurley.Gross Margin(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change Fiscal 2012 % Change Gross profit $12,446 $11,034 13% $10,148 9% Gross margin % 44.8% 43.6% 120 bps 43.5% 10 bps Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 For fiscal 2014, our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2013, primarily driven by higher NIKE Brand average selling prices (increasing gross margin approximately 160 basis points), attributable to both price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products. Gross margin was also positively impacted by growth in our higher margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points) and improved margins due to cleaner closeout inventories (increasing margin approximately 20 basis points). These increases in gross margin were partially offset by higher product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points), primarily due to a shift in mix to higher cost products, as well as product labor input cost inflation. Gross margins were also negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points).Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013, our consolidated gross margin was 10 basis points higher than fiscal 2012, primarily driven by higher average selling prices (approximately 160 basis points) that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix. The positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs (approximately 110 basis points), primarily due to higher factory labor costs, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements (approximately 40 basis points).In addition, in fiscal 2013 we experienced significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business. While growth in these lower gross margin segments delivered incremental revenue and profits, it had a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin.23Table of ContentsTotal Selling and Administrative Expense(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change Fiscal 2012 % Change Demand creation expense(1) $3,031 $2,745 10% $2,607 5% Operating overhead expense(2) 5,735 5,051 14% 4,472 13% Total selling and administrative expense $8,766 $7,796 12% $7,079 10% % of Revenues 31.5% 30.8% 70 bps 30.3% 50 bps (1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts.(2)Fiscal 2013 and 2012 amounts have been revised to correctly expense internally developed patent and trademark costs as incurred. Refer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Demand creation expense increased 10% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by marketing support for events, including the World Cup, higher sports marketing expense, key product launches and initiatives, and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts. For fiscal 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Demand creation expense.Compared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 14%, primarily attributable to growth in our DTC business driven by new store openings, higher personnel costs, and e-commerce launches, as well as increased investments in our digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Operating overhead expense for fiscal 2014.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Demand creation expense increased 5% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE FuelBand and NFL launch, as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Demand creation expense increased 8%.Compared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 13%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our DTC operations, higher personnel costs, and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the growth in Operating overhead expense was 15%.Other Expense (Income), Net(In millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012Other expense (income), net $103 $(15) $54Other expense (income), net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Other expense (income), net shifted from $15 million of other (income), net for fiscal 2013 to $103 million of other expense, net, for fiscal 2014, primarily driven by a $90 million adverse change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses as well as an adverse legal judgment in the second quarter of the current year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in Western Europe.We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $139 million for fiscal 2014.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Other expense (income), net shifted from $54 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2012 to $15 million of other (income) net, for fiscal 2013. This change was primarily driven by a $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses as well as the recognition of a $24 million restructuring charge for NIKE Brand's Western Europe operations in fiscal 2012. These positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from non-operating items.We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $56 million for fiscal 2013.24Table of ContentsIncome Taxes Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change Fiscal 2012 % ChangeEffective tax rate 24.0% 24.7% (70) bps 25.0% (30) bpsFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 The 70 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, we reached a resolution with the IRS on an Advanced Pricing Agreement. This agreement did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 The 30 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by the U.S. legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.Discontinued OperationsDuring fiscal 2013, we divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse, and Hurley brands. The results of the divestiture are presented as discontinued operations. Please refer to Note 15 — Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail.Operating SegmentsOur reportable operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization, which changed beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The NIKE Brand segments continue to be defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity, which now includes the results of NIKE Golf and Hurley. Previously, NIKE Golf and Hurley were combined with Converse and reported as ""Other Businesses.""Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing, and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. The Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. The Company’s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for NIKE, Inc., and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing, and selling of casual sneakers, apparel, and accessories. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to fiscal 2014 presentation.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program.The breakdown of revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013(1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2) Fiscal 2012(1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)North America $12,299 $11,158 10 % 10% $9,538 17 % 17 %Western Europe 4,979 4,193 19 % 14% 4,212 0 % 5 %Central & Eastern Europe 1,387 1,229 13 % 15% 1,146 7 % 12 %Greater China 2,602 2,478 5 % 3% 2,561 -3 % -5 %Japan 771 876 -12 % 5% 920 -5 % 2 %Emerging Markets 3,949 3,832 3 % 13% 3,523 9 % 16 %Global Brand Divisions(3) 125 115 9 % 6% 111 4 % 7 %Total NIKE Brand Revenues 26,112 23,881 9 % 11% 22,011 8 % 11 %Converse 1,684 1,449 16 % 15% 1,324 9 % 10 %Corporate(4) 3 (17) — — (4) — —TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories fueled the revenue growth in fiscal 2014. DTC revenue growth in North America for fiscal 2014 was driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, the addition of 16 net new stores, and strong online sales growth.Footwear revenues growth in North America was driven by higher demand in nearly all key categories, led by our Basketball, Running, and Sportswear categories. For fiscal 2014, unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 4%. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven by price increases and shift in mix toward higher priced products in nearly equal amounts.26Table of ContentsNorth America apparel revenues growth was fueled by higher demand in all key categories, most notably our Men's Training, Women's Training, and Sportswear categories. Both unit sales and average selling price per unit increased, with unit sales increasing 6% and average selling price per unit increasing 4%. The increase in average selling price per unit was primarily driven by price increases, and to a lesser extent, a change in mix to higher priced products. North America EBIT increased at a faster rate than revenues due to gross margin expansion and slight selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 120 basis points for fiscal 2014, reflecting pricing initiatives as well as lower product costs as a result of favorable changes in product mix. These gross margin benefits were partially offset by higher off-price mix. Selling and administrative expenses grew in line with revenues as a result of higher operating overhead costs to support DTC growth and higher demand creation expense in support of the World Cup and key product and brand initiatives.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections, and compelling retail experiences to consumers in North America, driving increased demand for NIKE Brand products across all key categories except Action Sports. Our Basketball, Men's Training, Running, and Sportswear categories drove the revenue growth in fiscal 2013. North America's DTC revenue growth for fiscal 2013 was fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales as well as the addition of new stores and rapid growth in online sales.North America footwear revenues growth was driven by higher demand in all key categories, most notably Basketball, Running, and Sportswear. Both unit sales and average selling price per pair increased 7% in fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven approximately equally by price increases and a favorable mix of higher priced products.Apparel revenues growth in North America was driven by higher demand in our Men's Training category, reflecting the addition of the NFL licensed business, as well as Basketball, Women's Training, and Running. Unit sales increased 9% while average selling price per unit increased 11%, largely driven by a favorable mix of higher priced products. North America EBIT increased faster than revenues due to gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2013, reflecting the favorable impact of selling price increases, partially offset by higher product costs, an unfavorable mix of lower margin products, and royalties for the NFL business. Selling and administrative expenses increased versus fiscal 2012, though at a rate slower than revenues; the growth was largely driven by higher demand creation expense for the Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as well as key product initiatives, including the NFL launch, and higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business.Western Europe(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2012 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $3,299 $2,657 24% 20 % $2,538 5 % 10 %Apparel 1,427 1,289 11% 7 % 1,407 -8 % -4 %Equipment 253 247 2% -1 % 267 -7 % -3 %TOTAL REVENUES $4,979 $4,193 19% 14 % $4,212 0 % 5 %Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $4,022 $3,481 16% 11 % $3,623 -4 % 1 %Sales Direct to Consumer 957 712 34% 29 % 589 21 % 27 %TOTAL REVENUES $4,979 $4,193 19% 14 % $4,212 0 % 5 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $855 $643 33% $599 7 % Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 The ongoing implementation of the category offense in Western Europe yielded successful results in fiscal 2014. On a currency neutral basis, all territories in Western Europe reported revenue growth for fiscal 2014, except Italy and Iberia, which declined 7% and 1%, respectively. Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland), our largest territories in Western Europe, increased 20% and 23%, respectively. On a category basis, revenue growth in fiscal 2014 was fueled by our Running, Football (Soccer), and Sportswear categories. The growth in DTC revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by 17% growth in comparable store sales, rapid growth in online sales, and the addition of 19 net new stores.Constant currency footwear revenues growth in Western Europe reflected increases in every key category, most notably our Sportswear, Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball categories. Unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased 11% and average selling price per pair increased 9%. The increase in average price per pair was primarily the result of price increases, a shift in mix to higher priced products, and lower discounts. The constant currency increase in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to increases in Football (Soccer), Running, and Women's Training, partially offset by a decline in Sportswear. Unit sales increased 3% while average selling price per unit increased 4%, driven primarily by lower discounts on off-price closeout sales compared to the prior year. On a reported basis, Western Europe EBIT for fiscal 2014 grew at a faster rate than revenues as a result of a 150 basis point increase in gross margin and selling and administrative expense leverage. The gross margin increase was fueled by higher average selling prices, growth in our higher margin DTC business, lower discounts, and lower off-price mix, which more than offset unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product input costs. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percentage of revenue despite higher operating overhead costs to support growth in our DTC business and higher demand creation spending for sports marketing to support key events such as the World Cup.27Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis, most territories in Western Europe reported revenue growth for fiscal 2013, which more than offset revenues declines of 17% and 18% in Italy and Iberia, respectively, reflecting poor economic conditions in southern Europe. Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland and AGS territories increased 8% and 12%, respectively. The growth in DTC revenues reflected 17% growth in comparable store sales, the addition of 19 net new stores and strong growth in online sales. On a category basis, Western Europe's revenues growth was largely driven by growth in our Running and Basketball categories. Constant currency footwear revenues growth in Western Europe was primarily driven by growth in Running, Sportswear, and Basketball. Unit sales increased 7% and average selling price per pair increased 3%, the latter primarily the result of price increases. The constant currency decrease in Western Europe apparel revenues was due to a decline in Sportswear, partially offset by growth in Running, Men's Training, and Basketball. Unit sales in fiscal 2013 decreased 1% while average selling price per unit decreased 3%, as higher discounts on closeout sales more than offset selling price increases. The EBIT growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by a 200 basis point increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates; higher net average selling prices were mostly offset by higher product costs. The increase in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and Olympics in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, as well as higher sports marketing expense. Additionally, operating overhead costs increased to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business. Fiscal 2013 EBIT growth for Western Europe was also increased by a $24 million, one-time restructuring charge that was recorded in Other expense (income), net, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.

Gross margin increased 180 basis points, primarily driven by price increases, a shift in mix to higher margin products, warehousing efficiencies, and the favorable impact of our higher margin DTC business, partially offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased as a result of higher demand creation expense to support key events as well as higher operating overhead to support overall growth, including our expanding DTC business. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis, Central & Eastern Europe revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by growth across most territories, particularly Russia and Turkey, which grew 28% and 19%, respectively.

Unit sales increased 6% while average selling price per pair increased 5%, primarily driven by price increases. Constant currency apparel revenues growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in nearly all categories, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Running. Unit sales increased 16%, while average selling price per unit decreased 2%, as an unfavorable mix of lower priced products more than offset higher selling prices. EBIT for Central & Eastern Europe grew faster than revenues primarily due to gross margin improvement and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 30 basis points, largely driven by price increases and the favorable impact of our higher margin DTC business, more than offsetting higher product costs and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. 28Table of ContentsGreater China(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2012 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $1,600 $1,495 7 % 5 % $1,520 -2 % -3 %Apparel 876 844 4 % 1 % 910 -7 % -8 %Equipment 126 139 -9 % -11 % 131 6 % 4 %TOTAL REVENUES $2,602 $2,478 5 % 3 % $2,561 -3 % -5 %Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $2,041 $2,079 -2 % -4 % $2,266 -8 % -9 %Sales Direct to Consumer 561 399 41 % 38 % 295 35 % 33 %TOTAL REVENUES $2,602 $2,478 5 % 3 % $2,561 -3 % -5 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $816 $813 0 % $913 -11 % Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 3% in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by strong growth in our DTC business, which represented 22% of total Greater China revenues for fiscal 2014. The growth in DTC revenues reflected a 20% increase in comparable store sales, the addition of 30 net new stores, as well as online sales growth. The increase in DTC revenues more than offset a 4% decrease in sales in our wholesale business as we continued to manage the amount of product sold into the market and worked with our wholesale partners to optimize product mix for the consumer. On a category basis, higher revenues in our Basketball, Sportswear, and Running categories more than offset declines in Men's Training, Action Sports, and Women's Training.Constant currency footwear revenues growth for Greater China in fiscal 2014 was driven by increased sales in our Basketball and Sportswear categories, partially offset by declines in our Men's Training, Running, and Action Sports categories. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 were flat compared to the prior year while average selling price per pair increased 5%, driven by favorable revenue mix resulting from a higher percentage of sales from our higher price DTC business, as well as a shift in mix to higher priced product.Constant currency apparel revenues growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by increases in the Running, Sportswear, and Basketball categories, partially offset by decreases in Men's Training and Women's Training. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2014 were 1% higher while average selling price per unit was flat.Fiscal 2014 reported EBIT for Greater China was flat compared to the prior year as reported revenue and gross margin increases were offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Gross margin increased150 basis points as higher average selling prices, growth in our higher margin DTC business, and improved margins on closeout sales more than offset higher product input costs and unfavorable product mix. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs driven by increased investments to support DTC growth and our new Greater China headquarters in Shanghai, as well as higher demand creation spending.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis, Greater China revenues decreased in fiscal 2013, driven by lower futures orders as well as increased discounts, product returns and proactive cancellation of orders to manage inventory levels at retail. These downsides were partially offset by 33% growth in our DTC business driven by comparable store sales growth of 13% and the addition of 29 net new stores. Fiscal 2013 revenues for most key categories were lower than in fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2013, constant currency footwear revenues for Greater China declined, driven by lower sales across most key categories, most notably Sportswear, Men's Training, and Women's Training; and increased reserves for product discounts and returns. Unit sales decreased 1%, while average selling price per pair decreased 2%, reflecting a higher mix of closeout sales and higher discounts. The decrease in constant currency apparel revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by lower revenues in Sportswear, Men's Training, and Women's Training, partially offset by higher revenues in Basketball. Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 were 3% lower than the prior year while average selling price per unit was down 5%, reflecting a higher mix of closeout sales and higher discounts. Fiscal 2013 EBIT for Greater China decreased at a faster rate than revenues, driven by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense. Fiscal 2013 gross margin decreased 50 basis points due to a lower average selling price per unit driven by higher discounts and closeout mix partially offset by favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues, driven primarily by the increased investment in our DTC business and the decrease in revenues.29Table of ContentsJapan(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2012 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $409 $439 -7 % 11 % $447 -2 % 5 %Apparel 276 337 -18 % -2 % 364 -7 % -1 %Equipment 86 100 -14 % 2 % 109 -8 % 0 %TOTAL REVENUES $771 $876 -12 % 5 % $920 -5 % 2 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $131 $139 -6 % $135 3 % Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 On a currency neutral basis, revenues increased 5% for Japan, driven by higher revenues in Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Men's Training and NIKE Golf.Fiscal 2014 EBIT for Japan decreased 6% as a 12% decline in reported revenues, due to the weaker Yen, was only partially offset by higher gross margin and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 20 basis points as higher average selling prices, favorable off-price mix, and the favorable impact of higher margin DTC revenues were mostly offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2014 was attributable to lower operating overhead and demand creation spending.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the revenues increase for Japan was driven by higher revenues in Running, Football (Soccer), and Basketball, partially offset by lower revenues in Sportswear, Men's Training, and Women's Training. Fiscal 2013 EBIT for Japan increased as lower reported revenues were more than offset by gross margin improvement and lower selling and administrative expense. The decrease in selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2013 was attributable to both lower operating overhead and demand creation spending.

Our largest territory, Brazil, grew 19%, while our SOCO territory (which includes Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile) grew 25%. Mexico revenues decreased 3% as a result of shipping delays caused by issues with a distribution center transition in the first half of fiscal 2014. On a category basis, revenues were higher in nearly every category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, and Sportswear.Constant currency footwear revenues growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, led by Running, Sportswear, Football (Soccer), and Action Sports. Unit sales for fiscal 2014 increased 4% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by price increases, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain Latin American territories, and to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher priced product. Constant currency apparel revenues increased driven by growth in every key category, most notably Football (Soccer) and Running. Unit sales increased 11% and average selling price per unit increased 10%, primarily due to price increases, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain Latin American territories.Fiscal 2014 reported EBIT for Emerging Markets decreased primarily due to a decline in gross margin, higher selling and administrative expense, and weaker currencies in a number of developing markets. Gross margin decreased 30 basis points due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, higher product costs, higher warehousing costs related to distribution center transition challenges in Mexico, and higher discounts, which more than offset higher average selling prices and a favorable shift to higher priced products. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and infrastructure investments to support growth, as well as increases in demand creation spending to support the World Cup and key product launches.30Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013, constant currency revenues growth for the Emerging Markets geography was driven by growth in every key category and territory, led by SOCO, Brazil, and Mexico.Constant currency footwear revenues growth for fiscal 2013 was driven by growth in most key categories, most notably Running, Football (Soccer), and Women's Training. Unit sales increased approximately 9% and average selling price per pair increased 6%, primarily driven by selling price increases. Fiscal 2013 constant currency apparel revenues were driven by growth in every key category, led by Football (Soccer), Running, Sportswear, and Men's Training. Unit sales increased approximately 10% and average selling price per unit increased 9%, largely attributable to price increases.Fiscal 2013 Emerging Markets EBIT grew faster than revenue primarily driven by gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue. Gross margin increased 260 basis points due largely to the favorable impact of price increases, the anniversary of a one-time customs duty charge in fiscal 2012, and favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher product costs. As a percent of revenue, selling and administrative expense was higher due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our DTC business and overall growth of the business.Global Brand Divisions(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2012 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues $125 $115 9% 6% $111 4% 7%(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes $(2,021) $(1,746) 16% $(1,479) 18% Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation, operating overhead, and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.

The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. Converse does not own the Converse trademarks in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 15% for fiscal 2014. Revenue growth in direct distribution markets, which represent approximately 84% of Converse revenues, contributed 16 percentage points to the total increase for fiscal 2014, while licensing revenues decreased overall revenue by 1 percentage point. Revenues from our direct distribution markets grew 19% for fiscal 2014 driven by growth in ""comparable"" direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years), primarily the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Comparable direct distribution markets revenues increased 13%, contributing 12 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenues growth for fiscal 2014, while conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 7 percentage points. Comparable direct distribution markets unit sales increased 12% and average selling price per unit increased 1% for fiscal 2014. The increase in average selling price per unit resulted primarily from a favorable mix of higher priced product. Due to market conversions and business declines in Latin America, licensing revenues decreased 3% for fiscal 2014.On a reported basis, EBIT at Converse grew 17% for fiscal 2014 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 80 basis points, primarily due to growth in higher margin territories and products within our direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense grew faster than revenue for fiscal 2014 due to higher operating overhead to support growth initiatives and DTC expansion, as well as higher demand creation spending.31Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Constant currency revenues for Converse increased 10% for fiscal 2013. Revenue growth in direct distribution markets, which represented approximately 81% of Converse revenues, contributed 11 percentage points to the total increase for fiscal 2013, while licensing revenues decreased overall revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Revenues from our direct distribution markets grew 15% for fiscal 2013 driven by growth in comparable direct distribution markets, primarily the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Comparable direct distribution markets revenues increased 11%, contributing 10 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenues growth for fiscal 2013; conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 5 percentage points. Comparable direct distribution markets unit sales increased 6% and average selling price per unit increased 5% for fiscal 2013. The increase in average selling price per unit resulted primarily from a higher mix of higher priced product. Due to market conversions and business declines in Latin America, licensing revenues decreased 7% for fiscal 2013.On a reported basis, EBIT for Converse grew 8% for fiscal 2013 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 120 basis points, primarily due to growth in higher margin territories and products within our direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense grew faster than revenue for fiscal 2013 due to higher operating overhead to support growth initiatives and DTC expansion, as well as higher demand creation spending.Corporate(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change Fiscal 2012 % ChangeRevenues $3 $(17) — $(4) —(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes $(1,009) $(884) 14% $(674) 31%Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit, and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results included in gross margin are gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency hedge results.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 For fiscal 2014, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $125 million primarily due to the following:•a $99 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business as well as performance-based compensation;•a $90 million increase in foreign currency net losses, reported as a component of Other expense (income), net; and•a $56 million decrease in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin.Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $210 million primarily due to the following:•a $165 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin;•an $86 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business and performance-based compensation; and•a $48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses, reported as a component of Other expense (income), net. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging PracticesOverviewAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (""NTC"") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Transactional exposuresWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Some NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.32Table of ContentsFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net. Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in Other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations.Managing transactional exposuresTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales, and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below.Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 – Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end.Translational exposuresMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results, and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $288 million and $605 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $49 million and $104 million for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Managing translational exposuresTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end.We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $139 million and $56 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.33Table of ContentsNet investments in foreign subsidiariesWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of Other expense (income), net. The impact of ineffective hedges was immaterial for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in Other comprehensive income. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2014 and 2013. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2014 and 2013.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow ActivityCash provided by operations was $3,003 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $2,968 million for fiscal 2013. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2014 was net income of $2,693 million. Our fiscal 2014 change in working capital was a net cash outflow of $488 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $78 million for fiscal 2013. Our investments in working capital increased due to higher inventory levels to support higher reported futures orders, growth in accounts receivable reflecting the increase in sales, and higher prepaid marketing expenses in advance of the World Cup. These increases in working capital were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.Cash used by investing activities was $1,207 million during fiscal 2014, compared to a $940 million use of cash for fiscal 2013. A major driver of the change was a $282 million increase in additions to property, plant and equipment from $598 million in fiscal 2013 to $880 million in fiscal 2014, reflective of investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, as well as digital capabilities. In fiscal 2014, we made $328 million in net purchases of short-term investments (net of sales/maturities) compared to $1,140 million in net purchases (net of sales/maturities) in fiscal 2013. Cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2013 was partially offset by $786 million in proceeds from the sale of Umbro and Cole Haan.Cash used by financing activities was $2,914 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $1,045 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $1,869 million. The increase was primarily due to a $954 million increase in share repurchases to $2,628 million, a $986 million decrease in net proceeds from long term debt issuance (reflecting the issuance of 10- and 30-year notes in April 2013), and a $96 million increase in dividends, partially offset by a year-on-year increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.In fiscal 2014, we purchased 36.6 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $2,628 million, an average price of $71.80. During fiscal 2013, we completed the four-year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08. Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2014, we had repurchased 51.9 million shares at an average price of $65.83 for a total cost of $3,417 million under this current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.Capital ResourcesOn April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the ""Shelf"") with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. The Shelf expires on April 23, 2016. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million.On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. Following an extension agreement on September 17, 2013 between the Company and the syndicate of banks, the facility matures November 1, 2017, with a one-year extension option exercisable through October 31, 2014. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of May 31, 2014 or 2013.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2014, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2014, we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2015 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.As of May 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $5.1 billion, of which $2.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2014 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days.34Table of ContentsTo date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.Contractual ObligationsOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2014 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows:Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,(In millions) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter TotalOperating Leases $427 $399 $366 $311 $251 $1,050 $2,804Capital Leases 36 35 1 1 1 — 74Long-term Debt(1) 46 145 79 56 37 1,488 1,851Endorsement Contracts(2) 991 787 672 524 349 1,381 4,704Product Purchase Obligations(3) 3,688 — — — — — 3,688Other(4) 309 108 78 7 3 12 517TOTAL $5,497 $1,474 $1,196 $899 $641 $3,931 $13,638(1)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2014 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations.(2)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(3)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2014.(4)Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2014.35Table of ContentsThe total liability for uncertain tax positions was $506 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2014. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur.We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2014. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.(In millions)Outstanding as of May 31, 2014Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand$167Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port60As of May 31, 2014, letters of credit of $135 million were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsIn July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle, at the reporting date, any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, or tax credit carryforwards exist. This accounting standard is effective for us beginning June 1, 2014 and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.Critical Accounting PoliciesOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters.Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.Revenue RecognitionWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale.In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts, and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts, and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts, and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts, and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination.36Table of ContentsAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.Inventory ReservesWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement ContractsA significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in Demand creation expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be reported in a future period.Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period.Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived AssetsProperty, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value.We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.37Table of ContentsWe generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk, and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital. Fair Value MeasurementsFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. Agency securities, and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor.Hedge Accounting for DerivativesWe use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of forward and option contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other expense (income), net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.We have used and may in the future use, forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within Total shareholders’ equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as Other expense (income), net during the period in which changes occur.Stock-based CompensationWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.38Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination.On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues, and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.Other ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as Other expense (income), net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding, or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.39Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing, and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, and may in the future, also use forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. See section “Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed rate debt.Market Risk MeasurementWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing, and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $50 million and $34 million at May 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with a longer average duration on our outstanding trades at May 31, 2014. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $70 million and $49 million during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2015,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites (which we refer to as our “Direct to Consumer” or ""DTC"" operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online.In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas:•Expanding gross margin by:- Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value proposition for consumers;- Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation;- Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market; and- Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations.•Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on:- Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit;- Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and- Increasing the productivity of our legacy infrastructure.•Improving working capital efficiency; and•Deploying capital effectively.Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be:•High single-digit revenue growth,•Mid-teens earnings per share growth,•Strong return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows and•Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses.Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of these financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 23.2% to 28.1% and we expanded gross margins by approximately 150 basis points.On November 15, 2012, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares. The stock split was in the form of a 100% stock dividend payable on December 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2012. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 26, 2012. All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2015 results from continuing operations demonstrated NIKE's ongoing commitment to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings and cash returns to shareholders, while investing for long-term growth. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2015. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion, gross margin expanded 120 basis points, Net income from continuing operations increased 22% to $3.3 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 25% to $3.70.Earnings before interest and income taxes (""EBIT"") from continuing operations increased 18% for fiscal 2015, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. The increase in revenues was attributable to growth across nearly all NIKE Brand geographies, key categories and product types. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by:•Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; •Deep brand connections to consumers through a category lens, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events (such as the World Cup and NFL Super Bowl) and digital marketing; and•Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. Our Converse business also grew, with revenue and EBIT growth of 18% and 4%, respectively. Gross margin increased primarily due to higher average selling prices and the favorable impact of our higher-margin DTC businesses, partially offset by higher product input costs, primarily a result of labor input cost inflation and shifts in mix to higher-cost products.For fiscal 2015, the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 180 basis points primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions. In addition, diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program. 20Table of ContentsWhile foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.Results of Operations Unless otherwise indicated, the following disclosures reflect the Company’s continuing operations.(Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change Fiscal 2013 % ChangeRevenues $30,601 $27,799 10% $25,313 10%Cost of sales 16,534 15,353 8% 14,279 8%Gross profit 14,067 12,446 13% 11,034 13%Gross margin % 46.0% 44.8% 43.6% Demand creation expense 3,213 3,031 6% 2,745 10%Operating overhead expense 6,679 5,735 16% 5,051 14%Total selling and administrative expense 9,892 8,766 13% 7,796 12%% of Revenues 32.3% 31.5% 30.8% Interest expense (income), net 28 33 — (3) —Other (income) expense, net (58) 103 — (15) —Income before income taxes 4,205 3,544 19% 3,256 9%Income tax expense 932 851 10% 805 6%Effective tax rate 22.2% 24.0% 24.7% Net income from continuing operations 3,273 2,693 22% 2,451 10%Net income from discontinued operations(1) — — — 21 —Net income $3,273 $2,693 22% $2,472 9%Diluted earnings per common share - continuing operations $3.70 $2.97 25% $2.68 11%Diluted earnings per common share - discontinued operations(1) $— $— — $0.02 —(1)During fiscal 2013, we divested of Umbro and Cole Haan, allowing us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands.

NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers.(6)Others include all unisex products, equipment and other products not allocated to Men’s, Women’s and Young Athletes’, as well as certain adjustments that are not allocated to products designated by gender or age.(7)Others include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 On a currency-neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 14% for fiscal 2015, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2015 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe contributed 4 percentage points, Greater China contributed 2 percentage points and Central & Eastern Europe, Emerging Markets and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 17% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 1% during fiscal 2015. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by strong performance in our Sportswear, Basketball, Running and Football (Soccer) categories. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2015 increased 9% and increases in average selling price per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was driven primarily by shifts in mix to higher-priced products, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, which were partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) due largely to the comparison to significant sales of replica apparel in advance of the World Cup in 2014. Fiscal 2015 unit sales of apparel increased 8% and increases in average selling price per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per unit was driven primarily by increased revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE-owned websites. For fiscal 2015, DTC revenues represented approximately 23% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 20% in fiscal 2014. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 29% for fiscal 2015, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 16%, significant online sales growth and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 59% in fiscal 2015. Online sales represented approximately 18% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 15% for fiscal 2014.On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2015 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 9%, driven by growth in our Sportswear, Basketball and Running categories. Women’s revenues accelerated in fiscal 2015, achieving 20% growth primarily due to increases in Sportswear, Running and Women's Training categories. Revenues in our Young Athletes' business increased 19% as a result of continued efforts to expand footwear and apparel offerings for this group across multiple categories, particularly Basketball.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 On a currency-neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 11% for fiscal 2014, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2014. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe and Emerging Markets each contributed 2 percentage points and Central & Eastern Europe and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 4% during fiscal 2014. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2014 was mainly due to growth in our Basketball, Sportswear, Running and Football (Soccer) categories. Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 7% and the average selling price per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven nearly equally by price increases and shifts in mix to higher-priced products. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably our Football (Soccer), Running and Women's Training categories. In fiscal 2014, unit sales of apparel increased approximately 6% and the average selling price per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven by price increases and, to a lesser extent, a shift in mix to higher-priced products.For fiscal 2014, DTC revenues represented approximately 20% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 18% in fiscal 2013. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 22% for fiscal 2014, as comparable store sales grew 10%, and we continued to open new stores and expand our e-commerce business. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites grew 42% in fiscal 2014. Online sales represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 12% for fiscal 2013.23Table of ContentsOn a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2014 NIKE Brand Men's revenues increased 9% mainly as a result of strong growth in our Basketball, Football (Soccer), Running and Sportswear categories. Women's revenues increased 12% in large part due to increases in our Running, Sportswear and Women's Training categories. The 16% increase in the Young Athletes' business was driven by increases in the Basketball and Football (Soccer) categories in part due to our expanded footwear and apparel offerings for this age group.Futures OrdersFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2015 were 2% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 13%, with unit orders and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 8 and 5 percentage points of growth, respectively.By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: Reported Futures Orders Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes(1)North America 13 % 13%Western Europe -11 % 14%Central & Eastern Europe -9 % 17%Greater China 20 % 22%Japan 1 % 20%Emerging Markets -14 % 2%TOTAL NIKE BRAND FUTURES ORDERS 2 % 13%(1)Reported futures have been restated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our DTC operations and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.Gross Margin(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change Fiscal 2013 % Change Gross profit $14,067 $12,446 13% $11,034 13% Gross margin % 46.0% 44.8% 120 bps 43.6% 120 bps Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 For fiscal 2015, our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2014, primarily driven by the following factors:•Higher NIKE Brand average net selling prices (increasing gross margin approximately 250 basis points) primarily attributable to shifts in mix to higher-priced products and, to a lesser extent, increased prices, in part in response to inflationary conditions in certain territories;•Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 190 basis points) largely due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products, labor input cost inflation and higher air freight costs, in part to mitigate the negative impacts from product delays due to the West Coast port congestion in the United States;•Growth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points); and•Changes in foreign currency exchange rates (including gains and losses on hedge transactions) increased gross margin approximately 20 basis points.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 For fiscal 2014, our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2013, primarily driven by the following factors:•Higher NIKE Brand average net selling prices (increasing gross margin approximately 160 basis points) attributable to both shifts in mix to higher-priced products and price increases;•Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points), primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products, as well as labor input cost inflation;•Growth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points);•Improved margins due to cleaner closeout inventories (increasing margin approximately 20 basis points); and•Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points). 24Table of ContentsTotal Selling and Administrative Expense(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change Fiscal 2013 % Change Demand creation expense(1) $3,213 $3,031 6% $2,745 10% Operating overhead expense 6,679 5,735 16% 5,051 14% Total selling and administrative expense $9,892 $8,766 13% $7,796 12% % of Revenues 32.3% 31.5% 80 bps 30.8% 70 bps (1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Demand creation expense increased 6% for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to support for key brand and consumer events, including the World Cup in early fiscal 2015, increased digital brand marketing, investments in DTC marketing and higher sports marketing expense. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2015.Operating overhead expense increased 16% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by investments in our rapidly growing DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities and higher performance-based compensation. For fiscal 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 3 percentage points.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Demand creation expense increased 10% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by marketing support for events, including the World Cup, higher sports marketing expense, key product launches and initiatives and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts. For fiscal 2014, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Demand creation expense.Compared to the prior year, Operating overhead expense increased 14%, primarily attributable to growth in our DTC business driven by new store openings, higher personnel costs and e-commerce launches, as well as increased investments in our digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Operating overhead expense for fiscal 2014.Other (Income) Expense, Net(In millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013Other (income) expense, net $(58) $103 $(15)Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Other (income) expense, net shifted from $103 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2014 to $58 million of other (income), net for fiscal 2015, primarily driven by a $147 million change to net foreign currency conversion gains, primarily due to significant hedge gains from available-for-sale investments, as well as an adverse legal judgment in the prior year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in Western Europe.We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international business and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $73 million for fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Other (income) expense, net shifted from $15 million of other (income), net for fiscal 2013 to $103 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2014, primarily driven by a $90 million adverse change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses as well as an adverse legal judgment in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in Western Europe.We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $139 million for fiscal 2014.Income Taxes Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change Fiscal 2013 % ChangeEffective tax rate 22.2% 24.0% (180) bps 24.7% (70) bpsFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 The 180 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions.25Table of ContentsFiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 The 70 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, we reached a resolution with the IRS on an Advanced Pricing Agreement. This agreement did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure.Operating SegmentsOur reportable operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company’s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for NIKE, Inc., and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established.

Revenue growth was driven by nearly all key categories for fiscal 2015, led by our Basketball, Sportswear and Men's and Women's Training categories. On a constant currency basis, DTC revenue grew 17% for fiscal 2015, fueled by comparable store sales growth of 8%, strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores.Footwear revenue growth was driven by increases in most key categories, notably Basketball and Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear for fiscal 2015 increased 6% and higher average selling price per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per pair was primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-priced products, and to a lesser extent, price increases.Apparel revenue growth was attributable to strong demand in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men's Training, Women's Training and Running, partially offset by slight declines in Football (Soccer) and Action Sports. For fiscal 2015, unit sales of apparel increased 9% and higher average selling price per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in average selling price per unit was driven primarily by the favorable impact of our higher-priced DTC business, as well as shifts in mix to higher-priced products.EBIT grew 18% for fiscal 2015 as a result of higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 110 basis points due to shifts in mix to higher-priced products, improved off-price product margins and lower inventory obsolescence costs, partially offset by higher product input and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher demand creation expense to support key brand and sporting events and higher sports marketing expense. Operating overhead costs also increased to support DTC growth and investments in infrastructure, as well as higher performance-based compensation costs.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Our continued focus on the category offense drove increased demand for NIKE Brand products across all key categories for fiscal 2014.

Demand creation expense increased slightly due to support for the World Cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and key brand and consumer events.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 For fiscal 2014, Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased $277 million, primarily driven by an increase in centrally managed product costs, increased investments in our digital infrastructure, as well as higher demand creation spending in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to support the World Cup and product creation and design initiatives.32Table of ContentsConverse(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2013 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues $1,982 $1,684 18% 21% $1,449 16% 15%Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $517 $496 4% $425 17% In territories we define as “direct distribution markets” Converse designs, markets and sells products directly to distributors, wholesale customers and to consumers through DTC operations. The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. Converse does not own the Converse trademarks in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalties to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 21% for fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) grew 14%, contributing 12 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12% and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of Converse comparable direct distribution market revenue growth. The United States market was the most significant contributor to the growth of comparable direct distribution markets due to volume increases with key wholesale customers and expansion of our DTC business. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 8 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2015, driven by conversion of several European markets, most significantly AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland). Revenues from comparable licensed markets increased 8% for fiscal 2015, contributing 1 percentage point of total Converse revenue growth.EBIT for Converse increased 4% for fiscal 2015 as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased 60 basis points primarily due to transitions of licensed markets to direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher operating overhead costs resulting from investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, including market transitions, new systems and new headquarters, as well as higher intellectual property enforcement costs.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 15% for fiscal 2014. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 13%, contributing 10 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2014, primarily due to strength in our United States, China and United Kingdom markets. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12% and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of Converse comparable direct distribution market revenue growth. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2014. Revenues from comparable licensed markets increased 8% for fiscal 2014, contributing 1 percentage point of total Converse revenue growth.On a reported basis, EBIT at Converse grew 17% for fiscal 2014 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 80 basis points, primarily due to growth in higher-margin territories and products within our direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense grew faster than revenue for fiscal 2014 due to higher operating overhead to support growth initiatives and DTC expansion, as well as higher demand creation spending.Corporate(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change Fiscal 2013 % ChangeRevenues $(82) $3 — $(17) —(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes $(1,101) $(1,036) 6% $(909) 14%Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.33Table of ContentsFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 For fiscal 2015, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $65 million primarily due to the following:•a $211 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support growth of the business as well as performance-based compensation;•a $144 million beneficial change from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net; and•an approximate $2 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 For fiscal 2014, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased by $127 million primarily due to the following:•a $101 million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business as well as performance-based compensation;•a $90 million increase in net foreign currency losses, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net; and•a $56 million decrease in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin.Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging PracticesOverviewAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (""NTC"") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Transactional ExposuresWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities, including those supporting our North America, Greater China, Japan and European geographies, purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.34Table of Contents2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.Managing Transactional ExposuresTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below.Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.Translational ExposuresMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,171 million and $288 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $221 million and $49 million for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Managing Translational ExposuresTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 35Table of ContentsRefer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $73 million and $139 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Net Investments in Foreign SubsidiariesWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for net investment hedges. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2015 and 2014. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2015 and 2014.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow ActivityCash provided by operations was $4,680 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $3,013 million for fiscal 2014. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2015 was Net income of $3,273 million. Our fiscal 2015 change in working capital was a net cash inflow of $256 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $488 million for fiscal 2014. Our investments in working capital decreased due to increases in Accrued liabilities, primarily resulting from the receipt of $968 million of cash collateral from counterparties as a result of hedging activity. These amounts were partially offset by higher inventory levels resulting from business growth and West Coast port delays in North America, as well as lower Income taxes payable as a result of tax payments made in fiscal 2015 following the U.S. Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreement reached with the IRS in fiscal 2014.Cash used by investing activities was $175 million for fiscal 2015, compared to a $1,207 million use of cash for fiscal 2014. The primary driver of the decrease in Cash used by investing activities was the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) from net purchases to net sales/maturities. In fiscal 2015, there were $935 million of net sales/maturities compared to $328 million of net purchases of short-term investments in the same period of fiscal 2014. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $963 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to $880 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in Additions to property, plant and equipment resulted from continued investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, primarily relating to expansion of our DTC operations as well as supply chain and corporate initiatives.In fiscal 2016, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, as well as expand our digital capabilities. We anticipate investing approximately 4% of revenue, a portion of which will be used for the continued expansion of our corporate facilities, new DTC stores and digital capabilities.Cash used by financing activities was $2,790 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $2,914 million for fiscal 2014, a decrease of $124 million, as increased dividends were more than offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. In fiscal 2015, we purchased 29.0 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $2,534 million, an average price of $87.37. During fiscal 2013, we completed the four-year, $5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Under that program, we purchased a total of 118.8 million shares at an average price of $42.08. Subsequently, we began repurchases under a four-year, $8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012. As of the end of fiscal 2015, we had repurchased 80.9 million shares at an average price of $73.55 for a total cost of $5,950 million under this current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.Capital ResourcesOn April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the ""Shelf"") with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. The Shelf expires on April 23, 2016. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million.On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with lender approval. The facility matures November 1, 2017. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2015, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.36Table of ContentsLiquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2015, we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. We may issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2016 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.As of May 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.9 billion, of which $4.2 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Included in Cash and equivalents as of May 31, 2015 was $968 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity. Cash equivalents and Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2015 the weighted average remaining duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 79 days.To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.Contractual ObligationsOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2015 and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,(In millions) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter TotalOperating Leases $447 $423 $371 $311 $268 $1,154 $2,974Capital Leases 2 2 1 — — — 5Long-term Debt(1) 142 77 55 36 36 1,451 1,797Endorsement Contracts(2) 1,009 919 882 706 533 2,143 6,192Product Purchase Obligations(3) 3,735 — — — — — 3,735Other(4) 343 152 75 72 36 92 770TOTAL $5,678 $1,573 $1,384 $1,125 $873 $4,840 $15,473(1)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2015 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(2)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(3)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2015.(4)Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2015.37Table of ContentsThe total liability for uncertain tax positions was $438 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2015. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur.We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2015. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.(In millions)Outstanding as of May 31, 2015Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand$74Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port78As of May 31, 2015, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $165 million. These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsIn July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits, reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle, at the reporting date, any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses or tax credit carryforwards exist. This accounting standard was effective for us beginning June 1, 2014 and early adoption was permitted. We early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This accounting standard update was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Based on the FASB's decision in July 2015 to defer the effective date and to allow more flexibility with implementation, we anticipate the new standard will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2018. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.Critical Accounting PoliciesOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters.Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.Revenue RecognitionWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.38Table of ContentsIn some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.Inventory ReservesWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement ContractsA significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the guarantee period.Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived AssetsProperty, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value.We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.39Table of ContentsGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Fair Value MeasurementsFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as time deposits, commercial paper and bonds, U.S. Agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a comparison to another independent pricing vendor.Hedge Accounting for DerivativesWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.We have, in the past, used and may, in the future use, forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within Total shareholders’ equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as Other (income) expense, net during the period in which changes occur.40Table of ContentsStock-based CompensationWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.Income TaxesWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination.On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.Other ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding, or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.41Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and options contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may, in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2015 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. See section “Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, fixed-rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed-rate debt as well as pay-fixed, receive-variable forward-starting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments on future debt.Market Risk MeasurementWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $117 million and $50 million at May 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio, a longer weighted average duration on our outstanding trades and an increase in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2015. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $205 million and $70 million during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.During the year ended May 31, 2015, we entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. A forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. We entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates.Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates at May 31, 2015.42Table of Contents Expected Maturity DateYear Ending May 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total Fair ValueForeign Exchange Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $5 $5 $5 $5 $5 $4 $29 $31Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% Interest Rate Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $5 $5 $5 $5 $5 $4 $29 $31Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% U.S. Dollar Functional Currency Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate swapped to Floating rate Principal payments $100 $— $— $— $— $— $100 $102Average interest rate 0.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.4% Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $1 $38 $18 $— $— $1,000 $1,057 $1,027Average interest rate 6.4% 6.2% 6.8% 0.0% 0.0% 2.9% 3.1% Anticipated long-term U.S. Dollar debt issuance - Floating rate swapped to fixed rate Notional(1) $1,000 $— $— $— $— $— $1,000 $76Weighted-average fixed rate 2.3% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Weighted-average floating rate 0.3% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% (1) Forward-starting interest rate swaps have been included in the maturities category based on when the related hedged forecasted debt issuance and corresponding swap terminations are expected to occur.The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2016,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites (which we refer to collectively as our “Direct to Consumer” or “DTC” operations) and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online.In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas:•Expanding gross margin by:- Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value equation for consumers;- Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation;- Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market; and- Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business, led by NIKE.com, as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations.•Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on:- Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit;- Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and- Investments in key areas of future growth, including our DTC business.•Managing working capital efficiency; and•Deploying capital effectively.Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows:•High single-digit to low-double digit revenue growth;•Mid-teens earnings per share growth;•High-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital; •Free cash flow growing faster than net income; and•Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses.Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. We expanded gross margin by approximately 220 basis points and our return on invested capital has increased from 22.6% to 29.7%.On November 19, 2015, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. Our fiscal 2016 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2016. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion, gross margin expanded 20 basis points, Net income increased 15% and diluted earnings per common share grew 17% to $2.16. We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth.Earnings before interest and income taxes (""EBIT"") increased 10% for fiscal 2016, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, while selling and administrative expense was flat as a percent of revenues. The increase in revenues was attributable to growth for nearly every NIKE Brand geography and across most key categories and product types. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by:•Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; •Deep brand connections with consumers through our category offense, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; and•Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. Converse revenues and EBIT decreased 1% and 6%, respectively, as growth in direct distribution markets was more than offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Gross margin increased primarily due to higher full-price average selling price and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-margin DTC businesses, partially offset by higher product costs, primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation, higher off-price mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.21Table of ContentsFor fiscal 2016, the growth in Net income was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 350 basis points primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than Net income due to a 1% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change Fiscal 2014 % ChangeRevenues $32,376 $30,601 6 % $27,799 10%Cost of sales 17,405 16,534 5 % 15,353 8%Gross profit 14,971 14,067 6 % 12,446 13%Gross margin % 46.2% 46.0% 44.8% Demand creation expense 3,278 3,213 2 % 3,031 6%Operating overhead expense 7,191 6,679 8 % 5,735 16%Total selling and administrative expense 10,469 9,892 6 % 8,766 13%% of Revenues 32.3% 32.3% 31.5% Interest expense (income), net 19 28 — 33 —Other (income) expense, net (140) (58) — 103 —Income before income taxes 4,623 4,205 10 % 3,544 19%Income tax expense 863 932 -7 % 851 10%Effective tax rate 18.7% 22.2% 24.0% Net income $3,760 $3,273 15 % $2,693 22%Diluted earnings per common share $2.16 $1.85 17 % $1.49 24%22Table of ContentsConsolidated Operating ResultsRevenues(Dollars in millions)Fiscal 2016Fiscal 2015(1)% Change% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)Fiscal 2014(1)% Change% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)NIKE, Inc.

(4)Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.(5)References to NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no Direct to Consumer operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers.(6)Others include all unisex products, equipment and other products not allocated to Men’s, Women’s and Young Athletes’, as well as certain adjustments that are not allocated to products designated by gender or age.(7)Others include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 12% for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand. Every NIKE Brand geography grew revenues for fiscal 2016 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving strong demand for NIKE Brand products. North America contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Greater China and Western Europe each contributed approximately 3 percentage points, Emerging Markets contributed approximately 2 percentage points and Central & Eastern Europe contributed approximately 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 15% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 2%. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 9%, with higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men's Training, Running, Women's Training and Football (Soccer). Apparel unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in our higher-priced DTC business.While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE-owned websites. For fiscal 2016, DTC revenues represented approximately 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 25% for fiscal 2016, driven by strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 10%. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 51% in fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2016, online sales represented approximately 22% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues.On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 11%, driven by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, while Women's revenues increased 17%, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes' business increased 11%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 On a currency-neutral basis, revenues from NIKE, Inc. continuing operations grew 14% for fiscal 2015, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2015 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers. North America contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. revenues, while Western Europe contributed 4 percentage points, Greater China contributed 2 percentage points and Central & Eastern Europe, Emerging Markets and Converse each contributed 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 17% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 1% during fiscal 2015. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by strong performance in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, Running, NIKE Basketball and Football (Soccer). Footwear unit sales in fiscal 2015 increased 9%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven primarily by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, which were partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) due largely to the comparison to significant sales of replica apparel in advance of the World Cup in 2014. Fiscal 2015 unit sales of apparel increased 8% with higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in our higher-priced DTC business.For fiscal 2015, DTC revenues represented approximately 23% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 20% in fiscal 2014. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues grew 29% for fiscal 2015, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 16%, significant online sales growth and the addition of new stores. Online sales through NIKE-owned websites grew 59% in fiscal 2015. Online sales represented approximately 18% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 15% for fiscal 2014.24Table of ContentsOn a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2015 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 9%, driven by growth in our Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, NIKE Basketball and Running categories. Women’s revenues accelerated in fiscal 2015, achieving 20% growth primarily due to increases in Sportswear, Running and Women's Training categories. Revenues in our Young Athletes' business increased 19% as a result of continued efforts to expand footwear and apparel offerings for this group across multiple categories, particularly the Jordan Brand.Futures OrdersFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2016 totaled $14.9 billion and were 8% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. NIKE Brand reported futures include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 11%, with unit orders increasing 4% and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 7 percentage points of growth.By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: Reported Futures Orders Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes(1)North America 6% 6%Western Europe 8% 11%Central & Eastern Europe 3% 7%Greater China 19% 24%Japan 24% 15%Emerging Markets 3% 13%TOTAL NIKE BRAND FUTURES ORDERS 8% 11%(1)Reported futures have been restated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.Gross Margin(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change Fiscal 2014 % ChangeGross profit $14,971 $14,067 6% $12,446 13%Gross margin % 46.2% 46.0% 20 bps 44.8% 120 bpsFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015For fiscal 2016, our consolidated gross margin was 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015, primarily attributable to the following factors:•Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP (increasing gross margin approximately 190 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products with higher prices and, to a lesser extent, due to price increases reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories;•Growth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points);•Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) as shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation were only partially offset by lower material input costs;•Higher off-price mix (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points), primarily reflecting the impacts from clearing excess inventory in North America;•Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points); •Higher other costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily due to higher product design and development costs; and•Lower gross margin from Converse (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily resulting from shifts in mix to lower-margin products.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 For fiscal 2015, our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2014, primarily driven by the following factors:•Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP (increasing gross margin approximately 250 basis points) primarily attributable to shifts in mix to higher-priced products and, to a lesser extent, price increases in response to inflationary conditions in certain territories;25Table of Contents•Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 190 basis points) largely due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products, labor input cost inflation and higher air freight costs, in part to mitigate the negative impacts from product delays due to the West Coast port congestion in the United States;•Growth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points); and•Changes in foreign currency exchange rates (including gains and losses on hedge transactions) increased gross margin approximately 20 basis points.Total Selling and Administrative Expense(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change Fiscal 2014 % ChangeDemand creation expense(1) $3,278 $3,213 2% $3,031 6%Operating overhead expense 7,191 6,679 8% 5,735 16%Total selling and administrative expense $10,469 $9,892 6% $8,766 13%% of Revenues 32.3% 32.3% — 31.5% 80 bps(1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015Demand creation expense increased 2% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to investments in digital brand marketing, including for our DTC business, as well as support for key brand events and initiatives, and sports marketing investments, partially offset by lower advertising expense. For fiscal 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 6 percentage points.Operating overhead expense increased 8% compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of continued investments in our DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, as well as targeted investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2016.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Demand creation expense increased 6% for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to support for key brand and consumer events, including the World Cup in early fiscal 2015, increased digital brand marketing, investments in DTC marketing and higher sports marketing expense. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2015.Operating overhead expense increased 16% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by investments in our rapidly growing DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities and higher performance-based compensation. For fiscal 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 3 percentage points.Other (Income) Expense, Net(In millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014Other (income) expense, net $(140) $(58) $103Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Other (income) expense, net increased from $58 million of other income, net for fiscal 2015 to $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016, driven by a $26 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, a favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case in Western Europe and net gains from other non-operating items. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international business and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $423 million for fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Other (income) expense, net shifted from $103 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2014 to $58 million of other income, net for fiscal 2015, primarily driven by a $147 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, primarily due to significant hedge gains from available-for-sale investments, as well as an adverse legal judgment in the prior year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in Western Europe.We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international business and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $73 million for fiscal 2015.26Table of ContentsIncome Taxes Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change Fiscal 2014 % ChangeEffective tax rate 18.7% 22.2% (350) bps 24.0% (180) bpsFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 The 350 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 The 180 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions.Operating SegmentsOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company’s internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company’s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.The breakdown of revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015(1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2) Fiscal 2014(1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)North America $14,764 $13,740 7 % 8 % $12,299 12 % 12 %Western Europe 5,884 5,705 3 % 14 % 4,979 15 % 21 %Central & Eastern Europe 1,431 1,421 1 % 17 % 1,387 2 % 15 %Greater China 3,785 3,067 23 % 27 % 2,602 18 % 19 %Japan 869 755 15 % 22 % 771 -2 % 9 %Emerging Markets 3,701 3,898 -5 % 13 % 3,949 -1 % 8 %Global Brand Divisions(3) 73 115 -37 % -30 % 125 -8 % -2 %Total NIKE Brand Revenues 30,507 28,701 6 % 13 % 26,112 10 % 14 %Converse 1,955 1,982 -1 % 2 % 1,684 18 % 21 %Corporate(4) (86) (82) — — 3 — —TOTAL NIKE, INC.

As discussed in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in EBIT of our operating segments.27Table of ContentsThe breakdown of earnings before interest and taxes is as follows:(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015(1) % Change Fiscal 2014(1) % ChangeNorth America $3,763 $3,645 3 % $3,077 18 %Western Europe 1,434 1,275 12 % 855 49 %Central & Eastern Europe 289 249 16 % 279 -11 %Greater China 1,372 993 38 % 816 22 %Japan 174 100 74 % 131 -24 %Emerging Markets 892 818 9 % 952 -14 %Global Brand Divisions (2,596) (2,267) -15 % (1,993) -14 %Total NIKE Brand 5,328 4,813 11 % 4,117 17 %Converse 487 517 -6 % 496 4 %Corporate (1,173) (1,097) -7 % (1,036) -6 %TOTAL CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES 4,642 4,233 10 % 3,577 18 %Interest expense (income), net 19 28 — 33 —TOTAL CONSOLIDATED INCOMEBEFORE INCOME TAXES $4,623 $4,205 10 % $3,544 19 %(1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2016 presentation.

DTC revenues grew 17% for fiscal 2016, fueled by strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 6%.Currency-neutral footwear revenue growth was attributable to higher revenues in most key categories, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a slight decline in NIKE Basketball. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 8%. Higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix.Apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by our Sportswear and Men's Training categories. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of apparel grew 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP. Reported EBIT increased 3% for fiscal 2016 as higher revenues were largely offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin declined 80 basis points as higher off-price mix, higher warehousing and inventory obsolescence costs, as well as higher product input costs more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead to support our growing DTC operations and bad debt expense related to customer bankruptcies was only partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. Demand creation also grew at a faster rate than revenues due to higher spending for sports marketing, DTC marketing and key brand events and initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising expense.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 North America revenues increased 12%, despite congestion at ports on the West Coast of the United States in the second half of the fiscal year, which affected the Company's supply chain and flow of product to customers. Revenue growth was driven by nearly all key categories for fiscal 2015, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Men's Training, NIKE Basketball and Women's Training. On a constant currency basis, DTC revenue grew 17% for fiscal 2015, fueled by comparable store sales growth of 8%, strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores.28Table of ContentsFootwear revenue growth was driven by increases in most key categories, notably the Jordan Brand, NIKE Basketball and Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear for fiscal 2015 increased 6%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP.Apparel revenue growth was attributable to strong demand in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men's Training, Women's Training and Running, partially offset by slight declines in Football (Soccer) and Action Sports. For fiscal 2015, unit sales of apparel increased 9%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven primarily by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business.EBIT grew 18% for fiscal 2015 as a result of higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 110 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, improved off-price product margins and lower inventory obsolescence costs, partially offset by higher product input and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher demand creation expense to support key brand and sporting events and higher sports marketing expense. Operating overhead costs also increased to support DTC growth and investments in infrastructure, as well as higher performance-based compensation costs.Western Europe(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2014 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $3,985 $3,876 3 % 14% $3,299 17% 25%Apparel 1,628 1,552 5 % 16% 1,427 9% 14%Equipment 271 277 -2 % 8% 253 9% 15%TOTAL REVENUES $5,884 $5,705 3 % 14% $4,979 15% 21%Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $4,429 $4,451 0 % 10% $4,022 11% 17%Sales Direct to Consumer 1,455 1,254 16 % 28% 957 31% 40%TOTAL REVENUES $5,884 $5,705 3 % 14% $4,979 15% 21%EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $1,434 $1,275 12 % $855 49% Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Western Europe revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 14% with double-digit growth in every territory. Growth was led by our largest territories, the UK & Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland), which grew 12% and 16%, respectively. On a category basis, revenues grew for every key category, most notably Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2016, due to strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 13%.Currency-neutral footwear revenue growth was fueled by increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 10%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix.The constant currency apparel revenue growth was attributable to increases in every key category, most notably Sportswear, with Football (Soccer) also providing strong growth. Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2016 increased 11%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily driven by the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business and higher full-price ASP.On a reported basis, EBIT grew 12% for fiscal 2016, despite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro. EBIT grew at a higher rate than revenue as selling and administrative expense leverage and the favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case reflected in Other (income) expense, net, were only partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher off-price mix were mostly offset by higher full-price ASP, shifts in mix to lower-cost products and growth in our higher-margin DTC business. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead, primarily to support DTC expansion. Demand creation increased slightly as higher spending for DTC and other demand creation costs more than offset lower sports marketing costs.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 21% and grew in every territory, led by AGS and the UK & Ireland, our largest territories in Western Europe, which grew 27% and 20%, respectively.

DTC revenues grew 40%, driven by comparable store sales growth of 24%, strong online sales growth and the addition of new stores.The constant currency footwear revenue growth was driven by increases in nearly every category, most notably Sportswear, Running and Football (Soccer). For fiscal 2015, unit sales of footwear increased 20%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven equally by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business.The constant currency apparel revenue growth was attributable to increases in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running, partially offset by a slight decline in Football (Soccer) primarily due to the impact of World Cup in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel in fiscal 2015 increased 14% while ASP per unit was flat.29Table of ContentsDespite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro, reported EBIT grew 49% for fiscal 2015 as a result of strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 190 basis points, primarily due to favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher full-price ASP, which were only partially offset by higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite increases in operating overhead, primarily as a result of higher costs to support our growing DTC business.

For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was attributable to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.The constant currency growth in apparel revenue was due to increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of apparel decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 13 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was due to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.On a reported basis, EBIT increased 9%, despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso, Mexican Peso and Korean Won, as gross margin expansion more than offset lower reported revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin expanded 350 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, lower warehousing and obsolescence costs, and growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by shifts in mix to higher-cost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense declined on a reported basis, but was higher as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead due to additional investments in our DTC business and operating infrastructure, and higher performance-based compensation were more than offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Demand creation expense also increased driven by sports marketing and digital brand marketing costs, offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2015 revenues for Emerging Markets increased 8%, driven by growth in 7 of 9 territories. Growth was led by SOCO and Pacific which grew 28% and 26%, respectively. Revenues in our Mexico and Brazil territories decreased 21% and 3%, respectively. The decrease in Mexico was attributable to efforts to liquidate excess inventory in the marketplace largely resulting from an inconsistent flow of product to customers following distribution center transition issues in fiscal 2014, while the decrease in Brazil was primarily due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and comparison to strong sales related to the World Cup in fiscal 2014. On a category basis, revenues were higher in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Action Sports and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer). DTC revenues increased 51% compared to fiscal 2014, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 26%, the addition of new stores and online sales growth.The constant currency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2015 was attributable to increases in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Action Sports, the Jordan Brand and Running. Unit sales of footwear decreased 2% while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 11 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher full-price ASP reflecting price increases in response to inflationary conditions in certain Latin American countries, particularly Argentina, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced DTC business.Constant currency apparel revenue growth was due to increases in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a decline in Football (Soccer) revenues due to higher World Cup sales in fiscal 2014. Unit sales of apparel decreased 1% for fiscal 2015. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, and to a lesser extent, higher full-price ASP driven by price increases in response to inflationary conditions.On a reported basis, EBIT decreased 14% primarily due to reported revenue declines, lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense, as well as the impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Gross margin decreased 140 basis points due to unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, higher inventory obsolescence and higher off-price mix, partially offset by higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs, primarily to support DTC growth, as well as higher demand creation expense, in part as a result of support for the World Cup in early fiscal 2015 and higher sports marketing expense.Global Brand Divisions(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2014 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues $73 $115 -37 % -30 % $125 -8 % -2 %(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes $(2,596) $(2,267) 15 % $(1,993) 14 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Revenues for Global Brand Divisions are primarily attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased $329 million for fiscal 2016 due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense, and to a lesser extent, lower revenues, largely resulting from the expiration of certain football club endorsement agreements. Operating overhead increased due to investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expenses. Demand creation expense increased due to higher advertising and digital brand marketing expenses.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased $274 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher operating overhead reflecting continued investments in operational infrastructure, including digital capabilities, consumer engagement and supply chain initiatives, as well as higher performance-based compensation. Demand creation expense increased slightly due to support for the World Cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and key brand and consumer events.33Table of ContentsConverse(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2014 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues $1,955 $1,982 -1 % 2% $1,684 18% 21%Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $487 $517 -6 % $496 4% In territories we define as “direct distribution markets” Converse designs, markets and sells products directly to distributors, wholesale customers and to consumers through DTC operations. The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Converse revenues increased 2% for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e. markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) grew 4%, contributing approximately 3 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of direct distribution market revenue growth. On a territory basis, growth in the United States and Asia Pacific was partially offset by declines in Europe, primarily the United Kingdom. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution markets had an insignificant impact on total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 15% for fiscal 2016, reducing total Converse revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues was primarily due to poor macroeconomic conditions in Latin America.Reported EBIT for Converse decreased 6% for fiscal 2016 as a decrease in reported revenues and lower gross margin more than offset selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin declined 220 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, shifts in mix to higher-cost products and higher off-price mix more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense declined faster than reported revenues primarily due to lower demand creation, which more than offset slightly higher operating overhead due to investments in infrastructure to support growth.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Converse increased 21% for fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 14%, contributing 12 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2015. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of Converse comparable direct distribution market revenue growth. The United States market was the most significant contributor to the growth of comparable direct distribution markets due to volume increases with key wholesale customers and expansion of our DTC business. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 8 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2015, driven by conversion of several European markets, most significantly AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland). Revenues from comparable licensed markets increased 8% for fiscal 2015, contributing 1 percentage point of total Converse revenue growth.EBIT for Converse increased 4% for fiscal 2015 as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased 60 basis points primarily due to transitions of licensed markets to direct distribution markets. Selling and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher operating overhead costs resulting from investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, including market transitions, new systems and new headquarters, as well as higher intellectual property enforcement costs.Corporate(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change Fiscal 2014 % ChangeRevenues $(86) $(82) — $3 —(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes $(1,173) $(1,097) 7% $(1,036) 6%Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.34Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 For fiscal 2016, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $76 million primarily due to the following:•an increase of $179 million, primarily driven by higher operating overhead expense to support corporate growth initiatives;•a beneficial change of $76 million from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these gains are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and•a beneficial change of $27 million in net foreign currency gains related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net.Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 For fiscal 2015, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $61 million primarily due to the following:•a $203 million increase, primarily in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support growth of the business as well as higher performance-based compensation;•a $144 million beneficial change from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains, reported as a component of Other (income) expense, net; and•an approximate $2 million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin.Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging PracticesOverviewAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (""NTC"") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Transactional ExposuresWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.35Table of Contents2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.Managing Transactional ExposuresTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below.Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.Translational ExposuresMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,985 million and $1,171 million for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $449 million and $221 million for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Managing Translational ExposuresTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 36Table of ContentsRefer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $423 million and $73 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Net Investments in Foreign SubsidiariesWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for net investment hedges. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2016 and 2015. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow ActivityCash provided by operations was $3,096 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $4,680 million for fiscal 2015. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2016 was Net income of $3,760 million. Our fiscal 2016 change in working capital was a net cash outflow of $1,580 million as compared to a net cash inflow of $256 million for fiscal 2015. The change in working capital was primarily due to a net decrease in the amount of cash collateral received as a result of hedging activities (refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail). For fiscal 2016, cash collateral received from counterparties declined $863 million as compared to an increase in collateral received from counterparties of $968 million for fiscal 2015.Cash used by investing activities was $1,034 million for fiscal 2016, compared to a $175 million use of cash for fiscal 2015. The primary driver of the increase in Cash used by investing activities was the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) from net sales/maturities to net purchases. In fiscal 2016, there were $57 million of net purchases of short-term investments compared to $935 million of net sales/maturities of short-term investments in the same period of fiscal 2015. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $1,143 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to $963 million for fiscal 2015. The increase in Additions to property, plant and equipment resulted from continued investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, primarily relating to supply chain and corporate initiatives, as well as expansion of our DTC operations.In fiscal 2017, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, as well as expand our digital capabilities. We anticipate investing approximately 4% of revenue, a portion of which will be used for the continued expansion of our corporate facilities, new DTC stores and digital capabilities.Cash used by financing activities was $2,671 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $2,790 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of $119 million, as increases in share repurchases and dividends were more than offset by the receipt of $981 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in October 2015.In fiscal 2016, we purchased 55.4 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $3,238 million (an average price of $58.44). During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we concluded the Company's four-year, $8 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2012. Under this program the Company purchased a total of 197.1 million shares at a cost of $8 billion (an average price of $40.58 per share). Following the completion of this program, the Company began purchases under a four-year, $12 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in November 2015. Of the total 55.4 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2016, 20.1 million shares were purchased under this new program at a cost of approximately $1,189 million (an average price of $59.21 per share). We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.Capital ResourcesOn April 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the ""Shelf"") with the SEC which permitted us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. On April 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2023. The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on May 1, 2043. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. On October 29, 2015, we issued an additional $1.0 billion of senior notes at a 3.875% fixed, annual interest rate that will mature on November 1, 2045. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $991 million. The Shelf expired on April 23, 2016. We plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2016.On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on November 1, 2011, which would have matured November 1, 2017. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility.37Table of ContentsWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2016, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program, which increased $1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During the year ended May 31, 2016, we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. Any future issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.As of May 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.5 billion, of which $4.6 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Included in Cash and equivalents as of May 31, 2016 was $105 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity. Cash equivalents and Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2016, the weighted average remaining duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 91 days.To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.38Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2016 and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,(In millions) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter TotalOperating Leases $491 $453 $395 $347 $301 $1,244 $3,231Capital Leases 7 5 2 1 — — 15Long-Term Debt(1) 115 75 74 74 71 3,365 3,774Endorsement Contracts(2) 1,198 1,238 945 827 698 4,514 9,420Product Purchase Obligations(3) 4,149 — — — — — 4,149Other Purchase Obligations(4) 384 118 90 48 42 90 772TOTAL $6,344 $1,889 $1,506 $1,297 $1,112 $9,213 $21,361(1)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2016 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(2)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(3)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and e-commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.(4)Other purchase obligations primarily include service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2016. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.

These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. Critical Accounting PoliciesOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.39Table of ContentsWe believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters.Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.Revenue RecognitionWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.Inventory ReservesWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement ContractsA significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term.40Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived AssetsProperty, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value.We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Fair Value MeasurementsFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as time deposits, commercial paper and bonds, U.S. Agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include a comparison to another independent pricing vendor.41Table of ContentsHedge Accounting for DerivativesWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.We have used in the past, and may use in the future, forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income within Total shareholders’ equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as Other (income) expense, net during the period in which changes occur.Stock-based CompensationWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.Income TaxesWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination.On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.42Table of ContentsOther ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.43Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2016 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. See section “Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, fixed-rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed-rate debt, as well as pay-fixed, receive-variable forward-starting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments on future debt.Market Risk MeasurementWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $109 million and $117 million at May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The VaR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio at May 31, 2016. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $209 million and $205 million during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.During the year ended May 31, 2016, we entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. A forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. We entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates.Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. 44Table of Contents Expected Maturity DateYear Ending May 31,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Fair ValueForeign Exchange Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $6 $6 $6 $6 $3 $— $27 $28Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 0.0% 2.4% Interest Rate Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $6 $6 $6 $6 $3 $— $27 $28Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 0.0% 2.4% U.S. Dollar Functional Currency Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $38 $— $— $— $— $2,000 $2,038 $2,097Average interest rate 6.2% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 3.4% 3.5% Anticipated long-term U.S. Dollar debt issuance - Floating rate swapped to fixed rate Notional(1) $1,500 $— $— $— $— $— $1,500 $38Weighted-average fixed rate 2.2% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.2% Weighted-average floating rate 0.7% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.7% (1) Forward-starting interest rate swaps have been included in the maturities category based on when the related forecasted debt issuance and corresponding swap terminations are expected to occur.The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2017,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned in-line and factory retail stores and NIKE-owned internet websites and mobile applications (which we refer to collectively as our “Direct to Consumer” or “DTC” operations), and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail, online and through mobile applications.In June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveraging the power of digital, NIKE will drive growth — by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections.In addition to achieving long-term, sustainable revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas:•Expanding gross margin by:- Delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value equation for consumers;- Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation;- Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market; and- Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business, led by digital commerce, as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations.•Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on:- Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit;- Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and- Investments in key areas of future growth, including our DTC business.•Managing working capital efficiency; and•Deploying capital effectively.Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows:•High single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth;•Mid-teens earnings per share growth;•High-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital; •Free cash flow growing faster than net income; and•Sustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses.Over the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. During this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE, Inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. We expanded gross margin by approximately 70 basis points, and our return on invested capital has increased from 21.9% to 34.7%.On November 19, 2015, we announced a two-for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.Our fiscal 2017 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability. Despite foreign currency headwinds, we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 6% to $34.4 billion, Net income increased 13% and diluted earnings per common share grew 16% to $2.51. We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth.Earnings before interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) increased 7% for fiscal 2017, driven by revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset by gross margin contraction. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse, footwear and apparel, and several key categories. This broad-based growth was primarily fueled by:•Innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air, Free, Zoom, Lunar, Flywire, Dri-Fit and Flyknit; •Deep brand connections with consumers through our category offense, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; and•Strong category retail presentation through digital commerce and NIKE-owned and retail partner stores. NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 160 basis points primarily due to higher product costs and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which more than offset higher full-price average selling price (ASP). At current rates, we anticipate foreign currency exchange rate headwinds will continue to negatively impact gross margin and Net income in fiscal 2018.21Table of ContentsConverse revenues increased 4% and EBIT declined 2%, as growth in direct distribution markets and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by lower gross margin, primarily a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs, as well as the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues primarily due to market transitions.For fiscal 2017, the growth in Net income was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 550 basis points primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States. Diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than Net income due to a 3% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no Direct to Consumer operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations, which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company’s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change Fiscal 2015 % ChangeRevenues $34,350 $32,376 6 % $30,601 6 %Cost of sales 19,038 17,405 9 % 16,534 5 %Gross profit 15,312 14,971 2 % 14,067 6 %Gross margin 44.6% 46.2% 46.0% Demand creation expense 3,341 3,278 2 % 3,213 2 %Operating overhead expense 7,222 7,191 0 % 6,679 8 %Total selling and administrative expense 10,563 10,469 1 % 9,892 6 %% of revenues 30.8% 32.3% 32.3% Interest expense (income), net 59 19 — 28 —Other (income) expense, net (196) (140) — (58) —Income before income taxes 4,886 4,623 6 % 4,205 10 %Income tax expense 646 863 -25 % 932 -7 %Effective tax rate 13.2% 18.7% 22.2% NET INCOME $4,240 $3,760 13 % $3,273 15 %Diluted earnings per common share $2.51 $2.16 16 % $1.85 17 %22Table of ContentsConsolidated Operating ResultsRevenues(Dollars in millions)Fiscal 2017Fiscal 2016(1)% Change% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)Fiscal 2015(1)% Change% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)NIKE, Inc.

Revenues grew 8% for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand and Converse. All NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2017 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers online and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based as Greater China, Western Europe, Emerging Markets and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 3%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in several key categories, most notably Sportswear, Men’s Training and Running. Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced DTC business.While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to expand our DTC businesses in each of our geographies. Our NIKE Brand DTC operations include NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as NIKE-owned digital commerce. For fiscal 2017, DTC revenues represented approximately 28% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2017, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 30%, the addition of new stores and 7% comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales through NIKE-owned websites and mobile applications, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and represented approximately 24% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to 22% for fiscal 2016.On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 6%, driven by significant growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, while Women's revenues increased 8%, led by growth in Sportswear and Running. Revenues for our Young Athletes' business increased 8%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 12% for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by higher revenues for the NIKE Brand. Every NIKE Brand geography grew revenues for fiscal 2016. North America contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues, while Greater China and Western Europe each contributed approximately 3 percentage points, Emerging Markets contributed approximately 2 percentage points and Central & Eastern Europe contributed approximately 1 percentage point. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 15% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 2%. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including strong growth in Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 9%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher full-price ASP, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business. The constant-currency increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Men’s Training, Running, Women’s Training and Football (Soccer). Apparel unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in our higher-priced DTC business.For fiscal 2016, DTC revenues represented approximately 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 23% in fiscal 2015. On a currency-neutral basis, DTC revenues increased 25% for fiscal 2016, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 10%. Digital commerce sales through NIKE-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 51% in fiscal 2016. Digital commerce sales grew 59% in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, digital commerce sales represented approximately 22% of our total NIKE Brand DTC revenues compared to 18% for fiscal 2015.On a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fiscal 2016 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 11%, driven by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, while Women’s revenues increased 17%, led by Sportswear, Running and Women’s Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes’ business increased 11%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.24Table of ContentsFutures OrdersFutures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 totaled $14.7 billion, 2% lower than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. NIKE Brand futures orders include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. The U.S. Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. By geography, futures orders were as follows: Reported Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes(1)North America -10 % -10 %Western Europe 1 % 3 %Central & Eastern Europe -3 % -1 %Greater China 7 % 12 %Japan -7 % 3 %Emerging Markets 9 % 12 %TOTAL NIKE BRAND FUTURES ORDERS -2 % 0 %(1)Futures orders have been calculated using prior year exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. A portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales with short lead times, closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, all sales of NIKE Brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations, and sales from Converse, NIKE Golf and Hurley.Gross Margin(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change Fiscal 2015 % ChangeGross profit $15,312 $14,971 2% $14,067 6%Gross margin 44.6% 46.2% (160) bps 46.0% 20 bpsFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016For fiscal 2017, our consolidated gross margin was 160 basis points lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the following factors:•Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products to the consumer;•Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 100 basis points) as an increase in the mix of higher cost products and labor input cost inflation more than offset lower material input costs;•Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points); and•Lower NIKE Brand DTC margins (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points) reflecting the impact of higher off-price sales.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 For fiscal 2016, our consolidated gross margin was 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015, primarily attributable to the following factors:•Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, (increasing gross margin approximately 190 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products with higher prices and, to a lesser extent, due to price increases reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories;•Growth in our higher-margin DTC business (increasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points);•Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) as shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation were only partially offset by lower material input costs;•Higher off-price mix (decreasing gross margin approximately 30 basis points), primarily reflecting the impacts from clearing excess inventory in North America;•Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedges, (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points); •Higher other costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily due to higher product design and development costs; and•Lower gross margin from Converse (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points), primarily resulting from shifts in mix to lower-margin products.25Table of ContentsTotal Selling and Administrative Expense(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change Fiscal 2015 % ChangeDemand creation expense(1) $3,341 $3,278 2% $3,213 2%Operating overhead expense 7,222 7,191 0% 6,679 8%Total selling and administrative expense $10,563 $10,469 1% $9,892 6%% of revenues 30.8% 32.3% (150) bps 32.3% —(1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016Demand creation expense increased 2% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, driven by higher sports marketing costs, as well as higher marketing and advertising costs, primarily to support key sporting events including the Rio Olympics and European Football Championship. These increases were partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point.Operating overhead expense was flat compared to fiscal 2016 as continued investments in our growing DTC business were offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2017.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Demand creation expense increased 2% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to investments in digital brand marketing, including for our DTC business, as well as support for key brand events and initiatives, and sports marketing investments, partially offset by lower advertising expense. For fiscal 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Demand creation expense by approximately 6 percentage points.Operating overhead expense increased 8% compared to fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of continued investments in our DTC business, including new store openings and higher variable expenses, as well as higher wage-related expenses and investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in Operating overhead expense by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2016.Other (Income) Expense, Net(In millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015Other (income) expense, net $(196) $(140) $(58)Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Other (income) expense, net increased from $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016 to $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $59 million for fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Other (income) expense, net increased from $58 million of other income, net for fiscal 2015 to $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016, driven by a $26 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, a favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case in Western Europe and net gains from other non-operating items. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $423 million for fiscal 2016.Income Taxes Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change Fiscal 2015 % ChangeEffective tax rate 13.2% 18.7% (550) bps 22.2% (350) bpsFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 The 550 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States.26Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 The 350 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the United States, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Operating SegmentsOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan and Emerging Markets, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company’s NIKE Brand DTC operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.The breakdown of revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(1) Fiscal 2015 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(1)North America $15,216 $14,764 3% 3% $13,740 7 % 8 %Western Europe 6,211 5,884 6% 11% 5,705 3 % 14 %Central & Eastern Europe 1,487 1,431 4% 7% 1,421 1 % 17 %Greater China 4,237 3,785 12% 17% 3,067 23 % 27 %Japan 1,014 869 17% 7% 755 15 % 22 %Emerging Markets 3,995 3,701 8% 14% 3,898 -5 % 13 %Global Brand Divisions(2) 73 73 0% 2% 115 -37 % -30 %Total NIKE Brand Revenues 32,233 30,507 6% 8% 28,701 6 % 13 %Converse 2,042 1,955 4% 6% 1,982 -1 % 2 %Corporate(3) 75 (86) — — (82) — —TOTAL NIKE, INC.

DTC revenues increased 9% for fiscal 2017 due to digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 3%. The broader retail marketplace in North America is being impacted by several significant trends, including shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels, retail consolidation and a promotional environment.Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while ASP per pair was flat as higher off-price ASP was offset by unfavorable off-price mix.The increase in apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was due to growth concentrated in Sportswear, partially offset by declines in several other categories. Unit sales of apparel grew 2% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP.EBIT grew 3% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin increased 10 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable off-price margin more than offset higher product costs and increased off-price mix as a result of clearing excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our DTC business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead as continued investments in our growing DTC business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail brand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 On a constant-currency basis, North America revenues increased 8% primarily due to growth in our Sportswear, Jordan Brand and Running categories. DTC revenues grew 17% for fiscal 2016, fueled by strong digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 6%.28Table of ContentsCurrency-neutral footwear revenue growth was attributable to higher revenues in most key categories, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Running and Women's Training, partially offset by a slight decline in NIKE Basketball. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 8%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business, partially offset by higher off-price mix.Apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by our Sportswear and Men's Training categories. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of apparel grew 7%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP. EBIT increased 3% for fiscal 2016 as higher revenues were largely offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin declined 80 basis points as higher off-price mix, higher warehousing and inventory obsolescence costs, as well as higher product input costs more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead to support our growing DTC operations and bad debt expense related to customer bankruptcies was partially offset by lower variable compensation. Demand creation also grew at a faster rate than revenues due to higher spending for sports marketing, DTC marketing and key brand events and initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising expense.Western Europe(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2015 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $4,068 $3,985 2 % 7% $3,876 3 % 14%Apparel 1,868 1,628 15 % 21% 1,552 5 % 16%Equipment 275 271 1 % 7% 277 -2 % 8%TOTAL REVENUES $6,211 $5,884 6 % 11% $5,705 3 % 14%Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $4,443 $4,429 0 % 5% $4,451 0 % 10%Sales Direct to Consumer 1,768 1,455 22 % 28% 1,254 16 % 28%TOTAL REVENUES $6,211 $5,884 6 % 11% $5,705 3 % 14%EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $1,203 $1,434 -16 % $1,275 12 % Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 On a currency-neutral basis, Western Europe revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 11%.

DTC revenues grew 28% for fiscal 2017 due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 16% and the addition of new stores.The constant-currency increase in footwear revenues was led by Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, partially offset by declines concentrated in Football (Soccer). For fiscal 2017, unit sales of footwear increased 5% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business.Currency-neutral apparel revenue growth was due to higher revenues for nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2017 increased 16%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of growth in our DTC business and higher full-price ASP.Reported EBIT decreased 16% for fiscal 2017, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by significant gross margin contraction. Gross margin declined 550 basis points primarily driven by the effects of significant unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense, as increased sports marketing and advertising expenses more than offset lower marketing costs. Operating overhead also increased due to continued investments in our growing DTC business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation costs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 On a constant-currency basis, Western Europe revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 14% with double-digit growth in every territory. Growth was led by our largest territories, the UK & Ireland and AGS (Austria, Germany and Switzerland), which grew 12% and 16%, respectively.

Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2016 increased 11%. Higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily driven by the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business and higher full-price ASP.29Table of ContentsOn a reported basis, EBIT grew 12% for fiscal 2016, despite the negative translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the Euro. EBIT grew at a higher rate than revenue as selling and administrative expense leverage and the favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case reflected in Other (income) expense, net, were only partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher off-price mix were mostly offset by higher full-price ASP, shifts in mix to lower-cost products and growth in our higher-margin DTC business. Selling and administrative expense was lower as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead, primarily to support DTC expansion. Demand creation increased slightly as higher spending for DTC and other demand creation costs more than offset lower sports marketing costs.

Unit sales of footwear increased 21%, while lower ASP per pair reduced footwear revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points as higher off-price ASP was more than offset by lower DTC ASP and unfavorable off-price mix.The currency-neutral apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was due to higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. Unit sales of apparel increased 15% and higher ASP per unit increased apparel revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points. The increase in ASP per unit was attributable to higher full-price ASP, partially offset by lower ASP in our DTC business and unfavorable off-price mix.Despite the negative impact of translation, reported EBIT increased 10% for fiscal 2017 driven by higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin contracted 240 basis points primarily due to unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead to support DTC growth. Demand creation expense also increased as higher marketing costs more than offset lower retail brand presentation and sports marketing expenses.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 On a currency-neutral basis, Greater China revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 27%, driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand.

For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 27%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.Constant-currency apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was attributable to higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by Running and Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 17% for fiscal 2016 while ASP per unit was flat.On a reported basis, EBIT increased 38% for fiscal 2016 due to strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin increased 80 basis points due to higher full-price ASP and an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by shifts in mix to higher-cost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead increased largely due to support for our growing DTC operations, while demand creation was also higher, primarily due to retail brand presentation costs to re-profile category and consumer-focused retail stores as well as spending for key brand events.31Table of ContentsJapan(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2015 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $666 $570 17% 7 % $452 26 % 34%Apparel 275 228 21% 10 % 230 -1 % 5%Equipment 73 71 3% -6 % 73 -3 % 3%TOTAL REVENUES $1,014 $869 17% 7 % $755 15 % 22%Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $668 $587 14% 4 % $536 10 % 16%Sales Direct to Consumer 346 282 23% 12 % 219 29 % 37%TOTAL REVENUES $1,014 $869 17% 7 % $755 15 % 22%EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $224 $174 29% $100 74 % Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016On a constant-currency basis, revenues for Japan increased 7% for fiscal 2017. Most key categories grew, led by Sportswear and Running, partially offset by declines in Golf. DTC revenue growth of 12% was driven by comparable store sales growth of 10%, digital commerce sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, EBIT increased 29%, in part reflecting the impact of the stronger Yen. Reported revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were only partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 150 basis points as lower product costs were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, unfavorable off-price margin and lower DTC margin. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead increased as lower wage-related, administrative and variable compensation costs were more than offset by increased investments in our growing DTC business and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Demand creation expense increased as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates more than offset lower sports marketing, advertising and marketing costs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Japan increased 22% for fiscal 2016, driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand. DTC revenues were 37% higher, due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 17% and the addition of new stores. Reported EBIT increased 74%, despite the weaker Yen. EBIT growth was driven by higher reported revenues, gross margin expansion and significant selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin expanded 270 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, in part due to lower discounts, as well as growth in our higher-margin DTC business, lower product input costs and warehousing efficiencies, which more than offset unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased as a percent of revenues despite investments in operating overhead to support our growing DTC business. Demand creation spending for DTC marketing and brand events was largely offset by lower spending for retail brand presentation and advertising costs.

Additionally, revenues increased in most key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues increased 26%, fueled by the addition of new stores, comparable store sales growth of 11% and higher digital commerce sales.The increase in constant-currency footwear revenue for fiscal 2017 was attributable to growth in most key categories, most notably Sportswear and Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 7%. Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories.Currency-neutral growth in apparel revenue was fueled by increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2017, unit sales of apparel were flat while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 8 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories. Reported EBIT decreased 9%, in part reflecting the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso and Mexican Peso. Reported revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased 430 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs primarily resulting from ongoing investments in our growing DTC business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies. Demand creation expense also increased as lower advertising costs were more than offset by increased marketing support for the Rio Olympics in the first quarter, as well as higher sports marketing costs. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2016 revenues for Emerging Markets increased 13%. Growth was attributable to higher revenues in 7 of 9 territories, led by one of our largest territories, SOCO (which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile), which grew 32%, and by Mexico and Pacific (which includes Australia and New Zealand), which grew 31% and 27%, respectively. Revenues declined 5% in Brazil, primarily reflecting on-going macroeconomic challenges. On a category basis, revenues grew in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear and Running. DTC revenues increased 23%, driven by the addition of new stores, comparable store sales growth of 7% and digital commerce sales growth.The constant-currency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2016 was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, most notably Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2016, unit sales of footwear increased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was attributable to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.The constant-currency growth in apparel revenue was due to increases in most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Women's Training. Fiscal 2016 unit sales of apparel decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 13 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was due to higher full-price ASP, primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced DTC business.On a reported basis, EBIT increased 9%, despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso, Mexican Peso and Korean Won, as gross margin expansion more than offset lower reported revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin expanded 350 basis points due to higher full-price ASP, lower warehousing and obsolescence costs, and growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by shifts in mix to higher-cost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense declined on a reported basis, but was higher as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead due to additional investments in our DTC business and higher wage-related and variable compensation expenses were more than offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Demand creation expense also increased driven by sports marketing and digital brand marketing costs, offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.Global Brand Divisions(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2015 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues $73 $73 0% 2% $115 -37 % -30 %(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes $(2,677) $(2,596) 3% $(2,267) 15 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Revenues for Global Brand Divisions are primarily attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Global Brand Divisions’ loss before interest and taxes increased 3% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher demand creation expense, which was only partially offset by a decline in operating overhead expense. The increase in demand creation expense was due to higher marketing and advertising expenses for key brand and sporting events, including the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championship in the first quarter. Operating overhead expense decreased as higher wage-related expenses were more than offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation. Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Global Brand Divisions’ loss before interest and taxes increased 15% for fiscal 2016 due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense, and to a lesser extent, lower revenues, largely resulting from the expiration of certain football club endorsement agreements. Operating overhead increased due to higher wage-related expenses and consumer-focused digital capabilities, partially offset by lower variable compensation expenses. Demand creation expense increased due to higher advertising and digital brand marketing expenses.33Table of ContentsConverse(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2015 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues $2,042 $1,955 4 % 6% $1,982 -1 % 2%Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $477 $487 -2 % $517 -6 % In territories we define as “direct distribution markets” Converse designs, markets and sells products directly to distributors and wholesale customers, and to consumers through DTC operations. The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse increased 6% for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e. markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) grew 4%, contributing approximately 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the United States, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the market transition in Italy. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5%, having an insignificant impact to total Converse revenue. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America.Reported EBIT declined 2% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products. Gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues, primarily due to market transitions. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense, primarily as a result of lower retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Operating overhead increased as higher wage-related expenses were only partially offset by lower administrative costs.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Converse revenues increased 2% for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 4%, contributing approximately 3 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of direct distribution market revenue growth. On a territory basis, growth in the United States and Asia Pacific was partially offset by declines in Europe, primarily the United Kingdom. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution markets had an insignificant impact on total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 15% for fiscal 2016, reducing total Converse revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues was primarily due to poor macroeconomic conditions in Latin America.Reported EBIT for Converse decreased 6% for fiscal 2016 as a decrease in reported revenues and lower gross margin more than offset selling and administrative expense leverage. Gross margin declined 220 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, shifts in mix to higher-cost products and higher off-price mix more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense declined faster than reported revenues primarily due to lower demand creation, which more than offset slightly higher operating overhead due to higher wage-related expenses.Corporate(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change Fiscal 2015 % ChangeRevenues $75 $(86) — $(82) —(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes $(724) $(1,173) -38 % $(1,097) 7%Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.34Table of ContentsFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 For fiscal 2017, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes decreased $449 million primarily due to the following:•a beneficial change of $280 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin;•a beneficial change of $115 million, primarily driven by lower variable compensation and administrative costs in operating overhead expense; and•an increase in net foreign currency gains of $54 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 For fiscal 2016, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $76 million primarily due to the following:•an increase of $179 million, primarily driven by higher operating overhead expense to support corporate growth initiatives;•a beneficial change of $76 million from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains; these gains are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and•a beneficial change of $27 million in net foreign currency gains related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net.Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging PracticesOverviewAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Transactional ExposuresWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.35Table of Contents2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.Managing Transactional ExposuresTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above.Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.Translational ExposuresMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $542 million and $1,985 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $115 million and $449 million for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Managing Translational ExposuresTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 36Table of ContentsRefer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $59 million and $423 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Net Investments in Foreign SubsidiariesWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2017 and 2016. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow ActivityCash provided by operations was $3,640 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $3,096 million for fiscal 2016. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $4,781 million of operating cash flow in fiscal 2017 compared to $4,676 million for fiscal 2016. Our fiscal 2017 change in working capital was a cash outflow of $1,141 million compared to an outflow of $1,580 million for fiscal 2016. The change in working capital was primarily due to the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging activities. For fiscal 2017, cash collateral received from counterparties, which is recorded in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, decreased $105 million compared to a decrease of $863 million during fiscal 2016. Refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. This decrease in cash collateral was partially offset by a $486 million increase in Accounts Receivable, net driven by higher revenues.Cash used by investing activities was $1,008 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $1,034 million for fiscal 2016, driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments and reverse repurchase agreements, as well as additions of property, plant and equipment. During fiscal 2017, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $118 million compared to an outflow of $57 million in fiscal 2016. This change was partially offset by the maturity of reverse repurchase agreements of $150 million in fiscal 2016 which did not recur in fiscal 2017. Additions of property, plant and equipment were $1,105 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $1,143 million in fiscal 2016.In fiscal 2018, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, new DTC stores, and expanding our digital capabilities. We continue to expect such investments will be approximately 4% of revenues, on average.Cash used by financing activities was $1,942 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $2,671 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by increased proceeds from the issuance of debt and commercial paper in fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher dividends and lower excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements.In fiscal 2017, we purchased 59.7 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $3,249 million (an average price of $54.43 per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2017, we had repurchased 79.8 million shares at a cost of approximately $4,437 million (an average price of $55.63 per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.Capital ResourcesOn October 21, 2016, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2026 and 2046. The 2026 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion at a 2.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2026. The 2046 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.375% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on November 1, 2046. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $1,493 million. Refer to Note 8 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on Long-term debt.On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2017, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.37Table of ContentsLiquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2017, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $919 million. As of May 31, 2017, there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2018 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.As of May 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $6.2 billion, of which $5.8 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2017, the average duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 65 days.To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.Contractual ObligationsOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2017 and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,(In millions) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter TotalOperating Leases $537 $509 $438 $399 $350 $1,672 $3,905Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations(1) 34 32 28 25 26 225 370Long-Term Debt(2) 115 115 115 112 109 5,322 5,888Endorsement Contracts(3) 1,323 1,214 1,054 889 1,032 4,338 9,850Product Purchase Obligations(4) 4,521 — — — — — 4,521Other Purchase Obligations(5) 1,000 373 182 106 75 179 1,915TOTAL $7,530 $2,243 $1,817 $1,531 $1,592 $11,736 $26,449(1)Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. (2)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2017 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(3)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(4)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our DTC in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.(5)Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.38Table of ContentsIn addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2017. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.

These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. Critical Accounting PoliciesOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters.Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.Revenue RecognitionWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.In certain countries outside of the United States, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.39Table of ContentsInventory ReservesWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement ContractsA significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term.Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived AssetsWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.Hedge Accounting for DerivativesWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.Stock-based CompensationWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.Income TaxesWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, thus reducing our overall Income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.40Table of ContentsWe carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination.On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.Other ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.41Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2017 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.Market Risk MeasurementWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $97 million and $109 million at May 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2017. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $161 million and $209 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. 42Table of Contents Expected Maturity DateYear Ending May 31,(Dollars in millions) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total Fair ValueForeign Exchange Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $6 $6 $6 $3 $— $— $21 $22Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 0.0% 0.0% 2.4% Interest Rate Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $6 $6 $6 $3 $— $— $21 $22Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 0.0% 0.0% 2.4% U.S. Dollar Functional Currency Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $— $— $— $— $— $3,500 $3,500 $3,379Average interest rate 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 3.1% 3.1% The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2018,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.In June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveraging the power of digital, NIKE plans to drive growth — by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections. As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA).Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. As a result of the execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are as follows:•High single-digit revenue growth;•Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points;•Slight selling and administrative expense leverage;•Mid-teens earnings per share growth; and•Low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital.Over the past ten years, we have achieved strong growth in many of these metrics. During this time, revenues for NIKE, Inc. have grown 7% on an annual compounded basis, annual gross margin has ranged from 43.5% to 46.4%, diluted earnings per common share has grown steadily and our return on invested capital has been as high as 34.7%.Our fiscal 2018 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, while investing in capabilities in support of our Triple Double strategy to fuel our next phase of long-term growth and profitability. We achieved record revenues for fiscal 2018, growing 6% to $36.4 billion. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, delivered 7% revenue growth. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 5%, driven by strong revenue growth across all international geographies and NIKE Direct, as well as growth in footwear, apparel and most key categories. Revenues for Converse decreased 8% and 11% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by lower revenues in North America.Income before income taxes decreased 11% for fiscal 2018, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue growth was more than offset by higher selling and administrative expense, gross margin contraction, and a shift to other expense, net from other income, net for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 80 basis points primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate headwinds. Selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues, reflecting investments in digital capabilities, consumer experiences and product and brand marketing to drive long-term growth under the Consumer Direct Offense.Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company’s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.20Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 % Change Fiscal 2016 % ChangeRevenues $36,397 $34,350 6 % $32,376 6 %Cost of sales 20,441 19,038 7 % 17,405 9 %Gross profit 15,956 15,312 4 % 14,971 2 %Gross margin 43.8% 44.6% 46.2% Demand creation expense 3,577 3,341 7 % 3,278 2 %Operating overhead expense 7,934 7,222 10 % 7,191 0 %Total selling and administrative expense 11,511 10,563 9 % 10,469 1 %% of revenues 31.6% 30.8% 32.3% Interest expense (income), net 54 59 — 19 —Other expense (income), net 66 (196) — (140) —Income before income taxes 4,325 4,886 -11 % 4,623 6 %Income tax expense 2,392 646 270 % 863 -25 %Effective tax rate 55.3% 13.2% 18.7% NET INCOME $1,933 $4,240 -54 % $3,760 13 %Diluted earnings per common share $1.17 $2.51 -53 % $2.16 16 %21Table of ContentsConsolidated Operating ResultsRevenues(Dollars in millions)Fiscal 2018Fiscal 2017(1)% Change% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)Fiscal 2016(1)% Change% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)NIKE, Inc.

Revenues grew 4% for fiscal 2018, driven by growth in the NIKE Brand. All international NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2018 as our Consumer Direct Offense delivered innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers through digital platforms and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based, as Greater China, EMEA and APLA each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues. For fiscal 2018, lower revenues from North America and Converse each reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 1 percentage point.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 4% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2018, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 4%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was due to strong growth in Sportswear and Running, which was partially offset by lower revenues in several other categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2018 increased 2% and higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2018 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, NIKE Basketball and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 4% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher ASPs from full-price, off-price and NIKE Direct sales.For fiscal 2018, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 30% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 28% for fiscal 2017. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2018, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 25%, the addition of new stores and 4% comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017, and represented approximately 27% of our total NIKE Brand NIKE Direct revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to 24% for fiscal 2017.On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 5%, as growth in Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball more than offset lower Football (Soccer) and Jordan Brand revenues. Women’s revenues increased 2%, led by growth in Sportswear, partially offset by a decline in Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes’ business decreased 1%, as growth in Football (Soccer), was more than offset by lower revenues in the Jordan Brand.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 8% for fiscal 2017, driven by higher revenues for all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse. Revenue growth was broad-based, as EMEA, Greater China, APLA and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 3%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales.The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Training. Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced NIKE Direct business.For fiscal 2017, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 28% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2017, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 30%, the addition of new stores and 7% comparable store sales growth. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and represented approximately 24% of our total NIKE Direct revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to 22% for fiscal 2016.On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 6%, driven by significant growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, while Women’s revenues increased 8%, led by growth in Sportswear and Running. Revenues for our Young Athletes’ business increased 8%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.23Table of ContentsGross Margin(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 % Change Fiscal 2016 % ChangeGross profit $15,956 $15,312 4% $14,971 2%Gross margin 43.8% 44.6% (80) bps 46.2% (160) bpsFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017For fiscal 2018, our consolidated gross margin was 80 basis points lower than fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the following factors:•Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points); •Lower NIKE Direct margin (decreasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points) reflecting higher mix of off-price sales in the first half of fiscal 2018, which was partially offset by margin expansion in the second half of fiscal 2018;•NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, which was flat for fiscal 2018 as higher discounts in the first half of fiscal 2018 were offset by higher full-price ASP in the second half of the year; and•NIKE Brand product costs, on a wholesale equivalent basis, which were flat.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 For fiscal 2017, our consolidated gross margin was 160 basis points lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the following factors:•Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis (increasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products to the consumer;•Higher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 100 basis points) as an increase in the mix of higher cost products and labor input cost inflation more than offset lower material input costs;•Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points); and•Lower NIKE Direct margins (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points) reflecting the impact of higher off-price sales.Total Selling and Administrative Expense(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 % Change Fiscal 2016 % ChangeDemand creation expense(1) $3,577 $3,341 7% $3,278 2%Operating overhead expense 7,934 7,222 10% 7,191 0%Total selling and administrative expense $11,511 $10,563 9% $10,469 1%% of revenues 31.6% 30.8% 80 bps 32.3% (150) bps(1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation.Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017Demand creation expense increased 7% for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, driven by higher sports marketing costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 3 percentage points for fiscal 2018.Operating overhead expense increased 10% compared to fiscal 2017, due to higher administrative costs, continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business and one-time wage-related costs associated with the Consumer Direct Offense organizational realignment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2018.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Demand creation expense increased 2% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, driven by higher sports marketing costs, as well as higher marketing and advertising costs, primarily to support key sporting events including the Rio Olympics and European Football Championship. These increases were partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point.Operating overhead expense was flat compared to fiscal 2016 as continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business were offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2017.Other Expense (Income), Net(In millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016Other expense (income), net $66 $(196) $(140)Other expense (income), net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions outside the normal course of business.24Table of ContentsFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Other expense (income), net changed from $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017 to $66 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2018, primarily due to a $287 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $110 million for fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Other expense (income), net increased from $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016 to $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses.We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $59 million for fiscal 2017.Income Taxes Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 % Change Fiscal 2016 % ChangeEffective tax rate 55.3% 13.2% 4,210 bps 18.7% (550) bpsFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Our effective tax rate was 55.3% for fiscal 2018, reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The impact of the Tax Act primarily reflects provisional expense of $1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and $158 million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate resulting from the Tax Act was partially offset by the tax benefit from stock-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Refer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of ASU 2016-09, and Note 9 — Income Taxes for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 The 550 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States.Operating SegmentsOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company’s internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company’s NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.25Table of ContentsThe breakdown of revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017(1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2) Fiscal 2016(1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)North America $14,855 $15,216 -2 % -2 % $14,764 3% 3%Europe, Middle East & Africa 9,242 7,970 16 % 9 % 7,568 5% 10%Greater China 5,134 4,237 21 % 18 % 3,785 12% 17%Asia Pacific & Latin America 5,166 4,737 9 % 10 % 4,317 10% 13%Global Brand Divisions(3) 88 73 21 % 12 % 73 0% 2%TOTAL NIKE BRAND 34,485 32,233 7 % 5 % 30,507 6% 8%Converse 1,886 2,042 -8 % -11 % 1,955 4% 6%Corporate(4) 26 75 — — (86) — —TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and real-time delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital. Specifically, in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. The evolution of the North America marketplace has resulted in third-party retail store closures; however, we are currently seeing stabilization and momentum building in our business, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital.Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017North America revenues decreased 2%, as growth in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories was more than offset by declines in all other categories, most notably the Jordan Brand and Running. NIKE Direct revenues increased 5% for fiscal 2018 due to digital commerce sales growth and the addition of new stores.Footwear revenues declined 4% for fiscal 2018, as lower revenues in nearly all categories, most notably the Jordan Brand, more than offset higher revenues in Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear decreased 5%, while ASP per pair contributed approximately 1 percentage point of footwear growth, driven by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Apparel revenue growth of 1% for fiscal 2018 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories, which was only partially offset by declines in nearly all other categories. Unit sales of apparel decreased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and, to a lesser extent, higher full-price ASP and favorable changes in off-price sales.EBIT declined 7% for fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as lower full-price ASP more than offset the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead expense resulting from continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business. Demand creation expense also increased, as higher sports marketing costs were only partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 North America revenues increased 3%, driven by growth in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories, including NIKE Basketball. NIKE Direct revenues increased 9% for fiscal 2017 due to digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 3%.Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while ASP per pair was flat as higher off-price ASP was offset by unfavorable off-price mix.The increase in apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was due to growth concentrated in Sportswear, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of apparel grew 2% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP.EBIT grew 3% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin increased 10 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable off-price margin more than offset higher product costs and increased off-price mix as a result of clearing excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our NIKE Direct business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead as continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail brand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs.27Table of ContentsEurope, Middle East & Africa(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes Fiscal 2016 % Change % Change Excluding Currency ChangesRevenues by: Footwear $5,875 $5,192 13% 6% $5,043 3 % 8%Apparel 2,940 2,395 23% 16% 2,149 11 % 17%Equipment 427 383 11% 6% 376 2 % 7%TOTAL REVENUES $9,242 $7,970 16% 9% $7,568 5 % 10%Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers $6,765 $5,917 14% 8% $5,869 1 % 5%Sales through NIKE Direct 2,477 2,053 21% 13% 1,699 21 % 27%TOTAL REVENUES $9,242 $7,970 16% 9% $7,568 5 % 10%EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $1,587 $1,507 5% $1,787 -16 % Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in every territory, most notably our UK & Ireland territory, which grew 21%.

The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights.Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse declined 11% for fiscal 2018. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) declined 12%, reducing total Converse revenues by approximately 11 percentage points for fiscal 2018. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 14%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the decrease in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to declines in both the United States and Europe, in part reflecting efforts to manage inventory levels in the marketplace, partially offset by revenue growth in Asia. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2018. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 14%, reducing total Converse revenues by approximately 1 percentage point, driven by lower revenues in Latin America.Reported EBIT declined 35% for fiscal 2018 driven by lower revenues, higher selling and administrative expense and, to a lesser extent, gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 100 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by higher product costs and the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Higher operating overhead expense was due to continued investment in our direct to consumer business and, to a lesser extent, higher wage-related costs, while higher demand creation expense was due to increased marketing support for initiatives to drive growth.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 On a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse increased 6% for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 4%, contributing approximately 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the United States, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the market transition in Italy. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5%, having an insignificant impact to total Converse revenue. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America.31Table of ContentsReported EBIT declined 2% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs, primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products. Gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues, primarily due to market transitions.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.32Table of ContentsRefer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.Transactional ExposuresWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our EMEA geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations.Managing Transactional ExposuresTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above.Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. 33Table of ContentsTranslational ExposuresMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $832 million and a detriment of approximately $542 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $177 million and a detriment of approximately $115 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we anticipate the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment will change from the local currency to U.S. Dollars as the subsidiary will be operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, its non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities will now be subject to re-measurement and recorded in Other expense (income), net, within the Consolidated Statements of Income beginning in fiscal 2019. Although we continue to evaluate the impact, at current rates, we do not anticipate the re-measurement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.Managing Translational ExposuresTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $110 million and $59 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Net Investments in Foreign SubsidiariesWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2018 and 2017. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow ActivityCash provided by operations was $4,955 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $3,846 million for fiscal 2017. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,473 million of operating cash flow for fiscal 2018 compared to $4,781 million for fiscal 2017. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of $1,482 million for fiscal 2018, compared to a decrease of $935 million for fiscal 2017. Impacting the change in working capital during fiscal 2018 was the accrual of $1,172 million for the transition tax under the Tax Act, which will be paid in cash over an eight-year period. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes for additional information on the Tax Act. Cash provided by operations was also impacted by the change in Accounts Receivable, net, which decreased $187 million, primarily due to improved collection timing, compared to an increase of $426 million in fiscal 2017.Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $276 million for fiscal 2018, compared to an outflow of $1,008 million for fiscal 2017, driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2018, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $1,326 million compared to an inflow of $118 million in fiscal 2017.In fiscal 2019, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Direct stores. We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3% to 4% of revenues, on average.Cash used by financing activities was $4,835 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2,148 million for fiscal 2017. The increase in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by $1,482 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017, which did not recur in fiscal 2018. The increase in Cash used by financing activities was also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock, which resulted in a cash outflow of $4,254 million for fiscal 2018 compared to an outflow of $3,223 million for fiscal 2017.In fiscal 2018, we purchased 69.7 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $4,267 million (an average price of $61.25 per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2018, we had repurchased 149.4 million shares at a cost of $8,704 million (an average price of $58.25 per share) under this program. Although the timing and number of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions, we currently anticipate completing this program during fiscal 2019. In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new four-year, $15 billion program to repurchase shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock, which we anticipate will commence at the completion of our current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt.34Table of ContentsCapital ResourcesOn July 21, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 21, 2019. For additional detail refer to Note 8 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2018, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2018, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $1.4 billion. As of May 31, 2018, there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2019 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively.To date, in fiscal 2018, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.As of May 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.2 billion, primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2018, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 33 days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.35Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2018, and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,(In millions) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter TotalOperating Leases $589 $523 $472 $412 $361 $1,608 $3,965Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations(1) 44 37 40 38 36 229 424Long-Term Debt(2) 115 115 112 109 609 4,713 5,773Endorsement Contracts(3) 1,391 1,306 1,158 1,266 942 4,438 10,501Product Purchase Obligations(4) 4,566 — — — — — 4,566Other Purchase Obligations(5) 1,437 512 281 92 70 254 2,646Transition Tax Related to the Tax Act(6) 94 94 94 94 94 702 1,172TOTAL $8,236 $2,587 $2,157 $2,011 $2,112 $11,944 $29,047(1)Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. (2)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2018 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(3)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(4)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our NIKE Direct in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.(5)Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.(6)Represents a provisional estimate of the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we expect to utilize. Actual amounts could vary as we complete our analysis of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information.In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2018. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.

These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. 36Table of ContentsCritical Accounting PoliciesOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.These policies require we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.Revenue RecognitionWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.In certain countries, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.Inventory ReservesWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. Contingent Payments under Endorsement ContractsA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser’s performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.37Table of ContentsCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term.Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived AssetsWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.Hedge Accounting for DerivativesWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other expense (income), net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.Stock-based CompensationWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.Income TaxesWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changes previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes. In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), we recorded provisional amounts, which represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which the analysis is not yet complete. As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing and analyzing necessary information, performing and refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS), U.S. Treasury Department, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company’s accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.38Table of ContentsOther ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.39Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2018 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.Market Risk MeasurementWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $93 million and $97 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2018. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $260 million and $161 million during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. 40Table of Contents Expected Maturity DateYear Ending May 31,(Dollars in millions) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Fair ValueForeign Exchange Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $6 $6 $3 $— $— $— $15 $16Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.4% Interest Rate Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $6 $6 $3 $— $— $— $15 $16Average interest rate 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.4% U.S. Dollar Functional Currency Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $— $— $— $— $500 $3,000 $3,500 $3,279Average interest rate 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 2.3% 3.3% 3.1% The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2019,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. As a result of the execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are as follows:•High single-digit revenue growth;•Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points;•Slight selling and administrative expense leverage;•Mid-teens earnings per share growth; and•Low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital.Fiscal 2019 was our first full year executing against our new strategy and our results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, while investing in capabilities to fuel our next phase of long-term growth and profitability. We achieved record revenues in fiscal 2019, growing 7% to $39.1 billion. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, delivered 8% revenue growth fueled by investments in innovative products and digital platforms. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 11%, driven by growth across all geographies, NIKE Direct and wholesale, nearly all key categories and double-digit growth across footwear and apparel. Within our NIKE Direct business, digital outpaced all other channels, growing at 35% in fiscal 2019. Revenues for Converse increased 1% and 3% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Asia and digital, which was partially offset by declines in the U.S. and Europe.Income before income taxes increased 11% for fiscal 2019, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. NIKE, Inc. gross margin increased 90 basis points primarily due to higher full-price average selling price (ASP), on a wholesale equivalent basis, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and growth in NIKE Direct. These benefits were partially offset by higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues, reflecting investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation. Additionally, we prioritized investments in global brand campaigns aimed at deepening our connection with consumers.Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.While foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.24 NIKE, INC.Table of ContentsFor discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 25, 2018.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.2019 FORM 10-K 25Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS(Dollars in millions, except per share data)FISCAL 2019FISCAL 2018(1)% CHANGEFISCAL 2017% CHANGERevenues$39,117$36,3977 %$34,3506 %Cost of sales21,64320,4416 %19,0387 %Gross profit17,47415,95610 %15,3124 %Gross margin44.7%43.8% 44.6%Demand creation expense3,7533,5775 %3,3417 %Operating overhead expense8,9497,93413 %7,22210 %Total selling and administrative expense12,70211,51110 %10,5639 %% of revenues32.5%31.6% 30.8%Interest expense (income), net4954—59—Other (income) expense, net(78)66—(196)—Income before income taxes4,8014,32511 %4,886-11 %Income tax expense7722,392-68 %646270 %Effective tax rate16.1%55.3% 13.2%NET INCOME$4,029$1,933108 %$4,240-54 %Diluted earnings per common share$2.49$1.17113 %$2.51-53 %(1)Fiscal 2018 reflects the impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Revenues grew 11% for fiscal 2019, driven by growth in both the NIKE Brand and Converse. All NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2019 as our Consumer Direct Offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers through NIKE.com and related mobile applications, digital partner platforms, NIKE-owned and partner stores, as well as through our wholesale customers. Revenue growth was broad-based as Greater China, North America and EMEA each contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, with APLA contributing approximately 2 percentage points of growth.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2019, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues grew 4%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, the Jordan Brand and Running. Unit sales of footwear increased 8% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs. The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2019 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 6% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP.On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 32% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2019 compared to 30% for fiscal 2018. Digital commerce sales were $3.8 billion for fiscal 2019 compared to $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2019, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 35%, comparable store sales growth of 6% and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude digital commerce sales, comprises revenue from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year.On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand Men's and Women's revenues increased 10% and 11%, respectively, both driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear. During fiscal 2019, the growth in Women's was fueled by our focus on compelling design, creating female-focused brand campaigns globally and a shift towards digital-led distribution. Revenues for our NIKE Kids' business increased 11%, as all key categories, except Football (Soccer), experienced growth.28 NIKE, INC.Table of ContentsGROSS MARGINFISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018For fiscal 2019, our consolidated gross profit increased 10% to $17,474 million compared to $15,956 million for fiscal 2018. Gross margin increased 90 basis points to 44.7% for fiscal 2019 compared to 43.8% for fiscal 2018 due to the following:*Wholesale equivalentHigher NIKE Brand product costs are primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products and an increase in labor rates compared to fiscal 2018. Additionally, gross margin was favorably impacted by growth in our higher-margin NIKE Direct business.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2019.Operating overhead expense increased 13% for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, driven primarily by higher wage-related and administrative expenses, which reflect critical investments in innovation, data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation.

We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $97 million for fiscal 2019. 2019 FORM 10-K 29Table of ContentsINCOME TAXES FISCAL 2019FISCAL 2018% CHANGEFISCAL 2017% CHANGEEffective tax rate16.1%55.3%(3,920) bps13.2%4,210 bpsFISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 Our effective tax rate was 16.1% for fiscal 2019, compared to 55.3% for fiscal 2018 due to significant changes related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in the prior year and a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory rate to 21% in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in U.S. tax on foreign earnings due to the impact of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI).Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.OPERATING SEGMENTSOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company, and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.The breakdown of revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2019FISCAL 2018% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)FISCAL 2017% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)North America$15,902$14,8557 %7 %$15,216-2 %-2 %Europe, Middle East & Africa9,8129,2426 %11 %7,97016 %9 %Greater China6,2085,13421 %24 %4,23721 %18 %Asia Pacific & Latin America5,2545,1662 %13 %4,7379 %10 %Global Brand Divisions(2)4288-52 %-53 %7321 %12 %TOTAL NIKE BRAND37,21834,4858 %11 %32,2337 %5 %Converse1,9061,8861 %3 %2,042-8 %-11 %Corporate(3)(7)26——75——TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-brand experiences in NIKE Direct. Specifically, in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. The evolution of the North America marketplace is resulting in third-party retail store closures; however, we are currently seeing stabilization and momentum building with our strategic wholesale customers, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital.FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues increased 7%, driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear. NIKE Direct revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2019 as strong digital commerce sales growth of 29% and the addition of new stores more than offset a 3% decline in comparable store sales. The decline in comparable store sales was primarily due to higher sales in NIKE Brand in-line stores being more than offset by declines in NIKE Brand Factory Stores (""NFS""), as growth in our full-price channel has impacted the availability and composition of off-price inventory for sale within NFS.2019 FORM 10-K 31Table of ContentsFootwear revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal 2019, driven by growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear.

Unit sales of footwear increased 6% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.Currency-neutral apparel revenues grew 15% for fiscal 2019, driven by higher revenues in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, followed by Training. Unit sales of apparel increased 7% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 8 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.Reported EBIT increased 11% for fiscal 2019 due to revenue growth, gross margin expansion and slightly lower selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased 170 basis points as higher full-price ASP, as well as the favorable impact of growth and margin expansion in our NIKE Direct business, more than offset higher product costs. Demand creation expense decreased slightly as higher retail brand presentation and sports marketing costs were more than offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso (ARS) and Brazilian Real (BRL). Operating overhead expense decreased slightly as higher wage-related and administrative costs in our NIKE Direct operations were more than offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the ARS and BRL.GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2019FISCAL 2018% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2017% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues$42$88-52 %-53 %$7321%12%Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes$(3,262)$(2,658)-23 % $(2,677)1% Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expense, including product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.

Operating overhead expense growth was primarily driven by higher wage-related and administrative costs resulting from investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and our initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool, all of which are in an effort to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation. Lower demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing costs.CONVERSE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2019FISCAL 2018% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2017% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues$1,906$1,8861 %3%$2,042-8 %-11 %Earnings Before Interest and Taxes$303$310-2 % $477-35 % 34 NIKE, INC.Table of ContentsIn territories we define as “direct distribution markets,” Converse designs, markets and sells products directly to distributors, wholesale customers and to consumers through direct to consumer operations. The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights.FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 3% for fiscal 2019. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) increased 2%, which drove the majority of total Converse revenue growth. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 3% for fiscal 2019, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution markets revenues for the year was primarily attributable to revenue growth in Asia across all distribution channels, partially offset by lower revenues in the U.S. and Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution had minimal impact on total Converse revenues for fiscal 2019. Revenues from comparable licensed markets grew 6% for fiscal 2019, primarily due to revenue growth in Asia and Brazil, but had minimal impact on total Converse revenue growth.Reported EBIT for Converse decreased 2% for fiscal 2019 as higher selling and administrative expense more than offset gross margin expansion and revenue growth. Gross margin increased 180 basis points, driven by higher margin in our direct to consumer business, favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher full-price ASP due to changes in product mix. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and higher demand creation expense. Higher operating overhead expense was due to an increase in wage-related and administrative costs, primarily to support investments in our digital business. Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing costs associated with our digital platform.CORPORATE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2019FISCAL 2018% CHANGEFISCAL 2017% CHANGERevenues$(7)$26—$75—Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes$(1,810)$(1,456)-24 %$(724)-101 %Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.The Corporate loss before interest and taxes largely consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 For fiscal 2019, Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $354 million primarily due to the following:•an unfavorable change of $276 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin;•an unfavorable change of $210 million, primarily due to higher operating overhead expense driven by higher wage-related and administrative costs; and•a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $132 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net.2019 FORM 10-K 35Table of ContentsFOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICESOVERVIEWAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.36 NIKE, INC.Table of Contents•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,236 million, a benefit of approximately $832 million and a detriment of approximately $542 million for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $233 million, a benefit of approximately $177 million and a detriment of approximately $115 million for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the period ended May 31, 2019, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates.MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 2019 FORM 10-K 37Table of ContentsWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $97 million, $110 million and $59 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIESWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2019 and 2018. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOW ACTIVITYCash provided by operations was $5,903 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $4,955 million for fiscal 2018. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $5,341 million of operating cash flow for fiscal 2019 compared to $3,473 million for fiscal 2018. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided by operations of $562 million for fiscal 2019, compared to an increase to Cash provided by operations of $1,482 million for fiscal 2018. The primary driver of the change in working capital relates to the accrual of $1,172 million for the transition tax under the Tax Act during fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes for additional information on the Tax Act. Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2019 was further impacted by the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging transactions. During fiscal 2019, we received cash collateral of $266 million compared to $23 million in fiscal 2018. In addition, the change in Accounts receivable, net, decreased Cash provided by operations by $457 million in fiscal 2019, primarily driven by revenue growth.Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $264 million for fiscal 2019, compared to an inflow of $276 million for fiscal 2018, driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2019, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $850 million compared to an inflow of $1,326 million in fiscal 2018.In fiscal 2020, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Direct stores. We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3% to 4% of revenues, on average.Cash used by financing activities was $5,293 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $4,835 million for fiscal 2018 with the increase primarily impacted by the repayment of Notes payable during fiscal 2019.In fiscal 2019, we purchased 54.3 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $4,283 million (an average price of $78.86 per share). During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we concluded the four-year, $12 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2015. Throughout this program we purchased a total of 192.1 million shares for $12 billion (an average price of $62.47 per share). Immediately following the completion of this program, we began repurchasing shares under the new four-year, $15 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2019, we had repurchased 11.6 million shares at a cost of $986 million (an average price of $84.72 per share) under this new program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.CAPITAL RESOURCESOn July 21, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expired on July 21, 2019 and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2019. For additional information regarding our long-term debt refer to Note 8 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.38 NIKE, INC.Table of ContentsOn August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2019, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. On June 1, 2018, we repaid $325 million and had no additional borrowings under this program as of and for the year ended May 31, 2019. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.To date, in fiscal 2019, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.As of May 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $4.7 billion, primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2019, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 32 days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2019, and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:DESCRIPTION OF COMMITMENTCASH PAYMENTS DUE DURING THE YEAR ENDING MAY 31,(Dollars in millions)20202021202220232024THEREAFTERTOTALOperating Leases$553$513$441$386$345$1,494$3,732Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations (1)3234403734197374Long-Term Debt (2)115112109609984,6175,660Endorsement Contracts (3)1,3821,2741,3601,0779684,14810,209Product Purchase Obligations (4)5,203—————5,203Other Purchase Obligations (5)1,3314112251661354922,760Transition Tax Related to the Tax Act (6)86868686161483988TOTAL$8,702$2,430$2,261$2,361$1,741$11,431$28,926(1)Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements. 2019 FORM 10-K 39Table of Contents(2)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2019 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(3)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(4)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our NIKE Direct in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.(5)Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.(6)Represents the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2019.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.40 NIKE, INC.Table of ContentsThese policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of a given date. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.REVENUE RECOGNITIONOn June 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies. Our revenue recognition polices under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605 — Revenue Recognition, are included below in the event they are substantially different.Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. Prior to June 1, 2018, the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.As part of our revenue recognition policy, consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to June 1, 2018, the Company's reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within Accounts receivable, net for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for our direct to consumer business, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.Refer also to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 — Revenues for additional information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INVENTORY RESERVESWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. 2019 FORM 10-K 41Table of ContentsCONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTSA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense.PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETSWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVESWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.INCOME TAXESWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.42 NIKE, INC.Table of ContentsWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changed previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act also transitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation. Certain provisions of the Tax Act, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. We completed our analysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.OTHER CONTINGENCIESIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 2019 FORM 10-K 43Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2019 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.MARKET RISK MEASUREMENTWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $34 million and $93 million at May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2019. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $83 million and $260 million during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.44 NIKE, INC.Table of ContentsThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.Since fiscal 2018, through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy, we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. In June 2020, we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy: Consumer Direct Acceleration. This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas. First, creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need. This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our own stores, as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision. Second, we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Men’s, Women’s and Kids'. This approach allows us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs, including more specialization of our category approach, while re-aligning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities. In particular, we’ll be reinvesting in our Women’s and Kids’ businesses and will also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the company to optimize effectiveness. Third, we will unify investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. On July 22, 2020, management announced a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up strategic execution. These changes are expected to lead to a net loss of jobs, resulting in pre-tax, one-time employee termination costs of approximately $200 million to $250 million, which is expected to be incurred primarily during the first half of fiscal 2021, in the form of cash expenditures. These amounts are subject to change until such time as all details are finalized. This next phase of our Consumer Direct Offense is expected to drive sustainable growth and profitability as we accelerate NIKE to a digital-first company. We are committed to the execution of this strategy, despite the short-term adverse impacts to our business from a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). As such, our long-term financial goals on average, per year, remain the same and are outlined below:•High single-digit revenue growth;•Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points;•Slight selling and administrative expense leverage;•Mid-teens earnings per share growth; and•Low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital. COVID-19 UPDATECOVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. To date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. As a result, COVID-19 has impacted our business globally, including through store closures, reduced operating hours and decreased retail traffic. In particular, the outbreak and preventive measures taken to help curb the spread had material adverse impacts on our operations and business results in Greater China during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, following the temporary closure of, or reduced operating hours in, approximately 75% of NIKE-owned and partner stores within the region. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, our results of operations were further impacted as approximately 90% of our NIKE Brand stores across North America, EMEA and APLA, excluding Korea, were closed for approximately 8 weeks. The majority of Converse direct to consumer stores were also closed for a significant portion of the fourth quarter. Additionally, certain of our wholesale partners closed stores or reduced operating hours during the fourth quarter, resulting in lower than expected sales and a slowing of receipt of shipments of our products. The combined effect of store closures and reduced wholesale shipments caused higher than normal inventory levels at May 31, 2020, as Inventories grew 31% compared to the prior year. In order to manage future inventory growth and ensure a return to normalized levels we are modifying our buying plans and canceling certain pre-COVID-19 factory purchases, shifting product offer dates to meet near-term demand, as well as shifting available inventory into our digital channel and increasing digital fulfillment capacity specifically in 2020 FORM 10-K 27 Table of ContentsNorth America and EMEA. Additionally, we are investing in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate liquidation of excess inventory while continuing to protect the long-term health of our product franchises.COVID-19 also impacted our distribution centers, our third-party manufacturing partners and other vendors, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages and real time changes in operating procedures to accommodate social distancing guidelines and additional cleaning and disinfection procedures. In response to the uncertainty of the pandemic described above, we enhanced our liquidity position during the fourth quarter through the issuance of $6 billion in senior unsecured notes, the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program and by entering into a new committed credit facility agreement, which provides for an additional $2 billion of borrowings. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional discussion. Throughout the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, our digital commerce remained open, supported by the employees in the distribution centers. During the fourth quarter, NIKE Brand digital remained our fastest growing channel, growing 79% on a currency-neutral basis with each of our geographies growing over 50%. Beginning in mid-May, stores within our NIKE Direct operations gradually began reopening. As of July 17, 2020, over 90% of our NIKE Direct stores have reopened across the globe, with 100% open in Greater China, over 90% open in both EMEA and North America, and APLA open over 70%. As of July 17, 2020, substantially all Converse direct to consumer stores have reopened to serve consumers.We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we do expect they will have a material adverse impact on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may continue to lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets, revised payment terms with certain of our wholesale customers, higher sales-related reserves, factory cancellation costs and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Company's jurisdictions.On March 27, 2020, in response to COVID-19, the United States government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the ""CARES Act""). The CARES Act is a relief package consisting of various stimulus measures, such as tax payment deferrals, various business incentives and makes certain technical corrections to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The enactment of such legislation, while favorable, did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements.FISCAL 2020 OVERVIEWFiscal 2020 NIKE, Inc. Revenues declined 4% to $37.4 billion, as revenue growth of 7% for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was more than offset by a 38% decline in the fourth quarter due to the impacts of COVID-19. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, experienced a 4% decline, down 2% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines across nearly all geographies, partially offset by 11% currency-neutral growth in Greater China. NIKE Direct grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis driven by 49% growth in digital, with all geographies growing strong double digits, while wholesale revenues declined 7%. Revenues for Converse declined 3% and 1%, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, as revenue growth in Asia was more than offset by declines in North America, Europe and licensee markets.Income before income taxes decreased 40% for fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower revenues and gross margin resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, as well as higher selling and administrative expense. For the first nine months of fiscal 2020, gross margin expanded 30 basis points compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019. However, this was more than offset by a decline of 820 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due the impacts of COVID-19. For fiscal 2020, NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 130 basis points as higher full-price average selling price (ASP), on a wholesale equivalent basis, was more than offset by higher product costs due to incremental tariffs in the U.S., as well as factory cancellation charges, higher inventory obsolescence reserves and the negative rate impacts of supply chain costs on a lower volume of wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Selling and administrative expense increased, due to higher operating overhead expense partially offset by lower demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased due to higher wage-related expenses, as a result of our continued investment in end-to-end digital capabilities, and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by lower travel and related spend. Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower retail brand presentation costs and sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed or canceled and a majority of stores were closed globally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. These decreases were partially offset by higher digital brand marketing costs.Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.As we continue to execute against the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focused on optimizing country operating models across our global portfolio and we remain committed to investing in our most significant growth opportunities. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we announced our intention to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to strategic third-party distributors in an effort to more personally serve consumers in these respective marketplaces while driving 2020 FORM 10-K 28Table of Contentssustainable, profitable growth. These transactions are expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2021. As a result of this decision, the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as held-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2020. Additionally, we recognized a non-recurring impairment charge of $405 million, within Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income, classified within Corporate. This charge was primarily due to the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses, and could fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates up to the date of close. In future quarters, as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries, we expect consolidated NIKE, Inc. and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms. However, we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility. On October 29, 2019, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the assets and liabilities of our wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Hurley. The transaction closed on December 6, 2019, and the impacts of the divestiture are not considered material to the Company.While foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability. We remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 23, 2019.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, as well as Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends.

Revenues declined 2% for fiscal 2020, driven by lower revenues in both the NIKE Brand and Converse as the first nine months of revenue growth was offset by the impacts of lower shipments to wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations due to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter. Revenues for North America declined in fiscal 2020, reducing NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 4 percentage points, partially offset by revenue growth in Greater China contributing approximately 2 percentage points.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues decreased 2% for fiscal 2020, driven by declines in nearly all key categories, primarily Running, Sportswear and Training, partially offset by growth in the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear decreased 8%, partially offset by higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points. The increase in ASP was primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues decreased 3% for fiscal 2020, due to declines in most key categories, primarily Running, Training and Football (Soccer), partially offset by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of apparel decreased 8%, partially offset by higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 5 percentage points. The increase in ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 35% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2020, compared to 32% for fiscal 2019. Digital commerce sales were $5.5 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to $3.8 billion for fiscal 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2020, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 49%, which more than offset comparable store sales contraction of 12% due to temporary store closures and stores operating on reduced hours as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales, which exclude digital commerce sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2020 NIKE Brand Men's and Women's revenues decreased 4% and 3%, respectively. Lower NIKE Brand Men's revenues were driven by declines in nearly all key categories, primarily Running and Training, partially offset by growth in the Jordan Brand. Lower NIKE Brand Women's revenues were driven by declines in most key categories, primarily Running and Training, partially offset by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Revenues for our NIKE Kids' business decreased 3%, as declines primarily in Football (Soccer) more than offset growth in the Jordan Brand.2020 FORM 10-K 32Table of ContentsGROSS MARGINFISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019For fiscal 2020, our consolidated gross profit decreased 7% to $16,241 million compared to $17,474 million for fiscal 2019, which was significantly impacted by lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations due to COVID-19. Gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 43.4% for fiscal 2020 compared to 44.7% for fiscal 2019 due to the following:*Wholesale equivalentHigher product costs were in part due to incremental tariffs in North America. Higher other costs, primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of COVID-19, were specifically related to increased factory cancellations costs, higher inventory obsolescence and the adverse rate impact of supply chain costs on a lower volume of wholesale shipments.TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2020FISCAL 2019% CHANGEFISCAL 2018% CHANGEDemand creation expense(1)$3,592$3,753-4%$3,5775%Operating overhead expense9,5348,9497%7,93413%Total selling and administrative expense$13,126$12,7023%$11,51110%% of revenues35.1%32.5%260 bps31.6%90 bps(1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation.FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019Demand creation expense decreased 4% for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, due to lower retail brand presentation costs and lower sports marketing investments, as well as decreased advertising and marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed or canceled and a majority of stores were closed globally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. These decreases were partially offset by higher digital brand marketing costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2020.Operating overhead expense increased 7% for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, driven by higher wage-related and administrative expenses to support our continued investments in end-to-end digital capabilities, including support for a new enterprise resource planning tool. Operating overhead expense was further impacted by higher bad debt expense recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and related spend. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage points for fiscal 2020.OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET(Dollars in millions) FISCAL 2020 FISCAL 2019 FISCAL 2018Other (income) expense, net $139 $(78) $66Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.2020 FORM 10-K 33 Table of ContentsFISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 Other (income) expense, net changed from $78 million of other income, net for fiscal 2019 to $139 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the non-recurring impairment charge of $405 million related to our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA. For more information see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This was offset by a $121 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $91 million for fiscal 2020.

Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.OPERATING SEGMENTSOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands, with results for the Hurley Brand, prior to its divestiture, included in North America. Refer to Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company, and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.2020 FORM 10-K 34Table of ContentsThe breakdown of revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2020FISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)FISCAL 2018% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)North America$14,484$15,902-9 %-9 %$14,8557 %7 %Europe, Middle East & Africa9,3479,812-5 %-1 %9,2426 %11 %Greater China6,6796,2088 %11 %5,13421 %24 %Asia Pacific & Latin America5,0285,254-4 %1 %5,1662 %13 %Global Brand Divisions(2)3042-29 %-26 %88-52 %-53 %TOTAL NIKE BRAND35,56837,218-4 %-2 %34,4858 %11 %Converse1,8461,906-3 %-1 %1,8861 %3 %Corporate(3)(11)(7)——26——TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-brand experiences in NIKE Direct. Specifically, in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. The evolution of the North America marketplace is resulting in third-party retail store closures, which is expected to be further accelerated as a result of the effects of COVID-19; however, we remain focused on building long-term momentum with our strategic wholesale customers, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital.FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues decreased 9%, as revenue growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was offset by declines in the fourth quarter, primarily resulting from lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations due to COVID-19. Revenues declined in nearly all key categories, primarily Running and Training. NIKE Direct revenues increased 2% for fiscal 2020 as strong digital commerce sales growth of 45% more than offset a 20% decline in comparable store sales due to temporary store closures and stores operating on reduced hours as a result of COVID-19 during the fourth quarter.Footwear revenues contracted 7% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal 2020, driven by declines in nearly all key categories, primarily Running, Training and Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear decreased 13%, partially offset by higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, as well as higher full-price ASP.On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues decreased 12% for fiscal 2020 as lower revenues in nearly all key categories, primarily Training, were partially offset by growth in Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel decreased 16%, partially offset by higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 4 percentage points. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily a result of higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Reported EBIT decreased 26% for fiscal 2020, reflecting lower revenues, gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin declined 230 basis points as higher-full price ASP was more than offset by higher product costs, primarily due to incremental tariffs, as well as increased costs specifically in the fourth quarter due to COVID-19 for warehousing and freight, the adverse rate impact of supply chain costs on a lower volume of wholesale shipments, factory cancellations and inventory obsolescence. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead expense, partially offset by lower demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to higher bad debt expense and higher administrative costs. The decrease in demand creation expense reflected higher digital brand marketing costs, which were more than offset by lower retail brand presentation costs and sports marketing expenses as leagues and sporting events were suspended and a majority of stores within our NIKE Direct operations were closed during the fourth quarter due to COVID-19. 2020 FORM 10-K 36Table of ContentsEUROPE, MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2020FISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2018% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues by: Footwear$5,892$6,293-6 %-3 %$5,8757%12%Apparel3,0533,087-1 %2 %2,9405%9%Equipment402432-7 %-3 %4271%5%TOTAL REVENUES$9,347$9,812-5 %-1 %$9,2426%11%Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers$6,574$7,076-7 %-4 %$6,7655%9%Sales through NIKE Direct2,7732,7361 %5 %2,47710%15%TOTAL REVENUES$9,347$9,812-5 %-1 %$9,2426%11%EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES$1,541$1,995-23 % $1,58726% FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA revenues for fiscal 2020 declined 1%, as revenue growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was offset by declines in the fourth quarter, primarily resulting from lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations due to COVID-19. The decline reflects lower revenues in the Northern Europe and Southern Europe territories, which each declined 8%, partially offset by growth in UK & Ireland of 5%. Revenues decreased in most key categories, primarily Football (Soccer) and Running, partially offset by growth in the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 5% due to strong digital commerce sales growth of 50%, partially offset by a 15% decline in comparable store sales due to temporary store closures and stores operating on reduced hours as a result of COVID-19, as well as declines from certain store closures as we continually optimize our fleet to meet consumer demand across physical and digital channels.Currency-neutral footwear revenues contracted 3% for fiscal 2020, driven by lower revenues in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear decreased 10%, partially offset by higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 7 percentage points. Higher ASP per pair primarily resulted from higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.For fiscal 2020, currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 2% as growth in several key categories, most notably Sportswear and the Jordan Brand, was partially offset by declines in Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel decreased 2%, partially offset by higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 4 percentage points. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price ASP.Reported EBIT decreased 23% for fiscal 2020 due to lower revenues, gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin declined 240 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher other costs, which primarily occurred in the fourth quarter due to COVID-19 and reflected increased warehousing and freight costs, the adverse rate impact of supply chain costs on a lower volume of wholesale shipments and higher inventory obsolescence. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead expense, partially offset by lower demand creation expense. Growth in operating overhead expense was primarily due to higher bad debt expense.

Unit sales of footwear increased 10% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP.The currency-neutral apparel revenue growth of 8% for fiscal 2020 was fueled by higher revenues in most key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of apparel increased 8%, while ASP per unit was flat as higher off-price and full-price ASPs were offset by unfavorable full-price mix and lower NIKE Direct ASP.Reported EBIT increased 5% for fiscal 2020, driven by higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage, partially offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 170 basis points as unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs more than offset higher full-price ASP. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Growth in operating overhead expense was driven by higher investments within our NIKE Direct operations. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher retail brand presentation costs, including digital brand marketing.2020 FORM 10-K 38Table of ContentsASIA PACIFIC & LATIN AMERICA(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2020FISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2018% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues by: Footwear$3,449$3,622-5 %0 %$3,5751 %12%Apparel1,3651,395-2 %3 %1,3474 %15%Equipment214237-10 %-4 %244-3 %8%TOTAL REVENUES$5,028$5,254-4 %1 %$5,1662 %13%Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers$3,408$3,746-9 %-4 %$3,829-2 %9%Sales through NIKE Direct1,6201,5087 %12 %1,33713 %23%TOTAL REVENUES$5,028$5,254-4 %1 %$5,1662 %13%EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES$1,184$1,323-11 % $1,18911 % As discussed previously, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and shift to a distributor operating model. The impacts of entering into these agreements are included within Corporate and are not reflected in the APLA operating segment results for fiscal 2020.FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019On a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 1% for fiscal 2020. The increase in revenues reflected growth in the Korea and SOCO (which comprises Argentina, Uruguay and Chile) territories of 14% and 6%, respectively, partially offset by declines in Mexico of 9%. Revenues increased in several key categories, led by the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 12%, fueled by strong digital commerce sales growth of 62% and the addition of new stores, partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales of 4% due to temporary store closures and stores operating on reduced hours as a result of COVID-19 during the fourth quarter.Currency-neutral footwear revenues for fiscal 2020 were flat as growth in the Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball was offset by declines in all other key categories, primarily Training. Unit sales of footwear decreased 12%, offset by higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 12 percentage points, driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, both of which in part reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.Currency-neutral apparel revenues grew 3% for fiscal 2020, driven by higher revenues in several key categories, most notably Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel decreased 5%, which were more than offset by higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 8 percentage points, primarily driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, both of which in part reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.Reported EBIT decreased 11% for fiscal 2020 reflecting lower revenues and gross margin contraction, partially offset by lower selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased 140 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by higher product costs, unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, as well as higher other costs. The increase in other costs primarily occurred in the fourth quarter due to COVID-19 and reflected increased warehousing and freight, as well as higher inventory obsolescence. Selling and administrative expense decreased as lower demand creation expense was partially offset by higher operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower sports marketing costs, advertising and marketing expenses, as well as lower retail brand presentation costs as sporting events were postponed or canceled and a majority of stores were closed during the fourth quarter due to COVID-19. The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily due to higher bad debt expense and higher wage-related costs. 2020 FORM 10-K 39 Table of ContentsGLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2020FISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2018% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues$30$42-29 %-26 %$88-52 %-53 %Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes$(3,468)$(3,262)-6 % $(2,658)-23 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expense, including product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology. Revenues for Global Brand Divisions are primarily attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment.FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes increased 6% for fiscal 2020 as total selling and administrative expense increased compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher operating overhead expense. The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily driven by higher wage-related and administrative costs resulting from investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and our continued investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool, all of which are in an effort to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation.CONVERSE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2020FISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2018% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues by: Footwear$1,642$1,658-1 %1 %$1,6113 %5 %Apparel89$118-25 %-22 %$144-18 %-17 %Equipment25244 %8 %28-14 %-13 %Other(1)90106-15 %-14 %1033 %4 %TOTAL REVENUES$1,846$1,906-3 %-1 %$1,8861 %3 %Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers$1,154$1,247-7 %-5 %$1,310-5 %2 %Sales through Direct to Consumer6025539 %11 %47317 %5 %Other(1)90106-15 %-14 %1033 %4 %TOTAL REVENUES$1,846$1,906-3 %-1 %$1,8861 %3 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES$297$303-2 %$310-2 %(1)Other revenues consist of territories serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalties to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues decreased 1% for fiscal 2020, as revenue growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was offset by declines in the fourth quarter, primarily resulting from lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures in our direct to consumer operations due to COVID-19. Revenue declines in North America and Europe, as well as in licensee markets were partially offset by increases in Asia. Wholesale revenues decreased 5% while direct to consumer revenues increased 11%, as strong digital sales growth across all geographies more than offset declines from Converse owned store closures due to COVID-19. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 6%, while ASP grew 6% primarily due to the favorable impact on ASP of growth in the direct to consumer channel and growth within the Asia geography.Reported EBIT decreased 2%, primarily driven by declines in revenues, partially offset by gross margin expansion and lower selling and administrative expenses. Gross margin increased 60 basis points driven by higher full-price ASP, in part due to growth in our higher margin Asia geography, as well as higher ASP in our direct to consumer channel, primarily through digital, both of which were only partially offset by unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased primarily due to decreases in demand creation expense, as operating overhead expense was flat. Demand creation expense decreased as a result of lower advertising and marketing in response to COVID-19.

This charge primarily reflects the anticipated release of associated non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses.FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 The Corporate loss before interest and taxes increased $157 million primarily due to the following:•an unfavorable change of $494 million, primarily due to the $405 million non-recurring impairment charge discussed above. For more information see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements;•a favorable change of $213 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and•a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $124 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net.FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICESOVERVIEWAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact 2020 FORM 10-K 41 Table of Contentsof exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.2020 FORM 10-K 42Table of ContentsCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $867 million, a detriment of approximately $1,236 million, and a benefit of approximately $832 million for the years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $212 million, a detriment of approximately $233 million, and a benefit of approximately $177 million for the years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the period ended May 31, 2020, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates.MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $91 million, $97 million, and $110 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIESWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.2020 FORM 10-K 43 Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOW ACTIVITYCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $2,485 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $5,903 million for fiscal 2019. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,730 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2020 compared to $5,341 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease primarily reflects lower Net Income, resulting from the unfavorable impacts of COVID-19. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations of $1,245 million for fiscal 2020, compared to an increase of $562 million for fiscal 2019. The net change in working capital was impacted by a $1,364 million increase in Inventories, in part reflecting lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations, as well as a decrease in Accounts Payable resulting from lower spending, both of which are due to COVID-19. The net change in working capital was also unfavorably impacted by the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging transactions. During fiscal 2020, cash collateral received from counterparties decreased $289 million compared to an increase of $266 million in fiscal 2019. Refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. In addition, the net change in working capital was impacted by a $1,509 million reduction in Accounts receivable, net, in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by lower revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of COVID-19.Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $1,028 million for fiscal 2020, compared to an outflow of $264 million for fiscal 2019, driven primarily by lower proceeds from the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2020, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $27 million compared to $850 million in fiscal 2019. Additionally, during fiscal 2020, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. We expect this trend to continue in future periods.Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an inflow of $2,491 million for fiscal 2020 compared to an outflow of $5,293 million for fiscal 2019, primarily due to the net proceeds from a $5,942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as well as lower share repurchases during fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, we purchased 33.5 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $3,033 million (an average price of $90.49 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2020, we had repurchased 45.2 million shares at a cost of $4,019 million (an average price of $89.00 per share) under this new program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt. To enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program. The existing program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time, depending upon market conditions, our capital needs and other factors. CAPITAL RESOURCESOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022. On March 27, 2020 we issued $6 billion of senior unsecured notes with tranches maturing March 27, 2025, March 27, 2027, March 27, 2030, March 27, 2040 and March 27, 2050. For additional information regarding our long-term debt refer to Note 8 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 16, 2019, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total upon lender approval. The facility matures on August 16, 2024, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 16, 2026. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on August 28, 2015, which would have matured August 28, 2020. On April 6, 2020, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, in addition to the existing credit facility discussed above. The new facility matures on April 5, 2021. As of May 31, 2020 and 2019, no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit facility entered into on August 16, 2019, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Under the committed credit facility entered into on April 6, 2020, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, only the interest rate would increase, but would remain unchanged in the event our long-term debt rating were to improve. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These 2020 FORM 10-K 44Table of Contentscovenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2020, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $4 billion commercial paper program, which we increased by $2 billion during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $1,456 million. As of May 31, 2020, we had $248 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.65%. No commercial paper was outstanding as of May 31, 2019.We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.To date, in fiscal 2020, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.As of May 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $8.8 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2020, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 14 days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. Given our existing structure, if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2020, and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:DESCRIPTION OF COMMITMENTCASH PAYMENTS DUE DURING THE YEAR ENDING MAY 31,(Dollars in millions)20212022202320242025THEREAFTERTOTALOperating Leases$550$514$456$416$374$1,474$3,784Long-Term Debt(1)2892867862751,27511,54114,452Endorsement Contracts(2)1,3301,4711,1781,0641,1353,1649,342Product Purchase Obligations(3)4,234—————4,234Other Purchase Obligations(4)1,0853451891361273452,227Transition Tax Related to the Tax Act(5)868686161215268902TOTAL$7,574$2,702$2,695$2,052$3,126$16,792$34,941(1)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2020 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(2)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the 2020 FORM 10-K 45 Table of Contentsamounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(3)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.(4)Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of a given date. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.REVENUE RECOGNITIONOn June 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior to fiscal 2019, amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies. Our revenue recognition policies under Topic 606 are described 2020 FORM 10-K 46Table of Contentsin the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605 — Revenue Recognition, are included below in the event they are substantially different.Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. Prior to fiscal 2019, the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.As part of our revenue recognition policy, consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to fiscal 2019, reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within Accounts receivable, net for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for our direct to consumer business, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.Refer also to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 — Revenues for additional information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INVENTORY RESERVESWe make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTSA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we 2020 FORM 10-K 47 Table of Contentsrecord the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense.PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETSWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVESWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.INCOME TAXESWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.We have not recorded withholding tax expense for foreign earnings we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested within certain of our foreign jurisdictions. The amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings are generated, the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. operations may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional withholding tax expense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore.2020 FORM 10-K 48Table of ContentsOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changed previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act also transitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation. Certain provisions of the Tax Act, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. We completed our analysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.OTHER CONTINGENCIESIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.2020 FORM 10-K 49 Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2020 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar and Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.MARKET RISK MEASUREMENTWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $48 million and $34 million at May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2020. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $126 million and $83 million during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.2020 FORM 10-K 50Table of ContentsThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2021,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.Since fiscal 2018, through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy, we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. In June 2020, we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy: Consumer Direct Acceleration. This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas. First, creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need. This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our owned stores, as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision. Second, we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Men’s, Women’s and Kids'. This approach is intended to allow us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs, including more specialization of our category approach, while re-aligning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities. In particular, we expect to reinvest in our Women’s and Kids’ businesses and also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the Company to optimize effectiveness. Third, we will unify investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. As such, our new financial goals through fiscal 2025 are outlined below: •High single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth;•Gross margin rate in the high 40s by fiscal 2025;•Earnings before interest and taxes as a percent of revenues (""EBIT Margin"") in the high teens by fiscal 2025;•Mid to high teens diluted earnings per share growth;•Exceeding low 30% range rate of return on invested capital (ROIC); and•Annual capital expenditures at roughly 3% of Revenues.As a result of our strategic acceleration, management announced on July 22, 2020, a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up our execution. These changes resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and during fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $294 million, which relate to employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. All related actions are now substantially complete, and we expect future annual wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 21 — Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.COVID-19 UPDATEThroughout fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business results and operations globally. Our business and wholesale partners experienced temporary store closures and stores operating on reduced hours, as a result of mandatory lockdowns across our North America, EMEA and APLA geographies. Additionally, disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and U.S. port congestion interrupted the flow of our inventory. Despite the disruption caused by the pandemic, we achieved record Revenues for fiscal 2021, which increased 19% to $44.5 billion, compared to the prior fiscal year, with gross margin expansion of 140 basis points. We ended the fiscal year with Inventories down 7% compared to May 31, 2020, and our liquidity position remains strong with $13.5 billion of Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments, an increase of $4.7 billion compared to May 31, 2020. Our NIKE Direct business fueled our growth throughout the year as we navigated the pandemic, leveraging our digital platforms with our store footprint to connect directly with the consumer. NIKE Brand digital revenues grew 60% on a currency-neutral basis, with strong double-digit growth across each of our geographies. Despite temporary store closures throughout the year, due to COVID-19 safety-related measures, we experienced a 4% increase in comparable store sales, driven by growth in Greater China and North America, partially offset by declines in EMEA and APLA. As of July 15, 2021, approximately 99% of our owned stores were open with some operating on reduced hours. 2021 FORM 10-K 28Table of ContentsWe continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation, as well as guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. There remains risk that COVID-19 could have material adverse impacts on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets, adverse impacts on the global supply chain, revised payment terms with certain of our wholesale customers, higher sales-related reserves, factory cancellation costs and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our jurisdictions.FISCAL 2021 OVERVIEWIn fiscal 2021, NIKE, Inc. achieved record Revenues which increased 19% to $44.5 billion. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, experienced growth of 19%, up 17% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by increases across all geographies. NIKE Direct grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by 60% growth in digital, with all geographies growing strong double digits, while wholesale revenues grew 10%. Revenues for Converse increased 19% and 16%, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, led by strong double-digit growth in digital.Income (loss) before income taxes increased 131% for fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage. NIKE, Inc. gross margin increased 140 basis points primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19 including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. The increase in gross margin also reflects higher full-price product margins across wholesale and NIKE Direct. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower Demand creation expense, partially offset by higher Operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail operations, as well as lower sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher digital marketing investments. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to an increase in strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct variable costs and $255 million in restructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and travel and related expenses. ROIC as of May 31, 2021, was 48.8% compared to 21.5% as of May 31, 2020. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for further information.During fiscal 2020, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and to shift to a distributor operating model. During fiscal 2021, the transaction with Grupo SBF S.A. to purchase substantially all of our NIKE Brand operations in Brazil closed. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we mutually agreed with Grupo Axo to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKE’s businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to a distributor partnership. However, as we remain committed to selling the legal entities in all three countries and granting distribution rights to third-party distributors, the assets and liabilities of the entities have remained classified as held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2021. For more information related to our planned distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In future quarters, as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries, we expect consolidated NIKE, Inc. and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms. However, we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility. While foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics which may lead to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability. We remain committed to effectively managing our business and mitigating financial market risks to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2020 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 24, 2020.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT, as well as EBIT Margin and ROIC, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. EBIT Margin 2021 FORM 10-K 29 Table of Contentsis calculated as EBIT divided by total NIKE Inc. Revenues. ROIC represents a performance measure that management believes is useful information in understanding the Company's ability to effectively manage invested capital, see the table below for how the Company calculates this measure.Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, ROIC and EBIT should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.Our ROIC calculation as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS ENDED(Dollars in millions)MAY 31, 2021MAY 31, 2020NumeratorNet income $5,727 $2,539 Add: Interest expense (income), net262 89 Add: Income tax expense934 348 Earnings before interest and taxes6,923 2,976 Income tax adjustment(1)(970)(352)Earnings before interest and after taxes$5,953 $2,624 AVERAGE FOR THE TRAILING FIVE QUARTERS ENDEDMAY 31, 2021MAY 31, 2020DenominatorTotal debt(2),(3)$12,890 $8,022 Add: Shareholders' equity10,523 8,938 Less: Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments11,217 4,756 Total invested capital$12,196 $12,204 RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL48.8 %21.5 %(1)Equals Earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate as of the respective quarter end.(2)Total debt includes the following: 1) Current portion of long-term debt, 2) Notes Payable, 3) Current portion of operating lease liabilities, 4) Long-term debt and 5) Operating lease liabilities.(3)The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification No. 842, Leases, on June 1, 2019.

Revenues increased 17% for fiscal 2021, driven by growth in both the NIKE Brand and Converse. Higher revenues in North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, with EMEA and Greater China each contributing approximately 4 percentage points of growth and APLA and Converse each contributing approximately 1 percentage point of growth.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2021, driven by growth in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 11%, while higher average selling price (ASP), on a wholesale equivalent basis, per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. The increase in ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2021, due to growth in all key categories, primarily Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of apparel increased 14%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP, partially offset by lower full-price ASP.On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 39% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2021 compared to 35% for fiscal 2020. Digital commerce sales were $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to $5.5 billion for fiscal 2020. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 30% for fiscal 2021, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 60%, comparable store sales growth of 4% and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude digital commerce sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2021 NIKE Brand Men's and Women's revenues increased 11% and 20%, respectively. Higher NIKE Brand Men's revenues were driven by growth in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Football (Soccer). Higher NIKE Brand Women's revenues were driven by growth in all key categories, primarily Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, Training and Running. Revenues for our NIKE Kids' business increased 15%, due to growth primarily in the Jordan Brand and Football (Soccer).2021 FORM 10-K 33 Table of ContentsGROSS MARGINFISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020For fiscal 2021, our consolidated gross profit increased 23% to $19,962 million compared to $16,241 million for fiscal 2020, as the prior fiscal year was significantly impacted by lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations due to COVID-19. Gross margin increased 140 basis points to 44.8% for fiscal 2021 compared to 43.4% for fiscal 2020 due to the following:*Wholesale equivalentFavorable NIKE Brand full-price product margins across both our wholesale and NIKE Direct businesses primarily reflect higher full-price ASP, net of discounts. Additionally, the favorable impact of growth in our higher margin NIKE Direct business, led by NIKE owned Digital, was more than offset by higher promotions in our factory stores during the first half of fiscal 2021 to reduce excess inventory as a result of COVID-19. Lower other costs are due to annualizing certain impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal 2020, including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments.TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGEFISCAL 2019% CHANGEDemand creation expense(1)$3,114 $3,592 -13 %$3,753 -4 %Operating overhead expense9,911 9,534 4 %8,949 7 %Total selling and administrative expense$13,025 $13,126 -1 %$12,702 3 %% of revenues29.2 %35.1 %(590) bps32.5 %260 bps(1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation.FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020Demand creation expense decreased 13% for fiscal 2021, due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail operations, as well as lower sports marketing expense as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19. This activity was partially offset by higher digital marketing investments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2021.Operating overhead expense increased 4% for fiscal 2021, due to an increase in strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct variable costs, and approximately $255 million in restructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and related expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2021.OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020FISCAL 2019Other (income) expense, net$14 $139 $(78)Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.2021 FORM 10-K 34Table of ContentsFISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 Other (income) expense, net decreased from $139 million of other expense, net in fiscal 2020 to $14 million of other expense, net in the current year, primarily due to the non-recurring impairment charge of $405 million incurred in the prior year associated with our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA, partially offset by a $241 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges. For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses, and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $19 million for fiscal 2021.

OPERATING SEGMENTSOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands, with results for the Hurley brand, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, included in North America. Refer to Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.2021 FORM 10-K 35 Table of ContentsThe breakdown of Revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)FISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)North America$17,179 $14,484 19 %19 %$15,902 -9 %-9 %Europe, Middle East & Africa11,456 9,347 23 %17 %9,812 -5 %-1 %Greater China8,290 6,679 24 %19 %6,208 8 %11 %Asia Pacific & Latin America(2)5,343 5,028 6 %8 %5,254 -4 %1 %Global Brand Divisions(3)25 30 -17 %-17 %42 -29 %-26 %TOTAL NIKE BRAND42,293 35,568 19 %17 %37,218 -4 %-2 %Converse2,205 1,846 19 %16 %1,906 -3 %-1 %Corporate(4)40 (11)— — (7)— — TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-brand experiences in NIKE Direct. We anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. Specifically in North America, we remain focused on building long-term momentum with our strategic wholesale customers, which offer a differentiated retail experience. Additionally, over the last three years we have significantly reduced the number of undifferentiated wholesale accounts. During fiscal 2021, we took further steps towards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocation to benefit NIKE Direct and our differentiated strategic wholesale customers. We expect that over the next two fiscal years, we will more aggressively accelerate these changes as we work to reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture wholesale revenue declines over time.FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues increased 19%, driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 37%, driven by strong digital sales growth of 73%, comparable store sales growth of 5% and the addition of new stores.Footwear revenues increased 25% on a currency-neutral basis due to higher revenues in several key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 17%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, in part reflecting lower-discounts, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021 driven by growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 8%, while ASP per unit was flat, as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business was offset by lower full-price ASP. Reported EBIT increased 76% driven by higher revenues, lower selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues and gross margin expansion. Gross margin increased approximately 430 basis points, primarily due to lower other costs, higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and lower product costs. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal 2020, including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves and the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily as a result of lower bad debt and wage-related expenses, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable costs. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing expense for brand events and our retail operations, as well as lower sports marketing expense, partially offset by continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand.2021 FORM 10-K 37 Table of ContentsEUROPE, MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues by:Footwear$6,970 $5,892 18 %13 %$6,293 -6 %-3 %Apparel3,996 3,053 31 %25 %3,087 -1 %2 %Equipment490 402 22 %19 %432 -7 %-3 %TOTAL REVENUES$11,456 $9,347 23 %17 %$9,812 -5 %-1 %Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers$7,812 $6,574 19 %14 %$7,076 -7 %-4 %Sales through NIKE Direct3,644 2,773 31 %25 %2,736 1 %5 %TOTAL REVENUES$11,456 $9,347 23 %17 %$9,812 -5 %-1 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES$2,435 $1,541 58 %$1,995 -23 % FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA revenues for fiscal 2021 grew 17%, driven by higher revenues across nearly all territories, led by UK & Ireland and Central Europe, which grew 34% and 20%, respectively. Revenues increased in all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 25%, driven by strong digital sales growth of 67%, partially offset by a 10% decline in comparable store sales, primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19.Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 13%, driven by higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear increased 9% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points, resulting from higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 25% due to growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 26%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to a lower mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts.Reported EBIT increased 58% as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased approximately 110 basis points primarily due to lower NIKE Direct margins and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset lower product costs and lower other costs. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower inventory obsolescence reserves, as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily driven by lower retail brand presentation costs and lower sports marketing expense. Lower operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower bad debt and travel and related expenses, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable costs.2021 FORM 10-K 38Table of ContentsGREATER CHINA(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues by:Footwear$5,748 $4,635 24 %19 %$4,262 9 %12 %Apparel2,347 1,896 24 %19 %1,808 5 %8 %Equipment195 148 32 %26 %138 7 %11 %TOTAL REVENUES$8,290 $6,679 24 %19 %$6,208 8 %11 %Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers$4,513 $3,803 19 %14 %$3,726 2 %6 %Sales through NIKE Direct3,777 2,876 31 %26 %2,482 16 %20 %TOTAL REVENUES$8,290 $6,679 24 %19 %$6,208 8 %11 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES$3,243 $2,490 30 % $2,376 5 % FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, Greater China revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 19%, driven by higher revenues in all key categories, led by Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball.

Higher ASP was driven by higher off-price ASP, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP due to higher levels of promotion to liquidate excess inventory through our factory stores.Reported EBIT increased 30% as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased approximately 200 basis points primarily due to unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense, partially offset by higher operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower advertising and marketing, as well as digital marketing expenses. Growth in operating overhead expense was driven by higher investments within our NIKE Direct operations.2021 FORM 10-K 39 Table of ContentsASIA PACIFIC & LATIN AMERICA(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues by:Footwear$3,659 $3,449 6 %8 %$3,622 -5 %0 %Apparel1,494 1,365 9 %10 %1,395 -2 %3 %Equipment190 214 -11 %-9 %237 -10 %-4 %TOTAL REVENUES$5,343 $5,028 6 %8 %$5,254 -4 %1 %Revenues by:Sales to Wholesale Customers$3,387 $3,408 -1 %2 %$3,746 -9 %-4 %Sales through NIKE Direct1,956 1,620 21 %22 %1,508 7 %12 %TOTAL REVENUES$5,343 $5,028 6 %8 %$5,254 -4 %1 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES$1,530 $1,184 29 %$1,323 -11 %As discussed previously, our NIKE Brand business in Brazil transitioned to a distributor operating model during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and our NIKE Brand businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay have remained classified as held-for-sale. The impacts of closing the Brazil transaction as well as entering into agreements to transition these entities in the prior year are included within Corporate and are not reflected in the APLA operating segment results. For more information see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020On a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021. The increase was due to higher revenues across most territories, led by a 15% increase in Japan, a 37% increase in Pacific, which includes Australia and New Zealand, and a 12% increase in Korea, partially offset by a decline in Latin Distributors of 48%. Additionally, the transition of our NIKE Brand business in Brazil to a third-party distributor operating model reduced APLA revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points. Revenues increased in most key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. NIKE Direct revenues increased 22%, primarily fueled by strong digital sales growth of 73%, partially offset by comparable store sales declines of 4%, largely due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19.Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in several key categories, primarily the Jordan Brand and Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear decreased 5%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory, which includes Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 10% for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in most key categories, led by Sportswear. Unit sales of apparel increased 5%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.Reported EBIT increased 29% for fiscal 2021 driven by higher revenues, lower selling and administrative expense and gross margin expansion. Gross margin increased approximately 130 basis points as higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory, and lower other costs, were partially offset by higher product costs, unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and lower margin in our NIKE Direct business. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower factory cancellation charges and lower inventory obsolescence reserves. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing expense, as well as a decline in sports marketing costs. Lower operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower bad debt and travel and related costs, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable costs.2021 FORM 10-K 40Table of ContentsGLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues$25 $30 -17 %-17 %$42 -29 %-26 %Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes$(3,656)$(3,468)-5 %$(3,262)-6 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expense, including product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.

The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily due to continued investments in digital capabilities, partially offset by lower travel and related expenses. Lower demand creation expense was primarily due to lower sports marketing costs.

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020On a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2021. The increase in revenues was driven by revenue growth across Western Europe, North America and Asia. Wholesale revenues increased 13%, driven primarily by growth in Western Europe and Asia, in part due to the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year. Direct to consumer revenues increased 24%, driven by strong digital sales growth across North America and Western Europe. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels increased 9%, while ASP increased 8%, primarily due to growth in full-price sales, including through our digital channel.Reported EBIT increased 83%, driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense. Gross margin was flat, as higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, and the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments was offset by higher product costs and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily due to lower bad debt, travel and related costs and other administrative costs. Demand creation expense decreased as a result of lower advertising and marketing, as well as digital marketing expenses.2021 FORM 10-K 41 Table of ContentsCORPORATE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGEFISCAL 2019% CHANGERevenues$40 $(11)— $(7)— Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes$(2,261)$(1,967)-15 %$(1,810)-9 %Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.The Corporate loss before interest and taxes primarily consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 Corporate's loss before interest and taxes increased $294 million during fiscal 2021, primarily due to the following:•an unfavorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $241 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net;•a favorable change of $132 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin; and•an unfavorable change of $185 million in part due to restructuring-related costs of $294 million associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020, partially offset by the $405 million charge in the prior year related to our planned distributor transition within APLA.For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, as well as more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, refer to Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 21 — Restructuring, respectively, within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICESOVERVIEWAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.2021 FORM 10-K 42Table of ContentsTRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.2021 FORM 10-K 43 Table of ContentsCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement, and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $893 million, a detriment of approximately $867 million and a detriment of approximately $1,236 million for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $260 million, a detriment of approximately $212 million and a detriment of approximately $233 million for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the period ended May 31, 2021, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates.MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $19 million and unfavorable impacts of $91 million and $97 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIESWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2021 and 2020. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.2021 FORM 10-K 44Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOW ACTIVITYCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $6,657 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $2,485 million for fiscal 2020. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,612 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2021 compared to $3,730 million for fiscal 2020. The increase primarily reflects the recovery of our business operations from the impact of COVID-19. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided (used) by operations of $45 million for fiscal 2021, compared to a decrease of $1,245 million for fiscal 2020. The net change in working capital was impacted by a $2,361 million decrease in Inventories, driven by strong consumer demand as we return to healthy inventory levels across markets closed in the prior year due to COVID-19. An increase in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities also contributed to the net change in working capital, primarily due to reduced spending in fiscal 2020 as a result of COVID-19. In addition, the net change in working capital was impacted by a $2,845 million increase in Accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, compared to an outflow of $1,028 million for fiscal 2020, primarily driven by higher purchases of short-term investments. During fiscal 2021, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $3,276 million compared to a cash inflow of $27 million in fiscal 2020. Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. In future periods, we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues.Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an inflow of $2,491 million for fiscal 2020. This change was primarily due to the net proceeds from a $5,942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by lower share repurchases during fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program. The existing program remained authorized by the Board of Directors and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we began repurchasing shares under the program. In fiscal 2021, we purchased 4.9 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $650 million (an average price of $133.54 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2021, we had repurchased 50.0 million shares at a cost of $4,669 million (an average price of $93.33 per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. CAPITAL RESOURCESOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022. On August 16, 2019, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total upon lender approval. The facility matures on August 16, 2024, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond August 16, 2026. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on August 28, 2015, which would have matured August 28, 2020. On March 15, 2021, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total upon lender approval. The facility matures on March 14, 2022, with a 364-day extension option up to 30 days prior to the existing termination date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond March 13, 2023. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on April 6, 2020, which would have matured on April 5, 2021. As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on August 16, 2019 and March 15, 2021, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become 2021 FORM 10-K 45 Table of Contentsimmediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2021, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity was also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program, which we decreased from $4 billion in connection with the new credit facility agreement, entered into on March 15, 2021, as described above. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $248 million. No commercial paper was outstanding as of May 31, 2021. As of May 31, 2020, we had $248 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.65%.We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.As of May 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $13.5 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2021, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 54 days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt. Given our existing structure, if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2021, and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:DESCRIPTION OF COMMITMENTCASH PAYMENTS DUE DURING THE YEAR ENDING MAY 31,(Dollars in millions)20222023202420252026THEREAFTERTOTALOperating Leases$534 $530 $490 $437 $357 $1,397 $3,745 Long-Term Debt(1)286 786 275 1,275 251 11,290 14,163 Endorsement Contracts(2)1,502 1,244 1,091 966 726 2,863 8,392 Product Purchase Obligations(3)6,448 — — — — — 6,448 Other Purchase Obligations(4)1,347 541 331 191 96 230 2,736 Transition Tax Related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act(5)86 86 161 215 268 — 816 TOTAL$10,203 $3,187 $2,348 $3,084 $1,698 $15,780 $36,300 (1)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2021 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(2)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.2021 FORM 10-K 46Table of ContentsIn addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2022,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which is comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as ""NIKE Brand Digital""), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.Through the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we are focusing on creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale partners that share our marketplace vision. Over the last several years, as we have executed against the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we have grown our NIKE Direct business to be approximately 42% of total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022, and we have reduced the number of wholesale accounts globally. Additionally, we have aligned our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Men’s, Women’s and Kids’ and continue to invest in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we expect will further accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. During fiscal 2021, we substantially completed a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up the strategic execution of the Consumer Direct Acceleration. These changes resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and during fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $294 million, which relate to employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. For fiscal 2022, we recognized an immaterial amount of related employee termination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. We expect future annual wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 21 — Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.COVID-19 AND MARKET DYNAMICS UPDATEThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the global supply chain created volatility in our fiscal 2022 business results and operations globally. Despite these challenges, we achieved record Revenues for fiscal 2022, which increased 5% compared to the prior fiscal year with gross margin expansion of 120 basis points. Our NIKE Direct business continued its momentum, growing 14% and 15% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, led by North America, APLA and EMEA, partially offset by declines in Greater China due to a COVID-19 resurgence in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 as well as marketplace dynamics. During fiscal 2022, nearly all of our owned stores remained open across North America, EMEA and APLA. In Greater China however, due to a COVID-19 resurgence, we experienced a higher level of temporary store closures, with some operating on reduced hours, as well as lower physical traffic compared to pre-pandemic levels.During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the majority of NIKE Brand and Converse contract manufacturers in Vietnam and Indonesia were subject to government mandated shutdowns due to COVID-19. As a result of these closures, we lost approximately three months of production, impacting available product supply throughout fiscal 2022. Globally, nearly all of our supplier base is currently operational without restrictions and with factory production exceeding pre-closure production levels. In addition, our supply of available inventory continued to be impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as extended inventory transit times drove elevated levels of in-transit inventory. These supply chain impacts and a COVID-19 resurgence in Greater China, combined with other factors, caused Inventories to grow to $8.4 billion, an increase of 23% compared to fiscal 2021.We also experienced elevated transportation, logistics and fulfillment costs as a result of this dynamic environment, which partially offset gross margin expansion in fiscal 2022.Inventory transit times as well as logistics and fulfillment costs are expected to remain elevated. We also expect product costs to remain elevated due to higher input costs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin could be negatively impacted by increased promotional activity to sell seasonal product arriving late due to the combination of temporary factory closures at the beginning of fiscal 2022 and continued elevated transit times. To mitigate the impact across our business, our teams are continuing to leverage our operational playbook and taking actions where we can, including balancing inventory across our geographies, pricing actions and employing a seasonless approach to products. Despite these short-term dynamics, we believe our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy continues to drive our business towards our long-term financial goals.During fiscal 2022, we continued to invest in our digital transformation and brand campaigns as the world returned to sport, and we expect to maintain our multi-year investment plans in order to transform our business of the future.2022 FORM 10-K 28Table of ContentsWe expect the operating environment could remain volatile in fiscal 2023 as there remains risk that COVID-19 variants may continue to cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse impact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability. For more information refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, within Part I, Item 1. Business.FISCAL 2022 OVERVIEWIn fiscal 2022, NIKE, Inc. achieved record Revenues of $46.7 billion, which increased 5% and 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by declines in Greater China. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 5% and 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, compared to fiscal 2021. NIKE Direct grew 14% and 15%, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, driven by an increase of 18% in NIKE Brand Digital, as growth in North America, APLA and EMEA was partially offset by a decline in Greater China. Wholesale revenues declined 1% as declines in North America and Greater China were partially offset by growth in EMEA and APLA. Revenues for Converse increased 6% and 7%, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, led by double-digit growth in our direct to consumer business, partially offset by lower wholesale revenues.Income before income taxes remained flat for fiscal 2022, as higher revenues and gross margin expansion were offset by higher selling and administrative expense. NIKE, Inc. gross margin increased 120 basis points, led by margin expansion in our NIKE Direct business, a higher mix of full-price sales and favorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges, partially offset by elevated freight and logistics costs and higher inventory obsolescence reserves primarily recognized in Greater China in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher Operating overhead and Demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to higher strategic technology investments as well as increases in wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct variable costs. This activity was partially offset by higher restructuring-related costs in the prior year related to our organizational realignment. For more information, see Note 21 — Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to normalization of spend against brand campaigns and continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. ROIC as of May 31, 2022 was 46.5% compared to 48.8% as of May 31, 2021. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for further information.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into separate definitive agreements to sell our legal entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as our legal entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of these entities will remain classified as held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. For more information related to our planned distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In future quarters, as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries, we expect consolidated NIKE, Inc. and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms. However, over time we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility. Economic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, impacted our local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected our ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. As a result, we deconsolidated our Russian legal entities, the net revenues of which were less than one percent of consolidated net Revenues for fiscal 2021. The deconsolidation of our Russian legal entities resulted in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $96 million recognized within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, we made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace.While foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics which have led to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability. We remain committed to effectively managing our business and mitigating financial market risks to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2021.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT, as well as EBIT Margin and ROIC, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated 2022 FORM 10-K 29 Table of Contentsusing actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. EBIT Margin is calculated as EBIT divided by total NIKE, Inc. Revenues. ROIC represents a performance measure that management believes is useful information in understanding the Company's ability to effectively manage invested capital, see the table below for how the Company calculates this measure.Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, ROIC, EBIT and EBIT margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.Our ROIC calculation as of May 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS ENDED(Dollars in millions)MAY 31, 2022MAY 31, 2021NumeratorNet income $6,046 $5,727 Add: Interest expense (income), net205 262 Add: Income tax expense605 934 Earnings before interest and taxes6,856 6,923 Income tax adjustment(1)(624)(970)Earnings before interest and after taxes$6,232 $5,953 AVERAGE FOR THE TRAILING FIVE QUARTERS ENDEDMAY 31, 2022MAY 31, 2021DenominatorTotal debt(2)$12,722 $12,890 Add: Shareholders' equity14,425 10,523 Less: Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments13,748 11,217 Total invested capital$13,399 $12,196 RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL46.5 %48.8 %(1)Equals Earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate as of the respective quarter end.(2)Total debt includes the following: 1) Current portion of long-term debt, 2) Notes Payable, 3) Current portion of operating lease liabilities, 4) Long-term debt and 5) Operating lease liabilities.2022 FORM 10-K 30Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS(Dollars in millions, except per share data)FISCAL 2022FISCAL 2021% CHANGEFISCAL 2020% CHANGERevenues$46,710 $44,538 5 %$37,403 19 %Cost of sales25,231 24,576 3 %21,162 16 %Gross profit21,479 19,962 8 %16,241 23 %Gross margin46.0 %44.8 %43.4 %Demand creation expense3,850 3,114 24 %3,592 -13 %Operating overhead expense10,954 9,911 11 %9,534 4 %Total selling and administrative expense14,804 13,025 14 %13,126 -1 %% of revenues31.7 %29.2 %35.1 %Interest expense (income), net205 262 — 89 — Other (income) expense, net(181)14 — 139 — Income before income taxes6,651 6,661 0 %2,887 131 %Income tax expense605 934 -35 %348 168 %Effective tax rate9.1 %14.0 %12.1 %NET INCOME$6,046 $5,727 6 %$2,539 126 %Diluted earnings per common share$3.75 $3.56 5 %$1.60 123 % 2022 FORM 10-K 31 Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSREVENUES(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2022FISCAL 2021% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)NIKE, Inc.

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, unisex products are classified within Men's, and Jordan Brand revenues are separately reported. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2022 presentation. These changes had no impact on previously reported consolidated results of operations or shareholders' equity. For additional information about the Consumer Direct Acceleration refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021.(5)Others include products not allocated to Men’s, Women’s, NIKE Kids’ and Jordan Brand, as well as certain adjustments that are not allocated to products designated by consumer.2022 FORM 10-K 32Table of ContentsFISCAL 2022 NIKE BRAND REVENUE HIGHLIGHTSThe following tables present NIKE Brand revenues disaggregated by reportable operating segment, distribution channel and major product line:FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by lower revenues in Greater China. Higher revenues in EMEA and North America each contributed approximately 3 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, and APLA contributed approximately 2 percentage points, while lower revenues in Greater China reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2022, driven by growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business. Unit sales of footwear decreased 3%, while higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and a higher mix of full-price sales.Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven primarily by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel remained flat, and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 42% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to 39% for fiscal 2021. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2022, driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 18%, comparable store sales growth of 10%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2022 NIKE Brand revenue growth of 6% was primarily driven by increases in Men's and the Jordan Brand, which grew 3% and 7%, respectively.2022 FORM 10-K 33 Table of ContentsGROSS MARGINFISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021For fiscal 2022, our consolidated gross profit increased 8% to $21,479 million compared to $19,962 million for fiscal 2021. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46.0% for fiscal 2022 compared to 44.8% for fiscal 2021 due to the following:*Wholesale equivalentThe increase in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher margin in our NIKE Direct business, a higher mix of full-price sales on a wholesale equivalent basis and favorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges. This activity was partially offset by higher product costs on a wholesale equivalent basis, largely due to elevated freight and logistics costs as well as an increase in other costs primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized in Greater China in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2022FISCAL 2021% CHANGEFISCAL 2020% CHANGEDemand creation expense(1)$3,850 $3,114 24 %$3,592 -13 %Operating overhead expense10,954 9,911 11 %9,534 4 %Total selling and administrative expense$14,804 $13,025 14 %$13,126 -1 %% of revenues31.7 %29.2 %250 bps35.1 %(590) bps(1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation.FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021Demand creation expense increased 24% for fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher advertising and marketing spend against brand campaigns as we experienced marketplace closures in the prior year due to COVID-19, as well as continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point.Operating overhead expense increased 11% for fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher strategic technology investments and increases in wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct variable costs. This activity was partially offset by higher restructuring-related costs in the prior year related to our organizational realignment. For more information, see Note 21 — Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on Operating overhead expense.OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2022FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020Other (income) expense, net$(181)$14 $139 Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021 Other (income) expense, net changed from $14 million of other expense, net in fiscal 2021 to $181 million of other income, net in the current year, primarily due to a $219 million net favorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges, as well as a net favorable impact related to our strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA, partially offset by the one-time charge related to the deconsolidation of our Russian operations.2022 FORM 10-K 34Table of ContentsFor more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses, and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $132 million for fiscal 2022.

The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.2022 FORM 10-K 35 Table of ContentsThe breakdown of Revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2022FISCAL 2021% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)North America$18,353 $17,179 7 %7 %$14,484 19 %19 %Europe, Middle East & Africa12,479 11,456 9 %12 %9,347 23 %17 %Greater China7,547 8,290 -9 %-13 %6,679 24 %19 %Asia Pacific & Latin America(2)5,955 5,343 11 %16 %5,028 6 %8 %Global Brand Divisions(3)102 25 308 %302 %30 -17 %-17 %TOTAL NIKE BRAND44,436 42,293 5 %6 %35,568 19 %17 %Converse2,346 2,205 6 %7 %1,846 19 %16 %Corporate(4)(72)40 — — (11)— — TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Higher product and other costs were primarily due to increased freight, logistics and warehousing costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily as a result of higher advertising and marketing expense, as well as higher digital marketing investments.

Gross margin decreased approximately 390 basis points, reflecting impacts from COVID-19 related government restrictions which reduced physical retail traffic and led to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was also largely due to higher product costs and lower NIKE Direct margins. This activity was partially offset by favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense.

The increase was due to higher revenues across nearly all territories, driven by SOCO (which comprises Argentina, Chile and Uruguay), Mexico and Korea, which increased 58%, 35% and 16%, respectively. Revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues in Men’s and Women's. NIKE Direct revenues increased 30%, primarily due to digital sales growth of 51% and comparable store sales growth of 13%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, partially offset by store closures.Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 17% for fiscal 2022 in part due to higher revenues in Women's and Men's. Unit sales of footwear increased 2%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 15 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher NIKE Direct ASP, higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, higher off-price ASP and a higher mix of full-price sales. Higher ASPs, in part, reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2022 due primarily to higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 3%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 9 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct and off-price ASPs. Higher ASPs, in part, reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.Reported EBIT increased 24% for fiscal 2022, as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 400 basis points primarily due to higher margins and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP largely due to lower discounts, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower other costs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to lower warehousing costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to higher digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand. The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily due to an increase in NIKE Direct variable expenses as well as higher bad debt expense.2022 FORM 10-K 40Table of ContentsGLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2022FISCAL 2021% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues$102 $25 308 %302 %$30 -17 %-17 %Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes$(4,262)$(3,656)-17 %$(3,468)-5 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expense, including product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.2022 FORM 10-K 42Table of ContentsTRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.2022 FORM 10-K 43 Table of ContentsCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement, and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $295 million, a benefit of approximately $893 million and a detriment of approximately $867 million for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $87 million, a benefit of approximately $260 million and a detriment of approximately $212 million for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar. As of and for the period ended May 31, 2022, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition, and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates.MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had favorable impacts of approximately $132 million and $19 million and an unfavorable impact of approximately $91 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIESWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2022 and 2021. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.2022 FORM 10-K 44Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOW ACTIVITYCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $5,188 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $6,657 million for fiscal 2021. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,848 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2022 compared to $6,612 million for fiscal 2021. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations of $1,660 million for fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of $45 million for fiscal 2021. The net change in working capital was unfavorably impacted by a $2,183 million increase in Inventories, partially offset by a favorable impact from a $1,102 million decrease in Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to supply chain constraints, which caused higher levels of in-transit inventory and therefore a lower supply of available inventory to meet consumer demand. Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $1,524 million for fiscal 2022, compared to an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2022, the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $747 million compared to a cash outflow of $3,276 million in fiscal 2021. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. In future periods, we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues.Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $4,836 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021. This change was driven by our resumption of the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in $4,014 million of share repurchases during fiscal 2022 compared to $608 million during fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, we purchased 27.3 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $3,994 million (an average price of $146.11 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2022, we had repurchased 77.4 million shares at a cost of $8,663 million (an average price of $111.98 per share) under this program. In June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new four-year, $18 billion program to repurchase shares of the Company's Class B common stock. The new program will replace the current $15 billion share repurchase program, which will be terminated in fiscal 2023. Repurchases under the new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. CAPITAL RESOURCESOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022, and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2022. On March 11, 2022, we entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 10, 2023, with an option to extend the maturity date an additional 364 days. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 15, 2021, which would have matured on March 14, 2022. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.On March 11, 2022, we also entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 11, 2027, with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion five-year credit facility agreement entered into on August 16, 2019, which would have matured on August 16, 2024. Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 11, 2022, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and 2022 FORM 10-K 45 Table of Contentspayable. As of May 31, 2022, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $3 billion program. As of May 31, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding.We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs.To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.As of May 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $13.0 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2022, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 113 days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.Our material cash requirements as of May 31, 2022, were as follows:•Debt Obligations — Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.•Operating Leases — Refer to Note 19 — Leases in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.•Endorsement Contracts — As of May 31, 2022, we had endorsement contract obligations of $7.6 billion, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months, representing approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than these amounts as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors and the contracts generally do not stipulate a minimum amount of cash to be spent on the product.•Product Purchase Obligations — As of May 31, 2022, we had product purchase obligations of $6.6 billion, all of which are payable within the next 12 months. Product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.•Other Purchase Obligations — As of May 31, 2022, we had $3.1 billion of other purchase obligations, with $1.7 billion payable within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations primarily include technology investments, construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, and may include open purchase orders for non-product purchases. In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. As a part of the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as of May 31, 2022, we had $730 million in estimated future cash payments, with $86 million payable within the next 12 months. These amounts represent the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which are reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEWNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which is comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as ""NIKE Brand Digital""), to wholesale accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in nearly all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, ""must-have"" products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.Through the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, we are focused on creating the marketplace of the future with more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale partners. In addition, our product creation and marketing organizations are aligned to a consumer construct focused on sports dimensions through Men's, Women's and Kids', which allows us to better serve consumer needs. We continue to invest in a new Enterprise Resource Planning Platform, data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we believe will further accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS •In fiscal 2023, NIKE, Inc. achieved record Revenues of $51.2 billion, which increased 10% and 16% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively •NIKE Direct revenues grew 14% from $18.7 billion in fiscal 2022 to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023, and represented approximately 44% of total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2023•Gross margin for the fiscal year decreased 250 basis points to 43.5% primarily driven by higher product costs, higher markdowns and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by strategic pricing actions•Inventories as of May 31, 2023 were $8.5 billion, flat compared to the prior year, driven by the actions we took throughout fiscal 2023 to manage inventory levels•We returned $7.5 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2023 through share repurchases and dividends•Return on Invested Capital (""ROIC"") as of May 31, 2023 was 31.5% compared to 46.5% as of May 31, 2022. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for further information.For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 21, 2022.CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MARKET DYNAMICS •Consumer Spending: Our fiscal 2023 growth in Revenues reflects strong demand for our products despite ongoing uncertainty in the global economy. We will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including potential impacts of inflation and rising interest rates on consumer behavior. •Inflationary Pressures: Inflationary pressures, including higher product input, freight and logistics costs negatively impacted gross margin for fiscal 2023. The strategic pricing actions we have taken partially offset the impacts of these higher costs.•Supply Chain Volatility: Supply chain challenges, macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the manufacturing of our product disrupted the flow of seasonal product in fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, resulting in elevated inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Throughout fiscal 2023, we took action to reduce excess inventory by decreasing future inventory purchases and increasing promotional activity. These actions, along with the stabilization of inventory transit times in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023, resulted in the normalization of the seasonal flow of product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.2023 FORM 10-K 28Table of Contents•COVID-19 Impacts in Greater China: During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we managed through continued temporary store closures and reduced retail traffic in Greater China, primarily due to COVID-19 related local government restrictions. At the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the government mandated restrictions were lifted and we experienced improvement in physical retail traffic. •Foreign Currency Impacts: As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, we are exposed to risk arising from foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported Revenues by approximately $2,859 million, reducing our revenue growth rate to 10% on a reported basis from 16% on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedges, also reduced our reported Income before income taxes by approximately $1,023 million. For further information, refer to ""Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices"".The operating environment could remain volatile in fiscal 2024 as the risk exists that worsening macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue growth as well as overall profitability. For more information refer to Item 1A Risk Factors, within Part I, Item 1. Business.RECENT DEVELOPMENTSDuring the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our entity in Chile and our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to third-party distributors, respectively. Now that we have completed the shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor model within our Central and South America (""CASA"") territory, we expect consolidated NIKE, Inc. and Asia Pacific & Latin America (""APLA"") revenue growth will be reduced due to different commercial terms. However, over time we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well as reduce exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. References to these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends.

Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period in place of the exchange rates in use during the current period.Wholesale equivalent revenues: References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. COMPARABLE STORE SALESComparable store sales: This key metric, which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.2023 FORM 10-K 30Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS(Dollars in millions, except per share data)FISCAL 2023FISCAL 2022% CHANGEFISCAL 2021% CHANGERevenues$51,217 $46,710 10 %$44,538 5 %Cost of sales28,925 25,231 15 %24,576 3 %Gross profit22,292 21,479 4 %19,962 8 %Gross margin43.5 %46.0 %44.8 %Demand creation expense4,060 3,850 5 %3,114 24 %Operating overhead expense12,317 10,954 12 %9,911 11 %Total selling and administrative expense16,377 14,804 11 %13,025 14 %% of revenues32.0 %31.7 %29.2 %Interest expense (income), net(6)205 — 262 — Other (income) expense, net(280)(181)— 14 — Income before income taxes6,201 6,651 -7 %6,661 0 %Income tax expense1,131 605 87 %934 -35 %Effective tax rate18.2 %9.1 %14.0 %NET INCOME$5,070 $6,046 -16 %$5,727 6 %Diluted earnings per common share$3.23 $3.75 -14 %$3.56 5 % 2023 FORM 10-K 31 Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTSREVENUES(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2023FISCAL 2022% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)FISCAL 2021% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)NIKE, Inc.

Revenues were $51.2 billion in fiscal 2023, which increased 10% and 16% compared to fiscal 2022 on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively. The increase was due to higher revenues in North America, Europe, Middle East & Africa (""EMEA""), APLA and Greater China, which contributed approximately 7, 6, 2 and 1 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, respectively. •NIKE Brand revenues, which represented over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 10% and 16% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues in Men's, the Jordan Brand, Women's and Kids' which grew 17%, 35%,11% and 10%, respectively, on a wholesale equivalent basis. •NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 20% on a currency-neutral basis, due to higher revenues in Men's, the Jordan Brand, Women's and Kids'. Unit sales of footwear increased 13%, while higher average selling price (""ASP"") per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct business, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP. •NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct business, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity.•NIKE Direct revenues increased 14% from $18.7 billion in fiscal 2022 to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 20% primarily driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 24%, comparable store sales growth of 14% and the addition of new stores. For further information regarding comparable store sales, including the definition, see ""Comparable Store Sales"". NIKE Brand Digital sales were $12.6 billion for fiscal 2023 compared to $10.7 billion for fiscal 2022.2023 FORM 10-K 33 Table of ContentsGROSS MARGINFISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022For fiscal 2023, our consolidated gross profit increased 4% to $22,292 million compared to $21,479 million for fiscal 2022. Gross margin decreased 250 basis points to 43.5% for fiscal 2023 compared to 46.0% for fiscal 2022 due to the following:*Wholesale equivalentThe decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to:•Higher NIKE Brand product costs, on a wholesale equivalent basis, primarily due to higher input costs and elevated inbound freight and logistics costs as well as product mix;•Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business, driven by higher promotional activity to liquidate inventory in the current period compared to lower promotional activity in the prior period resulting from lower available inventory supply;•Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges; and•Lower off-price margin, on a wholesale equivalent basis.This was partially offset by:•Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, due primarily to strategic pricing actions and product mix; and•Lower other costs, primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized in Greater China in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2023FISCAL 2022% CHANGEFISCAL 2021% CHANGEDemand creation expense(1)$4,060 $3,850 5 %$3,114 24 %Operating overhead expense12,317 10,954 12 %9,911 11 %Total selling and administrative expense$16,377 $14,804 11 %$13,025 14 %% of revenues32.0 %31.7 %30 bps29.2 %250 bps(1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation.FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022Demand creation expense increased 5% for fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense and higher sports marketing expense.

This increase was partially offset by net unfavorable activity related to our strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA, including the loss recognized upon the completion of the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 18 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses, and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $1,023 million for fiscal 2023.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICESOVERVIEWAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (""NTC"") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.2023 FORM 10-K 42Table of ContentsRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (""factory currency exposure index"") in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (""factory input costs"") are denominated.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. •Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.2023 FORM 10-K 43 Table of ContentsCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability being hedged. TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $2,859 million, $295 million and a benefit of approximately $893 million for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $824 million, $87 million and a benefit of approximately $260 million for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""). We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $1,023 million and a favorable impact of approximately $132 million and $19 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIESWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOW ACTIVITYCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $5,841 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $5,188 million for fiscal 2022. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,354 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2023, compared to $6,848 million for fiscal 2022. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations of $513 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a decrease of $1,660 million for fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2023, the net change in working capital compared to the prior year was impacted by unfavorable changes in Accounts payable, offset by favorable impacts from Inventories and Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to reduced inventory purchases in the current period and timing of wholesale shipments. Further impacting these changes was a lower available supply of inventory in the prior year due to supply chain constraints. Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $564 million for fiscal 2023, compared to an outflow of $1,524 million for fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments. For fiscal 2023, the net change in short-term 2023 FORM 10-K 44Table of Contentsinvestments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $1,481 million compared to a cash outflow of $747 million for fiscal 2022. Additionally, we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $7,447 million for fiscal 2023 compared to an outflow of $4,836 million for fiscal 2022. The increased outflow in fiscal 2023 was driven by higher share repurchases of $5,480 million for fiscal 2023 compared to $4,014 million for fiscal 2022, the repayment of $500 million of senior notes that matured in fiscal 2023, as well as lower proceeds from stock option exercises, which resulted in a cash inflow of $651 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $1,151 million in fiscal 2022.In fiscal 2023, we purchased a total of 50.0 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $5.5 billion (an average price of $110.32 per share). In August 2022, we terminated the previous four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. Under this program, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for a total approximate cost of $710.0 million (an average price of $109.85 per share) during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 83.8 million shares for a total approximate cost of $9.4 billion (an average price of $111.82 per share) during the term of the program. Upon termination of the four-year, $15 billion program, we began purchasing shares under the new four-year, $18 billion share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of May 31, 2023, we had repurchased 43.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $4.8 billion (an average price of $110.38 per share) under this new program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.CAPITAL RESOURCESOn July 21, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement (the ""Shelf"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 21, 2025.On March 11, 2022, we entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 11, 2027, with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion five-year credit facility agreement entered into on August 16, 2019, which would have matured on August 16, 2024. Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information. On March 10, 2023, we entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 8, 2024, with an option to extend the maturity date by 364 days. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 11, 2022, which matured on March 10, 2023. Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 11, 2022 and March 10, 2023, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on the disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the applicable syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2023, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants, and we believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $3 billion program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the capital or credit markets; however, future volatility may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.As of May 31, 2023, we had Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments totaling $10.7 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2023, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 98 days.2023 FORM 10-K 45 Table of ContentsWe believe that existing Cash and equivalents, Short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.Our material cash requirements as of May 31, 2023, were as follows:•Debt Obligations — Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 6 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.•Operating Leases — Refer to Note 17 — Leases in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.•Endorsement Contracts — As of May 31, 2023, we had endorsement contract obligations of $7.6 billion, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months, representing approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than these amounts as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors and the contracts generally do not stipulate a minimum amount of cash to be spent on the product.•Product Purchase Obligations — As of May 31, 2023, we had product purchase obligations of $6.4 billion, all of which are payable within the next 12 months. Product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.•Other Purchase Obligations — As of May 31, 2023, we had $3.3 billion of other purchase obligations, with $1.7 billion payable within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations primarily include technology investments, construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, and may include open purchase orders for non-product purchases. In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 7 — Income Taxes and Note 11 — Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. As a part of the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as of May 31, 2023, we had $644 million in estimated future cash payments, with $161 million payable within the next 12 months. These amounts represent the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which are reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized.Refer to Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our off-balance sheet arrangements, bank guarantees and letters of credit. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of May 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current and future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards.2023 FORM 10-K 46Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Within the context of these critical accounting estimates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.SALES-RELATED RESERVESProvisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.Refer to Note 14 — Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. INVENTORY RESERVESWe make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVESWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.2023 FORM 10-K 47 Table of ContentsINCOME TAXESWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. Refer to Note 7 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.OTHER CONTINGENCIESIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations related to our business, products and actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property and other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Refer to Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 2023 FORM 10-K 48Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2023, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.MARKET RISK MEASUREMENTWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (""VaR""). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a ""variance/co-variance"" technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the ""delta"" and ""gamma"") to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $111 million and $99 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $289 million and $170 million during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward 2023 FORM 10-K 49 Table of Contentscontracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE-owned retail stores, independent distributors and licensees, in the United States and over 160 countries worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable portfolio of global footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories brands. Our strategy for building this portfolio is focused in four key areas: • Deepening our relationship with consumers; • Delivering superior, innovative products to the marketplace; • Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline and excellence; and • Accelerating growth through focused execution. By executing this strategy, we aim to deliver the following long-term financial goals: • High single digit revenue growth; • Mid-teens earnings per share growth; • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows; and • Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. 14 Table of Contents In fiscal 2005 we met or surpassed these financial goals. Our revenues grew 12% to $13.7 billion, net income grew 28% to $1.2 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.48, a 28% increase versus fiscal 2004. The impact of foreign currency changes has had a favorable impact on this year’s consolidated results of operations, primarily as a contributor to the growth in our gross margin percentage. For fiscal 2005, our consolidated gross margin percentage increased 160 basis points to 44.5%. Additionally, we have improved our return on invested capital, increased free cash flow from operations and continued to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Although in any particular quarter or fiscal year we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above, we continue to believe these are appropriate long-term goals.

Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth, as all three of our international regions posted higher revenues. The U.S. Region contributed 3 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005. Sales in our Other businesses operating segment drove the remainder of the improvement of consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005. Converse, a component of the Other businesses, was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The comparison of a full year of results in fiscal 2005 versus a partial year in fiscal 2004 contributed 1 percentage point to the consolidated revenue growth. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 15 — Acquisitions) for additional information related to the acquisition. During fiscal 2005, our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 160 basis points versus the prior year, from 42.9% to 44.5%. The primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2005 were as follows: (1) Higher gross margins in our international regions, driven primarily by our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Region, accounted for 90 basis points of the overall margin improvement in fiscal 2005. This improvement was driven by changes in currency hedge rates, primarily the euro, partially offset by lower in-line pricing margins (net revenue for current product offerings minus product costs) and a higher percentage of less profitable closeout sales (non-current 15 Table of Contents product offerings), the result of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions (as discussed below): (a) Year-over-year hedge rate improvements contributed approximately 170 basis points to the fiscal 2005 consolidated gross margin percentage improvement. We have hedged the majority of product purchases for fiscal 2006 and a significant portion of those are at more favorable rates than product purchases in fiscal 2005. Based on these hedge rates, we expect hedge rates to have a positive impact on our gross margin percentage during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, with the greater impact occurring during the first half of the year. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives) for additional information on hedges. (b) Lower in-line pricing margins in EMEA and Asia Pacific were due to strategies to improve product value in these regions. In addition, increased levels of closeout sales and lower closeout pricing, the result of the liquidation of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories this year, reduced the overall gross margin percentage improvement in those regions. Together, these factors resulted in a reduction in the consolidated gross margin percentage of about 60 basis points for fiscal 2005. (2) Higher gross margins in the U.S. Region contributed approximately 30 basis points to the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal 2005. Fewer, more profitable closeouts in footwear drove the improvement partially offset by increased sales discounts (the result of increased sales to high volume accounts) and higher product costs and air freight incurred to meet strong footwear demand. (3) Improved gross margin percentages in our Other businesses represented 30 basis points of improvement for fiscal 2005. The addition of Converse (acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2004) and Exeter Brands Group (formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005) drove the gross margin percentage improvement. Both Exeter Brands Group and the international portion of Converse’s business operate on a licensing model, which carries higher gross margins and lower operating expenses than the remainder of our Other businesses. Fiscal 2005 selling and administrative expense, comprised of demand creation and operating overhead, grew 14% versus fiscal 2004. Three percentage points of the increase for fiscal 2005 were due to changes in currency exchange rates. The impact of a full fiscal year for Converse and the formation of Exeter Brands Group added one percentage point of growth. Demand creation (advertising and promotion) expense grew 16% to $1,600.7 million in fiscal 2005. Three percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and events primarily in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions (5 percentage points), higher advertising spending primarily in the EMEA Region (3 percentage points), and incremental investment in retail marketing in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions (2 percentage points). The addition of Converse and formation of Exeter Brands Group contributed 2 percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year. Operating overhead for fiscal 2005 was $2,621.0 million, a 13% increase over fiscal 2004. Changes in currency exchange rates contributed 3 percentage points of the increase. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, operating overhead increases for fiscal 2005 were mainly attributable to higher personnel costs due to increased headcount, higher wages and benefits and increased incentive-based compensation for employees (4 percentage points), investments in emerging markets (such as China, India and our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit) and our Other businesses (3 percentage points), increased costs due to sales and leadership events (2 percentage points) and investments in NIKE-owned retail stores (1 percentage point). 16 Table of Contents The most significant component of other expense, net, of $29.1 million for fiscal 2005 was foreign currency hedge losses. These losses are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information). The hedge losses reflect that the euro has strengthened since we entered into these hedge contracts. In fiscal 2004, foreign currency hedge losses were also the most significant component of other expense, net, of $74.7 million. The year-over-year improvement in other expense, net, for fiscal 2005 was mainly due to lower foreign currency hedge losses and lower net losses on asset disposals compared to those recorded in fiscal 2004. In 2005, net foreign currency losses in other expense, net, were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in EMEA. Our estimate of the combined impact of lower foreign currency conversion losses and the favorable translation of foreign-currency denominated profits is a $95 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year. If current exchange rates remain constant, we do not expect a significant impact on our consolidated income before income taxes related to foreign currency gains or losses and the offsetting translation for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 34.9%, which is slightly higher than the fiscal 2004 rate of 34.8% primarily due to decreases in tax credits partially offset by lower taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal 2005. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we decided to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings during fiscal 2006 under the American Jobs Creation Act (the “Act), which was signed into law by the President on October 22, 2004. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. by providing an 85% dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. We elected to repatriate a combination of foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes had previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the provisions made did not have a material impact on our income tax expense or our effective tax rate for the year. Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2005 were 9.5% higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2004. Approximately 1 point of this reported increase was due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year. Excluding this currency impact, slightly higher average selling prices for both footwear and apparel contributed 1 point of the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The remaining increase was due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel. As always, the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team apparel, Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands. 17 Table of Contents Operating Segments The breakdown of revenues follows: FY05 vs. FY04 vs. FY04 FY03 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004* % CHG Fiscal 2003* % CHG (Dollars in millions) U.S. Region Footwear $ 3,358.2 $ 3,070.4 9 % $ 3,019.5 2 % Apparel 1,457.7 1,433.5 2 % 1,351.0 6 % Equipment 313.4 277.9 13 % 266.9 4 % Total U.S. 5,129.3 4,781.8 7 % 4,637.4 3 % EMEA Region Footwear 2,500.0 2,232.2 12 % 1,896.0 18 % Apparel 1,497.1 1,333.8 12 % 1,133.1 18 % Equipment 284.5 261.7 9 % 192.4 36 % Total EMEA 4,281.6 3,827.7 12 % 3,221.5 19 % Asia Pacific Region Footwear 962.9 855.3 13 % 730.6 17 % Apparel 755.5 612.3 23 % 497.8 23 % Equipment 178.9 143.2 25 % 112.2 28 % Total Asia Pacific 1,897.3 1,610.8 18 % 1,340.6 20 % Americas Region Footwear 478.6 408.2 17 % 334.8 22 % Apparel 169.1 159.5 6 % 143.2 11 % Equipment 48.1 36.8 31 % 31.1 18 % Total Americas 695.8 604.5 15 % 509.1 19 % 12,004.0 10,824.8 11 % 9,708.6 11 % Other 1,735.7 1,428.3 22 % 988.4 45 % Total Revenues $ 13,739.7 $ 12,253.1 12 % $ 10,697.0 15 % * Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2005 presentation. The discussion following includes disclosure of “pre-tax income” for our operating segments. We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” As discussed in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre-tax income of our operating segments. For EMEA, changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 7 percentage points of the reported revenue growth in fiscal 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, EMEA Region revenues grew 5 percent as each product business unit (footwear, apparel and equipment) experienced growth. The following analysis excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency. The increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increased unit sales of footwear, apparel and equipment partially offset by declines in the average prices in each of the business units. Although apparel and equipment business units experienced growth for fiscal 2005, revenues fell slightly in the fourth quarter primarily due to comparisons to very strong sales in the prior year’s fourth quarter related to the 2004 European Football Championships. For fiscal 2005, sales increases in the emerging markets in our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit, along with sales increases in the UK and Italy, drove the growth. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in France, Germany and Northern Europe. 18 Table of Contents For the EMEA Region, futures orders scheduled for delivery from June through November 2005 were 7 percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal 2004. Changes in currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of this growth. Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, the growth was driven by an increase in the region’s footwear and apparel unit orders and increases in apparel’s average price. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the region’s footwear average price per pair, partially due to strategies to improve the product value. EMEA pre-tax income for fiscal 2005 was $917.5 million, up 23% versus the prior year. Higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase, more than offsetting increased selling and administrative costs. The improved gross margins, which contributed 90 basis points of growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage, were primarily the result of improved year-over-year hedge rates partially offset by reduced in-line pricing margins and higher, less profitable closeout sales. In the Asia Pacific Region, 4 percentage points of reported revenue growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates. The following analysis excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency. Sales in each Asia Pacific product business unit grew versus fiscal 2004 with the growth primarily due to unit volume; average price per unit increased slightly. Significant revenue increases in China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) and increases in every other country in the region except Australia and New Zealand were the key growth drivers for fiscal 2005. For the Asia Pacific Region, futures orders scheduled for delivery from June through November 2005 were 11 percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal 2004. Changes in currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of this growth. Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, the growth was driven by an increase in the region’s footwear and apparel unit orders. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the region’s average selling price per unit for footwear and apparel. Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region increased 13% versus fiscal 2004 to $399.8 million. Higher revenues were partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased selling and administrative costs. The reduced gross margin percentage, which had a minimal negative impact on the net overall consolidated gross margin percentage change, was primarily attributable to less profitable closeout sales and reduced in-line pricing margins due to strategies to improve the product value, partially offset by better year-over-year currency hedge rates. In the Americas Region, 1 percentage point of the revenue growth for fiscal 2005 was due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency, sales in each Americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2005. The revenue growth was driven primarily by higher sales in Central and South America, partially offset by lower sales in Canada. In fiscal 2005, pre-tax income for the Americas Region increased 21% from the prior year, to $117.6 million. The increase in pre-tax income was attributable to higher revenues and an improved gross margin percentage, partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs. The improved gross margin percentage had a minimal impact on the consolidated gross margin percentage improvement. In the U.S. Region, revenues for fiscal 2005 grew 7% versus fiscal 2004, as revenues increased in each product business unit. The increase in footwear revenue was due to a 5 percentage point increase in unit sales and a 4 percentage point increase in the average price per pair. The increases in unit sales and the average price per pair are due to increased consumer demand for performance products, especially those with a suggested retail price over $100. The increase in apparel sales for fiscal 2005 was driven by volume increases in branded apparel, partially offset by a decline in revenue from sales of licensed apparel. The decline in revenue from licensed apparel was due to the expiration of our license agreement with the NBA, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, and a shift in consumer preference towards branded apparel. For the first quarter and into the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we expect revenues generated by licensed apparel to be below the prior year levels due to the expiration of the agreement with the NBA. 19 Table of Contents For the U.S. Region, futures orders scheduled for delivery from June through November 2005 increased 9 percentage points versus the same period of the prior year. Futures orders increased due to unit growth for both footwear and apparel and higher average price per pair for footwear. As discussed above, these reported futures do not cover all components of our overall revenues, such as U.S. licensed apparel (expected to decrease as noted above), equipment, closeouts, at-once orders and retail sales. As a result, revenue growth for the U.S. Region for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 is expected to be below the reported futures growth. For fiscal 2005, pre-tax income for the U.S. Region was $1,125.8 million, a 12% increase versus fiscal 2004. Higher revenues and improved gross margin percentage drove the increase, more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs. The improved gross margin percentage contributed 30 basis points of growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage growth and was primarily the result of fewer, more profitable closeouts partially offset by increased discounts and higher product costs and air freight incurred to meet strong footwear demand. Revenues and pre-tax income for our Other businesses in fiscal 2005 include results from Bauer NIKE Hockey Inc., Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf and Exeter Brands Group LLC. Exeter Brands Group LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of NIKE, Inc., formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to develop the Company’s business in retail channels serving value-conscious consumers and to operate the business obtained in the acquisition of Official Starter Properties LLC and Official Starter LLC (collectively “Official Starter”). For fiscal 2005, the addition of Converse, acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, and the formation of Exeter Brands Group together drove 12 percentage points of the Other business revenue increase of 22% over fiscal 2004. The remainder of the increase was driven by revenue growth at Cole Haan, NIKE Golf and Hurley. Pre-tax income from the Other businesses improved to $153.9 million in fiscal 2005, versus income of $75.3 million in fiscal 2004. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the addition of Converse, improved results from Cole Haan and Bauer and the formation of the Exeter Brands Group. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Consolidated Operating Results In fiscal 2004, consolidated revenues grew 15% versus fiscal 2003; seven percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the stronger euro. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 3 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth and all three of our international regions posted higher revenues, with our Asia Pacific Region making the largest contribution. Converse, which was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004, contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth. Improved sales in the U.S. Region and increases in our Other businesses drove the balance of the consolidated revenue growth. During fiscal 2004, our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 190 basis points versus the prior year, from 41.0% to 42.9%. The primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004 were as follows: (1) Changes in hedge rates, primarily the euro, represented 70 basis points of improvement for fiscal 2004. The positive impact of hedge rates on the fiscal 2004 gross margin percentage was most significant in the fourth quarter, contributing 140 basis points of the year-over-year quarterly improvement. (2) Higher in-line pricing margins drove approximately 70 basis points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004. This was primarily attributable to improved footwear margins as a result of lower product costs due to manufacturing efficiencies, reduced materials costs and lower air freight. (3) Improved profitability on wholesale closeout sales, primarily in the U.S. and EMEA regions due to improved closeout pricing margins, partially offset by increased obsolescence reserves due to a less favorable mix of product remaining in closeout inventory. These factors 20 Table of Contents represented approximately 10 basis points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004. (4) Most of the remaining increase was due to improved gross margin percentages for NIKE-owned retail stores in the U.S. and EMEA regions, which contributed approximately 30 basis points of the improvement in consolidated gross margins for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 selling and administrative expense grew 17% versus fiscal 2003. Demand creation expense grew 18% to $1,377.9 million in fiscal 2004. Seven percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on endorsement contracts in the U.S., primarily basketball (3 percentage point impact), incremental investment in retail marketing in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions (3 percentage point impact), and higher advertising spending in the Asia Pacific region (1 percentage point impact). The addition of Converse contributed 2 percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year. Operating overhead for fiscal 2004 was $2,324.1 million, a 17% increase over fiscal 2003. Currency exchange rates contributed 5 percentage points of the increase. The addition of Converse accounted for 2 percentage points of growth. Other key factors driving the increase in operating overhead for the fiscal year were: (a) increased incentive-based compensation for employees (3 percentage points); and (b) increased costs to support the growth of our NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Bauer NIKE Hockey and Hurley businesses (2 percentage points). The remaining increase, about 5 percentage points, is primarily attributable to normal wage increases and some added infrastructure necessary to support global business growth, including costs related to our worldwide supply chain initiative and additional factory outlet stores in the EMEA Region. Other expense, net, was $74.7 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $77.5 million in fiscal 2003. In both years, the most significant component of other expense, net, was foreign currency hedge losses. The hedge losses reflect that the euro strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts. Also included in other expense, net, for fiscal 2004 was an increase in net losses on asset disposals, including a loss of $5.3 million on land gifted to the NIKE Foundation in the first quarter. In 2004, net foreign currency losses in other expense, net, were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in EMEA. Our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a $157 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 34.8%, which is higher than the fiscal 2003 rate of 34.1% as a result of a higher tax provision on foreign earnings in fiscal 2004. Included in net income for fiscal 2003 was a $266.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” (FAS 142). This charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with Bauer NIKE Hockey and the goodwill of Cole Haan, reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 4 — Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill) for further information. Operating Segments For EMEA, changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 17 percentage points of the reported increase in revenues in fiscal 2004. The remaining increase over the prior year was primarily driven by NIKE-owned retail (due to the addition of new stores in fiscal 2004) and increased footwear volume (led by soccer products). Excluding the impact of currency exchange movements, sales in each EMEA business unit grew versus fiscal 2003. EMEA pre-tax income for fiscal 2004 was $744.0 million, up 43% versus the prior year. Higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase, more than offsetting incremental selling and 21 Table of Contents administrative costs. The improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved year-over-year hedge rates and higher in-line and closeout pricing margins. In the Asia Pacific Region, fiscal 2004 revenues increased 20% year-over-year. Eight percentage points of growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of currency exchange movements, sales in each Asia Pacific business unit grew versus fiscal 2003. The region’s revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases, with significant revenue growth in China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) and Japan (driven by strong consumer demand). Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region increased to $352.3 million in fiscal 2004, up 22% versus fiscal 2003. Higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase, more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs. The higher gross margins were primarily attributable to higher in-line pricing margins and the benefit of better hedge rates on product purchases, partially offset by lower profitability of closeouts. In the Americas Region, revenues increased 19% compared to fiscal 2003, with 8 percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the currency effects, the revenue growth was driven primarily by stronger consumer demand in South America and sales in each Americas business unit grew versus fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, pre-tax income for the Americas Region increased 6% from the prior year, to $97.4 million. The increase in pre-tax income was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates slightly offset by reduced gross margins and higher selling and administrative costs. Gross margins fell due to lower in-line pricing margins as well as weaker currency exchange rates in Mexico. In the U.S. Region, revenues for fiscal 2004 grew 3% versus fiscal 2003, as revenues increased in each business unit. The increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in sport performance product and increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel primarily in the first half of fiscal 2004. The increase in footwear revenue was due to an increase in average wholesale selling price per pair and increased sales in NIKE-owned retail stores, partially offset by a slight decline in wholesale unit sales. The increase in average wholesale selling price per pair was partially due to a larger percentage of sales of products with a suggested retail price over $100. The slight decline in U.S. footwear wholesale unit sales was largely due to changes in distribution to several retail customers. For the first half of the year, sales to our largest customer, Foot Locker, were lower as a result of changes to our distribution strategy implemented in fiscal 2002 and 2003; while the decline in first half sales resulted in slightly lower sales for the full year, our year-over-year sales to Foot Locker grew in the second half of fiscal 2004. In addition, fiscal 2004 sales declined for another large customer, Footstar, which declared bankruptcy in March 2004. The sales declines for Foot Locker and Footstar were partially offset by increased sales to other accounts. For fiscal 2004, pre-tax income for the U.S. Region was $1,007.3 million, a 6% increase versus fiscal 2003. Higher revenues and gross margins drove the increase, more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs. The improved gross margins were primarily the result of higher in-line and closeout pricing margins and expanded retail margins. Revenues for Other businesses grew 45% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003; the addition of Converse contributed 23 percentage points of the increase. The remainder of the increase was due to revenue growth at NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Hurley and Bauer NIKE Hockey. Pre-tax income for Other businesses improved to $75.3 million in fiscal 2004, versus income of $7.9 million in fiscal 2003. The addition of Converse, combined with improved results from NIKE Golf and Cole Haan, drove the year-over-year improvement. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2005 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.6 billion in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2004. Our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of $1.2 billion. In fiscal 2005, cash provided by operations was not significantly affected by the net change in working capital. In fiscal 2004, a net decrease in working capital provided $193.2 million in cash flow primarily due to improved cash management of our accounts receivable and timing of inventory receipts and vendor payments. Cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was $360.4 million, compared to $950.6 million invested during fiscal 2004. The most significant uses of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2005 were net additions to property, plant and equipment of $250 million, and a net increase in short-term investments (purchases partially offset by the maturities). The additions to property, plant and equipment reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software (to support both normal business operations and our supply chain systems upgrade), and continued investment in NIKE-owned retail stores. The improvement over the prior year was primarily due to lower net purchases of short-term investments and lower costs associated with the acquisition of subsidiaries. In fiscal 2005 and since inception of our current share repurchase program, we purchased approximately 6.9 million shares of NIKE’s Class B common stock for $556.2 million. The share repurchases were part of a four-year $1.5 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2004. We expect to continue to fund this program from operating cash flow. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2005 were $0.95, compared to $0.74 in fiscal 2004. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. Our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20% to 30% of the trailing twelve-months’ earnings per share paid out on a quarterly basis. We review our dividend policy from time to time, and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations Our long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2005 are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ended May 31, Description of Commitment 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 186.7 $ 157.6 $ 135.3 $ 112.9 $ 97.8 $ 556.3 $ 1,246.6 Long-term Debt 6.2 256.2 31.2 6.2 31.2 353.5 684.5 Endorsement Contracts(1) 400.3 405.0 276.9 182.3 102.9 317.6 1,685.0 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 1,858.2 2.8 — — — — 1,861.0 Other(3) 250.5 75.9 26.1 25.5 2.1 1.3 381.4 Total $ 2,701.9 $ 897.5 $ 469.5 $ 326.9 $ 234.0 $ 1,228.7 $ 5,858.5 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product 23 Table of Contents provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through fiscal 2006. The amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services. If we were to terminate the entire contract as of May 31, 2005, we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of $13.4 million. Our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate $7 million. Subsequent to May 31, 2005, we extended this contract through fiscal 2008 with substantially the same terms as noted above; however, the termination fee increased to approximately $19 million upon execution of the renewed contract and our estimated monthly payments decreased to approximately $6 million. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2005. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 — Short-term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as of May 31, 2005 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates, generally ninety days from issuance or on demand $ 69.8 Payable to Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America) for the purchase of inventories, generally due sixty days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 53.1 As of May 31, 2005, letters of credit of $555.0 million were outstanding, primarily for the purchase of inventory. All letters of credit generally expire within one year. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under which $1 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium-term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500 million in medium-term notes, as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements. During fiscal 2005, there were no medium-term notes issued under the program. In previous years $240.0 million in medium-term notes were issued under the program. Currently, $760 million remains available to be issued under the shelf registration. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2006 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2005, we had a multi-year $750 million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks, and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility. The maturity date is November 20, 24 Table of Contents 2008 and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A2 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.18%. The facility fee is 0.07% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, and set a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2005, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2005 or May 31, 2004. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” (FAS 151). FAS 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. We are currently evaluating the provisions of FAS 151 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. On December 16, 2004, the FASB finalized SFAS No. 123R “Share Based Payment,” (FAS 123R) which, after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amended the compliance dates on April 15, 2005, will be effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. The new standard will require us to record compensation expense for stock options using a fair value method. On March 29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), which provides the Staff’s views regarding interactions between FAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. We are currently evaluating FAS 123R and SAB 107 to determine the fair value method to measure compensation expense, the appropriate assumptions to include in the fair value model and the transition method to use upon adoption. The impact of the adoption of FAS 123R is not known at this time due to these factors as well as the unknown level of share-based payments granted in future years. The effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options using the Black-Scholes model is presented in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies). Under certain conditions, stock options granted by the Company are eligible for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the employee. The FASB clarified in FAS 123R that the fair value of such stock options should be expensed based on an accelerated vesting schedule or immediately, rather than ratably over the vesting period stated in the grant. Our pro forma disclosure currently reflects the expense of such options ratably over the stated vesting period, expensing all unvested shares upon actual retirement. The SEC has recently clarified that companies should continue to follow the vesting method they have been using until adoption of FAS 123R, then apply the accelerated vesting schedule to all subsequent grants to those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement. Had we been accounting for such stock options 25 Table of Contents using the accelerated vesting schedule for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement, we would have recognized additional stock-based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure of the effect of expensing stock options presented in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies) of $0.05 per diluted share in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Reserve for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future 26 Table of Contents changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded as other expense, net. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted 27 Table of Contents cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We adopted FAS 142 effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors, including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units. Our estimates may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. As discussed further above, upon adoption of FAS 142 in fiscal 2003, we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $266.1 million. This charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change. Subsequent to adoption, any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change. Other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense, net. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any impairment charges would be classified as other expense, net. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted (FAS 133) have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes significantly, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss 28 Table of Contents carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Therefore, actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge 29 Table of Contents certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party or intercompany transactions. When we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months, although at May 31, 2005 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 24 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our European and Japanese subsidiaries. We use forward contracts to hedge non-functional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Korean won, Australian dollars, and Mexican pesos. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of medium and long-term fixed rate debt, commercial paper, and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/ co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $25.7 and $24.9 million at May 31, 2005 and May 31, 2004, respectively. The increase in VaR as of May 31, 2005 occurred due to a larger portfolio of foreign currency derivative instruments which was largely offset by the effect of lower currency volatility on existing trades on the May 31, 2005 VaR computation versus the May 31, 2004 VaR computation. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $37.2 million and $50.0 million for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Details of other market-sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below, except the interest rate swaps which are described below. These instruments include intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

Intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties, as discussed above. The fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries. There were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal 2005. We did not issue any long-term fixed-rate corporate bonds during fiscal 2005; however, during fiscal 2002, 2003 and fiscal 2004 we issued a total of $490 million in long-term fixed-rate corporate bonds that mature between August 2006 and October 2015. Fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 4.7% to 5.66%. For each of the bonds issued in fiscal 2002, 2003 and fiscal 2004, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three-month or six-month LIBOR plus a spread. As a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 4.17% at May 31, 2005 and 2.4% at May 31, 2004. Each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond, except for one swap for a $50 million bond issued in fiscal 2004. The $50 million bond issued in fiscal 2004 matures in October 2013 whereas the associated interest rate swap expires in October 2006. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt, except for the $50 million swap expiring in October 2006 which is not accounted for as a hedge. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period. The recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net $9.0 million gain at May 31, 2005 and a $3.3 million gain at May 31, 2004. The recorded fair value of the $50 million interest rate swap expiring October 2006 was not material for the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2004. In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.8% and receives variable interest payments based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion Japanese yen. This interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge, accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period. The recorded fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended May 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations following are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies 15 Table of Contents require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer. In these cases, we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Reserve for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. 16 Table of Contents Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation (advertising and promotion) expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Certain contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded as other expense. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” (FAS 142) effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized 17 Table of Contents in goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors, including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units. Our estimates may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. As discussed further below, upon adoption of FAS 142, we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $266.1 million. This charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change. In future periods, any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change. Other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any impairment charges would be classified as other expense. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes significantly, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income/expense during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. 18 Table of Contents We take a conservative approach in determining the amount of foreign earnings to declare as reinvested offshore. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the presumption is that such earnings will be repatriated in the future. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of such foreign earnings, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this conservative approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our conservative approach may result in accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) being determined in the future to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Therefore, actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. Results of Operations Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 • Revenues increased 8% to $10.7 billion, the highest annual revenues in the history of NIKE. • Income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased to $740.1 million from $668.3 million in the prior year, an increase of 11%. After the effect of the accounting change, net income declined 29% from $663.3 million to $474.0 million. • Diluted earnings per share before the effect of the accounting change increased by 13%, from $2.46 to $2.77. After the effect of the accounting change, diluted earnings per share declined 27%. • Gross margins increased as a percentage of revenues from 39.3% to 41.0% in fiscal 2003. • Selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues to 29.3% from 28.5% in the prior year. Revenue growth in our international regions drove the 8% increase in consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the euro, were responsible for 4% of the consolidated revenue growth. 19 Table of Contents Our largest international region, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), reported 20% revenue growth in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. This growth reflected a 15 percentage point improvement due to changes in currency exchange rates. Growth in the emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe was the key driver of the balance of the increase, as our distribution continued to expand in these markets and customer demand increased. Excluding the effect from changes in currency exchange rates, each of our EMEA business units, footwear, apparel, and equipment, delivered revenue growth versus the prior year. EMEA pre-tax income grew from $422.4 million in fiscal 2002 to $533.0 million in fiscal 2003. Higher revenues and improved gross margins drove the increase, more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs. In Asia Pacific, revenues increased 19% in fiscal 2003; five percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Asia Pacific business unit grew in fiscal 2003, as did sales in almost every country of the region, particularly Japan and Korea, driven primarily by heightened consumer demand for our products following the 2002 World Cup and our related marketing campaign, and China, driven primarily by an expansion of retail distribution of our products. Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific region increased from $216.2 million in fiscal 2002 to $295.0 million in fiscal 2003. This increase reflected higher revenues and improved gross margins that more than offset higher selling and administrative costs. In the Americas region, fiscal 2003 revenues decreased 7% compared to fiscal 2002, reflecting higher sales in local currencies that were more than offset by a 15 percentage point decline due to changes in currency exchange rates. This currency exchange impact was due to weaker currencies in the Latin American markets, partially offset by the stronger Canadian dollar. Excluding the currency exchange rate impact, the region experienced sales growth in the footwear and equipment business units slightly offset by a small percentage decrease in the apparel business unit. On a geographic basis, excluding currency exchange rate impacts, the region experienced sales growth in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, reflecting stronger consumer demand. The sales growth in Argentina reflected a rebound since fiscal 2002 when that country underwent an economic crisis. Pre-tax income for the Americas region grew from $92.1 million in fiscal 2002 to $96.3 million in fiscal 2003. Pre-tax income improved despite lower reported revenues primarily due to an improved gross margin percentage. In the U.S. region, revenues were down slightly in fiscal 2003, at $4,658.4 million versus $4,669.6 million in fiscal 2002. U.S. footwear revenues were down 4%, more than offsetting sales growth in U.S. apparel and equipment. U.S. apparel sales increased $95.3 million dollars, primarily driven by increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel. Lower revenues in the footwear business unit were largely the result of a significant change in our U.S. footwear distribution. During fiscal 2003, we began a realignment of our U.S. footwear distribution to address the changing retail marketplace, including our largest customer’s (Foot Locker) reduction in emphasis on premium footwear in its offerings. The objectives of this realignment are to improve the presentation and profitability of the NIKE brand in the U.S. As a result of changes in both Foot Locker’s orders and our product offerings to this account, our fiscal 2003 sales to Foot Locker in the U.S. were significantly below the level of fiscal 2002. At the same time, we expanded the premium products available to other athletic specialty and independent retailers that focus on premium footwear offerings, increasing sales to these accounts significantly. Based upon U.S. futures orders scheduled for delivery through December 2003, we expect that U.S. footwear revenues will remain below prior year levels at least through the first half of fiscal 2004. In the short 20 Table of Contents term, we do not expect to fully offset the revenue decline from Foot Locker in the U.S., and the amounts of future sales to Foot Locker are uncertain. However, we believe the NIKE brand continues to enjoy strong consumer demand and that we will successfully realign our distribution to fulfill consumers’ demand for our products and generate profitable revenue growth. Our unit sales of footwear in the U.S. increased slightly as compared to fiscal 2002. However, this volume increase was more than offset by a decline in the average price per pair of footwear sold. The reduction in average price per pair in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002 reflected a higher percentage of sales of classic footwear and kids’ models, which have a lower average price than our more complex adult performance models. Based upon futures orders, average price per pair ordered by customers for delivery in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was slightly below the prior year, but the average price per pair increased for second quarter orders. U.S. region pre-tax income increased from $956.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $957.5 million in fiscal 2003. Pre-tax income improved, despite lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense, due to improved gross margins. Other revenues include revenues from Bauer NIKE Hockey, Inc., Cole Haan Holdings, Inc., Hurley International LLC, and NIKE Golf. In fiscal 2003, we began managing the NIKE Golf operations in our largest golf markets separately from our regional businesses. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, revenues and pre-tax income for these businesses have been excluded from the regional results and reported in the Other category. This NIKE Golf information for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 has been reclassified in this Form 10-K to conform to the fiscal 2003 presentation. Other revenues grew 12% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The addition of revenues from our Hurley business, purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, drove the increase in Other revenues. Other pre-tax income declined from $56.8 million in fiscal 2002 to $18.9 million in fiscal 2003. Reduced profitability at NIKE Golf drove this decline, reflecting significantly weaker demand in the U.S. golf market versus fiscal 2002 and start-up issues we experienced at a third-party distribution facility. We expect that demand in the U.S. for golf products throughout the industry and for our business may remain weak in the near term due to the current slowdown of the U.S. economy. 21 Table of Contents The breakdown of revenues follows: Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 FY03 vs. FY02 % CHG Fiscal 2001 FY02 vs. FY01 % CHG (Dollars in millions) USA Region Footwear $ 3,019.5 $ 3,135.5 (4 )% $ 3,167.4 (1 )% Apparel 1,351.0 1,255.7 8 % 1,207.9 4 % Equipment 287.9 278.4 3 % 273.6 2 % Total USA 4,658.4 4,669.6 — 4,648.9 — EMEA Region Footwear 1,896.0 1,543.8 23 % 1,415.7 9 % Apparel 1,133.1 977.9 16 % 961.0 2 % Equipment 212.6 174.8 22 % 176.3 (1 )% Total EMEA 3,241.7 2,696.5 20 % 2,553.0 6 % Asia Pacific Region Footwear 732.4 640.2 14 % 617.5 4 % Apparel 499.3 403.3 24 % 356.1 13 % Equipment 127.1 98.7 29 % 91.5 8 % Total Asia Pacific 1,358.8 1,142.2 19 % 1,065.1 7 % Americas Region Footwear 337.3 359.1 (6 )% 355.2 1 % Apparel 148.1 167.1 (11 )% 152.1 10 % Equipment 41.6 41.9 (1 )% 31.8 32 % Total Americas 527.0 568.1 (7 )% 539.1 5 % 9,785.9 9,076.4 8 % 8,806.1 3 % Other 911.1 816.6 12 % 682.7 20 % Total Revenues $ 10,697.0 $ 9,893.0 8 % $ 9,488.8 4 % This discussion includes disclosure of “pre-tax income” for our operating segments. We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” As discussed in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the attached Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre-tax income of our operating segments. Worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June 2003 to November 2003 were 5.0% higher than such orders reported in the comparable period of fiscal 2002. Five points of this reported increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year. On our June 26, 2003 press release, we reported that worldwide futures and advance orders for this period were up 4.4% as compared to last year and that futures and advance orders in the U.S. were down 10% as compared to last year. Our futures program permits changes to orders for a short period of time following the order deadline. Such changes to U.S. orders, most notably additional orders of footwear from Foot Locker, increased the growth in worldwide futures for the June to November period by 0.6 percentage points, to 5.0%, and reduced the decrease in U.S. orders from 10% to 9%. These orders were for footwear consistent with our distribution realignment strategy discussed above. The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenues is not derived from futures orders, including wholesale sales of equipment, 22 Table of Contents U.S. licensed team apparel, Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan, NIKE Golf, Hurley, and retail sales across all brands. In fiscal 2003, our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 1.7 points as compared to fiscal 2002, from 39.3% to 41.0%. Significant factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage were as follows: (1) Product cost reductions resulting from our global initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce materials costs. (2) A higher mix of sales of classic footwear models which are generally more profitable than our more complex performance models. Lower pricing of NIKE Golf products as a result of market conditions discussed above partially offset these positive margin drivers. Changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2003 as the benefit of stronger hedge rates in some currencies was offset by weaker hedge rates in other currencies. A significant portion of product purchases for fiscal 2004 are already hedged and we expect that changes in year-over-year hedge rates will have a net positive effect on our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2004, as the benefits of stronger euro hedge rates more than offset weaker hedge rates in other currencies. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from 28.5% in fiscal 2002 to 29.3% in fiscal 2003. Both demand creation and operating overhead expense increased as a percentage of revenues. Demand creation expense grew from $1,027.9 million in fiscal 2002 to $1,168.6 million in fiscal 2003. Higher costs incurred in the EMEA region drove the growth in demand creation expense, reflecting, 1) a stronger euro currency exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in higher U.S. dollar expenses for costs that are euro-denominated, 2) our new endorsement agreement with the Manchester United soccer team that became effective in August 2002, and 3) costs of our World Cup marketing campaign incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Higher demand creation expenses were also incurred in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions due to the World Cup marketing campaign. We also increased demand creation spending in the U.S. in order to drive continued consumer demand for footwear while we realign our distribution to retail customers. Operating overhead increased from $1,792.5 million in fiscal 2002 to $1,969.0 million in fiscal 2003. Major drivers of this increase were the stronger euro exchange rate, incremental costs related to our on-going development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain, (primarily reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information), investments in headcount for our NIKE Golf business, the addition of Hurley overhead costs beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, and overhead costs of additional retail stores in EMEA and Asia Pacific. As part of our worldwide supply chain initiative, we implemented new systems in the EMEA region in fiscal 2003. Prior to the EMEA region implementation, we implemented new systems and processes for certain global functions and for our U.S. and Canadian businesses. Over the next few years, we will continue to enhance and refine the systems and processes in the U.S., EMEA and Canada as well as implement our new supply chain platform in the remaining countries in which we operate. Over this time period, operating overhead expense will continue to include costs of the supply chain initiative as well as costs for supporting our existing system infrastructure for those businesses where we have not yet implemented the new systems. This initiative is intended to improve revenue (by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions), margins (by lowering close-outs and distribution costs) and cash flow (by reducing inventories). In the U.S., where the new systems have been in place for over a year, we have begun to see improvements in several key performance measures. The ultimate level of benefit, if any, to revenues, margins, and cash flows will not be known until the new systems and processes have been implemented in the remaining countries in which we operate and globally integrated over the next few years. Interest expense decreased from $47.6 million in fiscal 2002 to $42.9 million in fiscal 2003, a decline of 10%. The decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels, as we have used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt. 23 Table of Contents Other income/expense was net expense of $79.9 million compared to net expense of $3.0 million in fiscal 2002. Significant amounts included in other income/expense were interest income, profit sharing expense, goodwill amortization (fiscal 2002 only), and certain foreign currency gains and losses. An increase in net foreign currency losses was the largest contributor to the increase in other expense versus last year. These foreign currency losses were primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany charges to a European subsidiary, whose functional currency is the euro. These losses are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information. The hedge losses reflected that the euro has strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts. In fiscal 2003, net foreign currency losses in other income/expense were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits. Our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a $13 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes. Consistent with our existing policies, we have continued to hedge anticipated intercompany charges for fiscal 2004. Since the euro has continued to strengthen since these hedge contracts were executed, we expect to continue to incur some hedge losses in fiscal 2004. However, we expect the net impact of the hedge losses and the offsetting positive translation impact will result in a net benefit to fiscal 2004 consolidated net income versus the prior year. Our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate was 34.1%, relatively consistent with the fiscal 2002 effective rate of 34.3%. Included in fiscal 2003 net income was a $266.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing FAS 142. This charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with Bauer NIKE Hockey and the goodwill of Cole Haan, reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values. In addition, the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a reduction to goodwill and intangible asset amortization of $13.1 million as compared to fiscal 2002. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 4 — Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill) for further information. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 • Revenues increased 4% to $9.9 billion, compared to $9.5 billion in fiscal 2001. • Income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased to $668.3 million from $589.7 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. After the effect of the accounting change, net income rose 12%. • Diluted earnings per share before the effect of the accounting change increased by 14%, from $2.16 to $2.46. After the effect of the accounting change, diluted earnings per share rose 13%. • Gross margins increased as a percentage of revenues to 39.3% from 39.0% in fiscal 2001. • Selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues to 28.5% from 28.3% in fiscal 2001. • Included in fiscal 2002 net income was a $5.0 million after-tax loss related to the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” As discussed above, our fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 Nike Golf information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2003 presentation. This presentation reflects significant NIKE Golf operations as a separate business in the Other category rather than within each of our geographical regions. The following discussion of fiscal 2002 results versus fiscal 2001 by region reflects this reclassification of NIKE Golf operations. This reclassification did not result in any change to our previously reported consolidated results, nor did it result in a significant change to the previously reported revenue and profitability trends in each of our regional businesses in fiscal 2002. This reclassification did result in significantly higher revenues and profits reported in the Other category. 24 Table of Contents In the U.S. region, revenues were flat in fiscal 2002 versus fiscal 2001, reflecting increased sales of apparel and equipment offset by decreased sales of footwear. The increased sales in apparel reflected higher demand for in-line products, particularly for NIKE brand and Brand Jordan basketball apparel, more than offsetting the effect of the expiration of our apparel license agreement with the National Football League in fiscal 2001. While in-line sales of footwear increased in fiscal 2002, particularly in the mid-range price segment, close-out sales decreased significantly. The reduction in close-out sales reflected both our efforts to limit the availability of close-out products in the marketplace (in order to build overall profitability) and relatively high levels of close-out sales in the last half of fiscal 2001 due to supply chain system disruptions. As in the apparel business, sales of NIKE brand and Brand Jordan basketball footwear products were the primary drivers of increased wholesale sales of in-line footwear during the year. Despite revenues and selling and administrative expense being essentially consistent with fiscal 2001, U.S. pre-tax income increased from $905.0 million to $956.0 million, driven primarily by an improved gross margin percentage. In fiscal 2002, revenues from our international regions grew 6% versus the prior year. Changes in currency exchange rates decreased the international region growth rate 6 percentage points and decreased our consolidated growth rate 3 percentage points. Fiscal 2002 reported revenues in EMEA increased by 6% over fiscal 2001, including a 4 percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the negative effect of currency exchange rates, EMEA revenues grew in each of our business units, footwear, apparel, and equipment and in almost every country in the region, reflecting increasing demand for NIKE brand products throughout EMEA. EMEA pre-tax income grew 16% from $363.4 million to $422.4 million. Growth in revenues and a higher gross margin percentage drove the increase in pre-tax income. In our Asia Pacific region, reported revenues grew 7%, including a 10 percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates. Asia Pacific revenues grew in each business unit and in almost every country in the region, with the largest growth coming from Japan, Korea, and China. Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific region increased from $184.4 million to $216.2 million. The increase in revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues drove the growth in pre-tax income, which was partially offset by a decline in gross margin percentage. The Americas region reported revenues grew 5%, including a 7 percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates, despite a drop-off in sales in Argentina during the second half of fiscal 2002 as a result of the country’s economic crisis. Revenues in the Americas region grew in each of our business units, led by growth in Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. Pre-tax income for the Americas region increased from $81.6 million to $92.1 million. The increase in revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues drove the growth in pre-tax income, which was partially offset by a decline in gross margin percentage. In fiscal 2002, Other revenues, including revenues from Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan, Hurley, and NIKE Golf, increased 20% to $816.6 million, driven by growth in NIKE Golf. The Hurley acquisition did not have a significant impact on fiscal 2002 revenues since the acquisition did not occur until the last quarter of fiscal 2002. Other pre-tax income declined from $74.2 million to $56.8 million, driven by a decline in profitability at Cole Haan. Despite slight revenue growth at Cole Haan during the year, pre-tax income declined due to relatively high discounting and inventory obsolescence as a result of depressed consumer demand in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 25 Table of Contents Our gross margin percentage improved from 39.0% in fiscal 2001 to 39.3% in fiscal 2002. Factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 were as follows: (1) Higher in-line pricing margins in EMEA, due to the effect of higher prices effective at the beginning of the fiscal year and sourcing and warehousing efficiencies, partially offset by the effect of weaker euro/U.S. dollar currency hedge rates relative to fiscal 2001. (2) Higher footwear margins in the U.S. due in part to lower product costs and lower transportation costs, as a result of both effective negotiations with shippers and lower air freight costs incurred. Relatively higher air freight costs were incurred in fiscal 2001 due to supply chain system problems. (3) A higher mix of in-line sales versus close-out sales of U.S. footwear, reflecting increased demand for in-line footwear and lower close-out sales as compared to fiscal 2001 as discussed above. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from 28.3% in fiscal 2001 to 28.5% in fiscal 2002. Operating overhead increased 6% in fiscal 2002. Significant drivers of the increased operating overhead included increased investment in our supply chain initiative, additional headcount to support our golf and European businesses due to business growth, additional expense for compensation programs tied to our profitability and stock performance, and costs for additional retail stores primarily in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. Demand creation expense was $1,027.9 million in fiscal 2002 versus $998.2 million in fiscal 2001, which was consistent between years as a percentage of revenues. Our fiscal 2002 demand creation expense reflected incremental spending for our World Cup 2002 marketing campaign, which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Interest expense decreased 19%, from $58.7 million in fiscal 2001 to $47.6 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels, as we used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt. Other income/expense was a net expense of $3.0 million in fiscal 2002 versus a net expense of $34.1 million in fiscal 2001. Significant amounts included in other income/expense included interest income, profit sharing expense, goodwill amortization, certain foreign currency gains and losses, and asset disposal gains/losses. Net other expense decreased between years as the fiscal 2001 amount included charges for contractual settlements that did not recur in fiscal 2002. In addition, fiscal 2002 other income/expense included credits related to the favorable resolution of some outstanding claims. Our fiscal 2002 effective tax rate was 34.3% as compared to 36.0% in fiscal 2001. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we do not accrue a U.S. tax liability on foreign earnings permanently invested offshore. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 is primarily the result of a larger amount of foreign earnings permanently invested offshore in fiscal 2002 than in fiscal 2001. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (FAS 143). This statement requires that a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized at fair value in the period the obligation is incurred and the associated retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tangible long-lived asset. All provisions of this statement will be effective for the Company on June 1, 2003. We do not expect that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (FAS 146). This statement supercedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3 “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring),” FAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3, a liability was recognized at the date an entity committed to an exit plan. FAS 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. The provisions of FAS 146 are effective for any exit and disposal activities initiated after 26 Table of Contents December 31, 2002. We have not entered into any significant exit or disposal activities since the effective date of this rule. As such, FAS 146 has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations, and no significant impact is expected in the foreseeable future. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued. The recognition provisions of FIN 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 were effective beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2003. In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise, and other items that fall under the scope of FIN 45. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material. Hence, the adoption of FIN 45 has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations, and no significant impact is expected in the foreseeable future. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation— Transition and Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” (FAS 148). This statement amends SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” (FAS 123) to provide alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. FAS 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require disclosure of the method used to account for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements. The disclosure provisions are effective for us beginning with this fiscal 2003 annual report on Form 10-K. The annual impact of a change to the fair value model prescribed by FAS 123 has been disclosed in our previous 10-K filings, and the applicable disclosures in this report are in Note 1 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At this time, we plan to continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” rather than change to the FAS 123 fair value method. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46). This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” addresses consolidation of variable interest entities. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved. The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for those variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The provisions are effective for the first period beginning after June 15, 2003 for those variable interests held prior to February 1, 2003. We do not currently have any variable interest entities as defined in FIN 46. Accordingly, we do not expect the provisions of FIN 46 to affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2003 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $917.4 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $1,081.5 million in fiscal 2002. Our primary source of operating cash flow was income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $740.1 million. Operating cash flow decreased compared to the prior year due to increased investment in certain working capital components during fiscal 2003, including inventories. While a decline in inventory levels provided a source of cash during fiscal 2002, an increase in inventory levels during fiscal 2003 resulted in a use of cash, primarily due to our decision to purchase product for the U.S. “back-to-school” selling season earlier than we did last year in order to improve the timeliness of shipments to customers. Cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2003 was $215.6 million, compared to $302.8 million invested during fiscal 2002. The most significant investing activities in both periods were expenditures for 27 Table of Contents computer equipment and software related to our supply chain initiative and continued investment in NIKE-owned retail stores. Spending for both of these activities declined in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Additionally, fiscal 2002 spending included our acquisition of all of the assets and substantially all of the liabilities of Hurley International LLC, an action sports and youth lifestyle brand company. Costs incurred for distribution center projects increased in fiscal 2003, the largest project being construction of a new storage building in Japan, with scheduled opening in the second half of fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, we will continue to make investments in systems improvements (most notably the supply chain initiative), retail expansion, and our worldwide distribution center facilities. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we entered into an agreement to purchase Converse Inc., discussed further below. Cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2003 was $605.2 million, up from $478.2 million in the prior year. This amount included uses of cash for dividends to shareholders, a net reduction in debt, and share repurchases. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. The share repurchases were part of a $1.0 billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal 2001, after completion of a four-year, $1.0 billion program in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2003, we repurchased 4.0 million shares of NIKE’s Class B common stock for $191.0 million. To date, under the current program, we have purchased a total of 12.3 million shares of NIKE’s Class B common stock for $585.7 million. We expect to continue to fund the current program from operating cash flow. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Long-term Financial Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2003 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ended May 31, Description of Commitment 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 188.9 149.6 129.5 111.1 92.2 505.6 $ 1,176.9 Long-term Debt 205.7 5.9 5.9 255.9 30.9 227.5 731.8 Endorsement Contracts 338.6 292.1 247.2 230.7 129.1 204.7 1,442.4 Other 25.5 9.5 2.5 1.4 1.2 0.2 40.3 The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts will likely be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as a limited number of contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athlete performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments disclosed above, we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. An outsourcing contractor provides us with information technology operations management services through 2006. The amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services. If we were to terminate the entire contract as of May 31, 2003, we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of $32.7 million. Our monthly payments to the contractor currently are approximately $6 million. 28 Table of Contents We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2003. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 — Short-term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as of May 31, 2003 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates, generally ninety days from issuance or on demand $ 75.4 Payable to Nissho Iwai American Company (NIAC) for the purchase of inventories, generally due sixty days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 49.6 As of May 31, 2003, letters of credit of $704.4 million were outstanding, primarily for the purchase of inventory. All letters of credit generally expire within one year. On July 9, 2003, we entered into an agreement to purchase all of the equity shares of Converse Inc., a widely recognized footwear company based in Massachusetts, for $305 million cash. Prior to closing, this transaction is subject to regulatory review, including U.S. government review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger Notification Act. If the acquisition is completed, we do not expect it will have a significant effect on our liquidity, results of operations or financial position in the short term. While we do expect a positive impact on our long-term profitability from this acquisition, we cannot reasonably estimate this impact at this time. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which $1.0 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium-term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500.0 million in medium-term notes, as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements. During fiscal 2003, we issued a total of $90 million in notes under the medium-term note program. The notes have coupon rates that range from 4.80% to 5.66%. The maturities range from July 9, 2007 to August 7, 2012. For each of the notes, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the three-month or six-month London Inter Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. Each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as its respective note. After issuance of these notes, $410.0 million remains available to be issued under our medium note program, and another $500.0 million remains available to be issued under our shelf registration statement. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2004 depending on working capital general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2003, we had a total of $1.0 billion available under two committed credit facilities in place with a group of banks, and we currently have no amounts outstanding under either facility. The first facility is a $500.0 million, 364-day facility that will mature on November 14, 2003 and can be extended 364 days on each maturity date. The second facility is a $500.0 million, multi-year facility that matures on November 17, 2005, and once a year it can be extended for one additional year. Both of these facilities have been in place since fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2003, upon renewal in November 2002, the 364-day facility was reduced from $600.0 million to $500.0 million. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A and A2 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the 364-day facility would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.24%, and the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the multi-year facility would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.22%. The facility fees for the 364-day facility and the multi-year facility are 0.06% and 0.08%, respectively, of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates under our committed credit facilities would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fees and interest 29 Table of Contents rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. However, under these committed credit facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, and set a minimum ratio of net worth to indebtedness. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2003, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2003 and $338.3 million outstanding at May 31, 2002. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Dividends per share of common stock for fiscal 2003 were $0.54, compared to $0.48 in fiscal 2002. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. We review our dividend policy from time to time; however, based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements, we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, production and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party or intercompany transactions. When we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months, although at May 31, 2003 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our European and Japanese subsidiaries. We use forward contracts and cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in European currencies, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Korean won, Mexican pesos and Australian dollars. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of medium and long-term fixed rate debt, commercial paper, and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay variable interest. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. 30 Table of Contents We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and hence does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based transactions that are anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the VaR calculation, including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $21.0 million and $13.7 million at May 31, 2003 and May 31, 2002, respectively. The increase in VaR as of May 31, 2003 occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the May 31, 2003 VaR computation versus the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the May 31, 2002 VaR computation. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $43.3 million and $42.9 million for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. Details of other market-sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below, except the interest rate swaps which are described below. These instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, cross-currency swaps, and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. We have excluded the cross-currency swaps from the foreign exchange risk category because these instruments eliminate all foreign currency exposure in the cash flows of a euro denominated intercompany loan. We have included these cross-currency swaps in the interest rate risk category but excluded the related intercompany loan from this category because the intercompany interest eliminates in consolidation. For the cross-currency swaps the table presents both the euro swap payable and U.S. dollar swap receivable and the respective pay and receive interest rates. All information is presented in millions of U.S. dollars, except interest rates. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation. Intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties. The fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries. There were no significant changes in debt or cross-currency swap market risks during fiscal 2003. The U.S. dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies was $649.4 million at May 31, 2002, which is the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination. The U.S. dollar fair value of the fixed rate Japanese yen denominated debt that was outstanding at May 31, 2002 was $207.4 million versus a carrying value of $181.4 million at that date. The U.S. dollar fair values of the fixed rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, the euro swap payable and the U.S. dollar swap receivable as of May 31, 2002 were $516.5 million, $196.2 million and $267.9 million, respectively, versus carrying values of $499.8 million, $188.8 million and $250.0 million, respectively, at that date. 31 Table of Contents In fiscal 2002 we issued a $250 million long-term fixed-rate corporate bond which matures in August 2006. In fiscal 2003, we issued an additional $90 million in long-term fixed-rate corporate bonds which mature on various dates beginning in July 2007 through August 2012. Fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 4.8% to 5.66%. For each of these bonds issued in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three-month or six-month LIBOR plus a spread. Each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond. As a result of the interest rate swap agreements, the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 2.5% at May 31, 2003 and 3.3% at May 31, 2002. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt. The recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $25.5 million gain at May 31, 2003 and a $1.8 million loss at May 31, 2002. In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.8% and receives variable interest payments based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion Japanese yen.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts in the United States and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and subsidiaries in over 120 countries. Our goal is to deliver value to five constituencies: shareholders, consumers, business partners, employees and the community. We aim to deliver that value by focusing on our mission … To bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete* in the world *If you have a body, you are an athlete. and building our capabilities in four key areas: • Deepening our relationship with consumers; • Delivering superior, innovative product to the marketplace; • Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline and excellence; and • Accelerating growth through focused execution. We believe we can create value for our shareholders in striving for the following key long-term financial goals: • High single digit revenue growth; • Mid-teens earnings per share growth; • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows; and • Delivery of consistent results through management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. 14 Table of Contents In fiscal 2004 we met or surpassed these goals primarily through a combination of revenue growth and gross margin improvements across our businesses, management of working capital and share repurchases. In addition, the impact of foreign currency changes has had a significant favorable impact on this year’s financial results. Although in any particular quarter or even annual period we may not meet some or all of the financial goals outlined above, we believe these are appropriate goals for the longer term.

Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 3 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth and all three of our international regions posted higher revenues, with our Asia Pacific Region making the largest contribution. Converse, which was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004, contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 15 — Acquisition) for additional information related to the acquisition. Improved sales in the U.S Region and increases in our Other businesses drove the balance of the consolidated revenue growth. During fiscal 2004, our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 190 basis points versus the prior year, from 41.0% to 42.9%. The primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004 were as follows: (1) Changes in hedge rates, primarily the euro, represented 70 basis points of improvement for fiscal 2004. The positive impact of hedge rates on the fiscal 2004 gross margin percentage was most significant in the fourth quarter, contributing 140 basis points of the year-over-year quarterly improvement. As a majority of product purchases for fiscal 2005 have been hedged, we expect a positive impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2005 due to improved year-over-year hedge rates, primarily for the euro. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives) for additional information on hedges. (2) Higher in-line pricing margins (net revenue for current product offerings minus landed product cost) drove approximately 70 basis points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004. This is primarily attributable to improved footwear margins as a result of lower product costs due to manufacturing efficiencies, reduced materials costs and lower air freight. 15 Table of Contents (3) Improved profitability on wholesale closeout sales (non-current product offerings), primarily in the U.S. and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions due to improved closeout pricing margins, partially offset by increased obsolescence reserves due to a less favorable mix of product remaining in closeout inventory. These factors represented approximately 10 basis points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004. (4) Most of the remaining increase was due to improved gross margin percentages for NIKE-owned retail stores in the U.S. and EMEA regions, which contributed approximately 30 basis points of the improvement in consolidated gross margins for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 selling and administrative expense, comprised of demand creation and operating overhead, grew 17% versus fiscal 2003. Demand creation (advertising and promotion) expense grew 18% to $1,377.9 million in fiscal 2004. Seven percentage points of the increase in demand creation was due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on endorsement contracts in the U.S., primarily basketball (3 percentage point impact), incremental investment in retail marketing in the U.S., EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions (3 percentage point impact), and higher advertising spending in the Asia Pacific region (1 percentage point impact). The addition of Converse contributed 2 percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year. Operating overhead for fiscal 2004 was $2,324.1 million, a 17% increase over fiscal 2003. Currency exchange rates contributed 5 percentage points of the increase. The addition of Converse accounted for 2 percentage points of growth. Other key factors driving the increase in operating overhead for the fiscal year were: (a) increased incentive-based compensation for employees (3 percentage points); and (b) increased costs to support the growth of our NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Bauer NIKE Hockey and Hurley businesses (2 percentage points). The remaining increase, about 5 percentage points, is primarily attributable to normal wage increases and some added infrastructure necessary to support global business growth, including costs related to our worldwide supply chain initiative and additional factory outlet stores in the EMEA Region. Over the last five years, as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain, we have implemented new systems in Canada, the U.S. and EMEA regions and are now implementing them in Japan, Southeast Asia and our Hong Kong Apparel operations. Over the next few years, we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in these operations and complete the implementation of new systems in the remainder of our global operations. This initiative is intended to improve revenue (by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions); improve margins (by lowering the volume of close-out inventories and distribution costs including inbound air freight); and improve cash flow (by reducing inventories and accounts receivable through better visibility). In the U.S. and EMEA regions, where the new systems have been in place for over a year, we have begun to see improvements in several key performance measures including gross margins (see above) and cash flows (see below). The ultimate level of benefit to revenues, margins, and cash flows will not be known until the new systems and processes have been implemented in the remaining countries in which we operate and globally integrated in subsequent years. At fiscal year end, approximately 80 percent of NIKE’s businesses had completed implementation of the new systems. During the period of implementation, operating overhead expense will continue to include both the cost of implementing and operating new systems and the cost of supporting the legacy systems. We anticipate completing the majority of the remaining implementations over the next two years. Other expense, net, was $74.7 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $77.5 million in fiscal 2003. Beginning this fiscal year, interest income and profit sharing expense previously included in other expense, net, are included in interest expense, net, and selling and administrative expense, respectively. The presentation of prior year amounts has been adjusted to conform to the current classification. The most significant components of other expense, net (comprising approximately 64 percent of this year’s net expense and 79 percent of fiscal 2003’s net expense), was foreign currency losses (primarily hedge losses on intercompany charges to a European subsidiary, whose functional currency is the euro), and hedge losses from that subsidiary’s investments in U.S. Dollar denominated debt securities available-for-sale. These losses are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment 16 Table of Contents presentation of pre-tax income in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information). The hedge losses reflect that the euro has strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts. Also included in other expense, net, for fiscal 2004 was an increase in net losses on asset disposals, including a loss of $5.3 million on land gifted to the NIKE Foundation in the first quarter. In 2004, net foreign currency losses in other expense, net, were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in EMEA. Our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a $157 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year. Consistent with our existing policies, in fiscal 2005 we have continued to hedge a portion of anticipated intercompany charges and investments in U.S. Dollar denominated debt securities available-for-sale. We expect the net impact of any hedge losses or gains and the offsetting translation impact will result in a significantly lower net benefit to fiscal 2005 than was realized in fiscal 2004. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 34.8%, which is higher than the fiscal 2003 rate of 34.1% as a result of a higher tax provision on foreign earnings in fiscal 2004. Included in net income for fiscal 2003 was a $266.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” (FAS 142). This charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with Bauer NIKE Hockey and the goodwill of Cole Haan, reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 4 — Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill) for further information. Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2004 were 11.3% higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2003. One point of this reported increase was due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year. Excluding this currency impact, higher average selling prices for footwear across all regions contributed 3 points of the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The remaining increase was due to volume increases for both apparel and footwear. On our June 24, 2004 press release, we reported that worldwide futures and advance orders for this period were up 10.7% as compared to last year. Our futures program permits changes to orders for a short period of time following the order deadline. Such changes to orders, most notably in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions, increased the growth in worldwide futures for the June through November period by 0.6 percentage points to 11.3%. As always, the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team apparel, Bauer NIKE Hockey, Cole Haan, Converse, NIKE Golf, Hurley, and retail sales across all brands. 17 Table of Contents Operating Segments The breakdown of revenues follows: Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 FY04 vs.FY03 % CHG Fiscal 2002 FY03 vs.FY02 % CHG (Dollars in millions) U.S. Region Footwear $ 3,070.4 $ 3,019.5 2 % $ 3,135.5 (4 )% Apparel 1,433.5 1,351.0 6 % 1,255.7 8 % Equipment 289.8 287.9 1 % 278.4 3 % Total U.S. 4,793.7 4,658.4 3 % 4,669.6 — EMEA Region Footwear 2,232.2 1,896.0 18 % 1,543.8 23 % Apparel 1,333.8 1,133.1 18 % 977.9 16 % Equipment 268.4 212.6 26 % 174.8 22 % Total EMEA 3,834.4 3,241.7 18 % 2,696.5 20 % Asia Pacific Region Footwear 855.3 730.6 17 % 638.2 14 % Apparel 612.3 497.8 23 % 400.6 24 % Equipment 145.8 120.8 21 % 96.1 26 % Total Asia Pacific 1,613.4 1,349.2 20 % 1,134.9 19 % Americas Region Footwear 412.0 337.3 22 % 359.1 (6 )% Apparel 165.8 148.1 12 % 167.1 (11 )% Equipment 47.0 41.6 13 % 41.9 (1 )% Total Americas 624.8 527.0 19 % 568.1 (7 )% 10,866.3 9,776.3 11 % 9,069.1 8 % Other 1,386.8 920.7 51 % 823.9 12 % Total Revenues $ 12,253.1 $ 10,697.0 15 % $ 9,893.0 8 % The discussion following includes disclosure of “pre-tax income” for our operating segments. We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” As discussed in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre-tax income of our operating segments. For EMEA, our largest international region, changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 16 percentage points of the reported increase in revenues in fiscal 2004. The remaining increase over the prior year was primarily driven by NIKE-owned retail (due to the addition of new stores in fiscal 2004) and increased footwear volume (led by soccer product). Excluding the impact of currency exchange movements, sales in each EMEA business unit (footwear, apparel, equipment) grew versus fiscal 2003. After several years in which the region’s revenues grew substantially faster than the overall market in Europe, fiscal 2004 revenue growth for EMEA was more in line with the growth of the overall market. Futures orders for the region scheduled for delivery from June through November 2004 were 9 percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal 2003; changes in currency exchange rates accounted for about 3 percentage points of this growth. An increase in the region’s footwear average price per pair contributed to this futures order growth. 18 Table of Contents EMEA pre-tax income for fiscal 2004 was $750.7 million, up 41% versus the prior year. Higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase, more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs. The improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved year-over-year hedge rates and higher in-line and closeout pricing margins. In the Asia Pacific Region, fiscal 2004 revenues increased 20% year-over-year. Eight percentage points of growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of currency exchange movements, sales in each Asia Pacific business unit grew versus fiscal 2003. The region’s revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases, with significant revenue growth in China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) and Japan (driven by strong consumer demand). Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region increased to $354.9 million in fiscal 2004, up 21% versus fiscal 2003. Higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase, more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs. The higher gross margins were primarily attributable to higher in-line pricing margins and the benefit of better hedge rates on product purchases, partially offset by lower profitability of closeouts. In the Americas Region, revenues increased 19% compared to fiscal 2003, with 8 percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the currency effects, the revenue growth was driven primarily by stronger consumer demand in South America and sales in each Americas business unit grew versus fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, pre-tax income for the Americas Region increased 6% from the prior year, to $101.9 million. The increase in pre-tax income was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates slightly offset by reduced gross margins and higher selling and administrative costs. Gross margins fell due to lower in-line pricing margins as well as weaker currency exchange rates in Mexico. In the U.S. Region, revenues for fiscal 2004 grew 3% versus fiscal 2003, as revenues increased in each business unit. The increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in sport performance product and increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel primarily in the first half of fiscal 2004. The increase in footwear revenue was due to an increase in average wholesale selling price per pair and increased sales in NIKE-owned retail stores, partially offset by a slight decline in wholesale unit sales. The increase in average wholesale selling price per pair was partially due to a larger percentage of sales of products with a suggested retail price over $100. The slight decline in U.S. footwear wholesale unit sales was largely due to changes in distribution to several retail customers. For the first half of the year, sales to our largest customer, Foot Locker, were lower as a result of changes to our distribution strategy implemented in fiscal 2002 and 2003; while the decline in first half sales resulted in slightly lower sales for the full year, our year-over-year sales to Foot Locker grew in the second half of fiscal 2004. In addition, fiscal 2004 sales declined for another large customer, Footstar, which declared bankruptcy in March 2004. The sales declines for Foot Locker and Footstar were partially offset by increased sales to other accounts. For the U.S. Region, futures orders scheduled for delivery from June through November 2004 increased 11 percentage points versus the prior year. Higher orders from Foot Locker were a factor in this increase. During our fiscal fourth quarter, Foot Locker acquired additional stores from Footstar. Further, as announced in November 2003 additional premium product offerings were made available to select Foot Locker locations beginning with the Fall 2004 season. Growth in futures orders from Foot Locker as compared to the prior year’s orders from Foot Locker and Footstar combined, contributed 3 percentage points of the overall region’s futures orders growth. Additionally, futures orders grew as a result of increases in average wholesale selling price per pair for footwear, due to increased orders for products with a suggested retail price over $100. 19 Table of Contents For fiscal 2004, pre-tax income for the U.S. Region was $1,015.1 million, a 5% increase versus fiscal 2003. Higher revenues and gross margins drove the increase, more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs. The improved gross margins were primarily the result of higher in-line and closeout pricing margins and expanded retail margins. The Other segment includes results from Bauer NIKE Hockey Inc., Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC and NIKE Golf. Revenues for Other grew 51% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003; the addition of Converse contributed 24 percentage points of the increase. The remainder of the increase was due to revenue growth at NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Hurley and Bauer NIKE Hockey. Pre-tax income for Other improved to $75.3 million in fiscal 2004, versus income of $5.2 million in fiscal 2003. The addition of Converse, combined with improved results from NIKE Golf and Cole Haan, drove the year-over-year improvement. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Consolidated Operating Results Revenue growth in our international regions drove the 8% increase in consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the euro, contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth. In fiscal 2003, our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 170 basis points as compared to fiscal 2002, from 39.3% to 41.0%. Significant factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage were as follows: (1) Product cost reductions resulting from our global initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce materials costs; and (2) A higher mix of sales of classic footwear models which are generally more profitable than our more complex performance models. Lower pricing of NIKE Golf products as a result of market conditions discussed below partially offset these positive margin drivers. Changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2003 as the benefit of stronger hedge rates in some currencies was offset by weaker hedge rates in other currencies. Selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from 28.7% in fiscal 2002 to 29.5% in fiscal 2003. Both demand creation and operating overhead expense increased as a percentage of revenues. Demand creation expense grew from $1,027.9 million in fiscal 2002 to $1,166.8 million in fiscal 2003. Higher costs incurred in the EMEA Region drove the growth in demand creation expense, reflecting, 1) a stronger euro currency exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in higher U.S. dollar expenses for costs that are euro-denominated, 2) our new endorsement agreement with the Manchester United soccer team that became effective in August 2002, and 3) costs of our World Cup marketing campaign incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Higher demand creation expenses were also incurred in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions due to the World Cup marketing campaign. We also increased demand creation spending in the U.S. in order to drive continued consumer demand for footwear while we realigned our distribution to retail customers. Operating overhead increased from $1,807.9 million in fiscal 2002 to $1,987.3 million in fiscal 2003. Major drivers of this increase were the stronger euro exchange rate, incremental costs related to our on-going development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain, (primarily reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information), investments in headcount for our NIKE Golf business, the addition of Hurley overhead costs beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, and overhead costs of additional retail stores in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. 20 Table of Contents Interest expense, net, decreased from $34.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $28.8 million in fiscal 2003, a decline of 15%. The decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels, as we have used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt. Other expense, net was $77.5 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $1.2 million in fiscal 2002. Significant amounts included in other expense, net were goodwill amortization (fiscal 2002 only), and certain foreign currency gains and losses. An increase in net foreign currency losses was the largest contributor to the increase in other expense, net for fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002. These foreign currency losses were primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany charges to a European subsidiary, whose functional currency is the euro. These losses are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information). The hedge losses reflected that the euro had strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts. In fiscal 2003, net foreign currency losses in other expense, net were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits. Our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation was a $13 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes. Our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate was 34.1%, relatively consistent with the fiscal 2002 effective rate of 34.3%. Included in fiscal 2003 net income was a $266.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing FAS 142. This charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with Bauer NIKE Hockey and the goodwill of Cole Haan, reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values. In addition, the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a reduction to goodwill and intangible asset amortization of $13.1 million as compared to fiscal 2002. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 4 — Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill) for further information. Operating Segments Our largest international region, EMEA, reported 20% revenue growth in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. This growth reflected a 15 percentage point improvement due to changes in currency exchange rates. Growth in the emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe was the key driver of the balance of the increase, as our distribution continued to expand in these markets and customer demand increased. Excluding the effect from changes in currency exchange rates, each of our EMEA business units delivered revenue growth versus the prior year. EMEA pre-tax income grew from $422.4 million in fiscal 2002 to $532.0 million in fiscal 2003. Higher revenues and improved gross margins drove the increase, more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs. In Asia Pacific, revenues increased 19% in fiscal 2003; five percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the benefit from changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Asia Pacific business unit grew in fiscal 2003, as did sales in almost every country of the region, particularly Japan and Korea, driven primarily by heightened consumer demand for our products following the 2002 World Cup and our related marketing campaign, and China, driven primarily by an expansion of retail distribution of our products. Pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region increased from $216.2 million in fiscal 2002 to $292.6 million in fiscal 2003. This increase reflected higher revenues and improved gross margins that more than offset higher selling and administrative costs. In the Americas Region, fiscal 2003 revenues decreased 7% compared to fiscal 2002, reflecting higher sales in local currencies that were more than offset by a 15 percentage point decline due to changes in currency exchange rates. This currency exchange impact was due to weaker currencies in the Latin American markets, partially offset by the stronger Canadian dollar. Excluding the currency exchange rate impact, the region 21 Table of Contents experienced sales growth in the footwear and equipment business units slightly offset by a small percentage decrease in the apparel business unit. On a geographic basis, excluding currency exchange rate impacts, the region experienced sales growth in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, reflecting stronger consumer demand. The sales growth in Argentina reflected a rebound since fiscal 2002 when that country underwent an economic crisis. Pre-tax income for the Americas Region grew from $92.1 million in fiscal 2002 to $96.5 million in fiscal 2003. Pre-tax income improved despite lower reported revenues primarily due to an improved gross margin percentage. In the U.S. Region, revenues were down slightly in fiscal 2003, at $4,658.4 million versus $4,669.6 million in fiscal 2002. U.S. footwear revenues were down 4%, more than offsetting sales growth in U.S. apparel and equipment. U.S. apparel sales increased $95.3 million, primarily driven by increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel. Lower revenues in the footwear business unit were largely the result of a significant change in our U.S. footwear distribution. During fiscal 2003, we began a realignment of our U.S. footwear distribution to address the changing retail marketplace, including our largest customer’s (Foot Locker) reduction in emphasis on premium footwear in its offerings. The objectives of this realignment were to improve the presentation and profitability of the NIKE brand in the U.S. As a result of changes in both Foot Locker’s orders and our product offerings to this account, our fiscal 2003 sales to Foot Locker in the U.S. were significantly below the level of fiscal 2002. At the same time, we expanded the premium products available to other athletic specialty and independent retailers that focus on premium footwear offerings, increasing sales to these accounts significantly. Our unit sales of footwear in the U.S. increased slightly as compared to fiscal 2002. However, this volume increase was more than offset by a decline in the average price per pair of footwear sold. The reduction in average price per pair in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002 reflected a higher percentage of sales of classic footwear and kids’ models, which have a lower average price than our more complex adult performance models. U.S. Region pre-tax income increased from $956.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $963.2 million in fiscal 2003. Pre-tax income improved, despite lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense, due to improved gross margins. Revenues for Other grew 12% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The addition of revenues from our Hurley business, purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, drove the increase in Other revenues. Pre-tax income for Other declined from $43.7 million in fiscal 2002 to $5.2 million in fiscal 2003. Reduced profitability at NIKE Golf drove this decline, reflecting significantly weaker demand in the U.S. golf market versus fiscal 2002 and start-up issues we experienced at a third-party distribution facility. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2004 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.5 billion in fiscal 2004, compared to $922.0 million in fiscal 2003. Our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of $945.6 million. In addition to the improvement in net income, the increase in cash compared to the prior year was attributable to changes in our investment in working capital primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable (excluding the acquisition of Converse and the effects of foreign currency, which were reported separately). In fiscal 2004 accounts receivable provided cash to the Company due to improved account management through better utilization of supply chain systems, especially in EMEA. Accounts payable provided cash to the Company due to the timing of inventory receipts and vendor payments. The changes in other working capital components were consistent with normal business operations. Cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2004 was $946.5 million, compared to $215.6 million invested during fiscal 2003. The most significant uses of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2004 were the 22 Table of Contents purchase of short-term investments and the acquisition of Converse, which accounted for $400.8 million and $289.1 million, respectively. The remaining investing activities are consistent with the prior year and primarily reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software to support both normal business operations as well as our supply chain systems upgrade, continued investment in NIKE-owned retail stores, and construction of a storage facility in Japan, which was completed in fiscal 2004. Cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2004 was $398.5 million, down from $606.5 million in the prior year. In fiscal 2004, the principal uses of cash for financing activities were share repurchases, payments of long-term debt, and dividends, offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and debt issuance. Net cash used by financing activities was higher in fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased repayments of short-term debt in that period. The share repurchases were part of a $1.0 billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2004, we repurchased 6.4 million shares of NIKE’s Class B common stock for $414.3 million, completing the program. Over the course of the four-year program, we purchased a total of 18.7 million shares of NIKE’s Class B common stock. In June 2004, the Board of Directors approved a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be completed over the next four years. We expect to continue to fund the new program from operating cash flow. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2004 were $0.74, compared to $0.54 in fiscal 2003. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. We review our dividend policy from time to time, and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2004 are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ended May 31, Description of Commitment 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 171.7 $ 143.4 $ 120.9 $ 103.4 $ 85.3 $ 523.5 $ 1,148.2 Long-term Debt 6.6 6.1 255.8 31.1 6.1 380.0 685.7 Endorsement Contracts1 355.5 322.7 323.1 208.6 128.4 375.2 1,713.5 Product Purchase Obligations2 1,648.9 — — — — — 1,648.9 Other3 260.5 19.8 8.2 5.9 3.9 1.3 299.6 Total $ 2,443.2 $ 492.0 $ 708.0 $ 349.0 $ 223.7 $ 1,280.0 $ 5,495.9 1 The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as a limited number of contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. 23 Table of Contents 2 We generally order product four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 3 Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through 2006. The amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services. If we were to terminate the entire contract as of May 31, 2004, we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of $18.7 million. Our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate $6 million. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2004. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 — Short-term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2004 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates, generally ninety days from issuance or on demand $ 146.0 Payable to Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America) for the purchase of inventories, generally due sixty days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 43.9 As of May 31, 2004, letters of credit of $551.6 million were outstanding, primarily for the purchase of inventory. All letters of credit generally expire within one year. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under which $1 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium-term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500 million in medium-term notes, as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements. During fiscal 2004, we issued five notes under the medium-term note program totaling $150 million. Four of those notes totaling $100 million have fixed coupon interest rates of 5.15% and mature on October 15, 2015. The other $50 million note has a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.70% and matures on October 1, 2013. For each of the notes, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the three-month or six-month London Inter Bank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. The swaps have the same notional amounts and maturity dates as the notes, and are accounted for as fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133), except for the swap for the $50 million note maturing October 1, 2013. The swap for that note has the same notional amount and fixed coupon interest rate as the note, but expires October 2, 2006. Accordingly, the swap does not qualify for fair value hedge accounting, so changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded in net income each period as a component of other expense, net. After issuance of these notes, $760 million remains available to be issued under the shelf registration. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2005 depending on general corporate needs. 24 Table of Contents As of May 31, 2004, we had a 5-year $750 million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks, and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility. The maturity date is November 20, 2008 and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A and A2 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.22%. The facility fee is 0.08% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, and set a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2004, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2004 or May 31, 2003. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. 25 Table of Contents In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Reserve for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. 26 Table of Contents Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded as other expense, net. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We adopted FAS 142 effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors, including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units. Our estimates may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. As discussed further above, upon adoption of FAS 142 in fiscal 2003, we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $266.1 million. This charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change. Post the first quarter of fiscal 2003, any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change. Other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense, net. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any impairment charges would be classified as other expense, net. 27 Table of Contents Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by FAS 133 have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes significantly, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings declared as reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) being determined in the future to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. 28 Table of Contents Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Therefore, actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts, options and cross-currency swaps to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party or intercompany transactions. When we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months, although at May 31, 2004 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our European and Japanese subsidiaries. We use forward contracts and cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in European currencies, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Korean won, Mexican pesos and Australian dollars. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of medium and long-term fixed rate debt, commercial paper, and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay variable interest. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR 29 Table of Contents computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and hence does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based transactions that are anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $24.9 million and $21.0 million at May 31, 2004 and May 31, 2003, respectively. The increase in VaR as of May 31, 2004 occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the May 31, 2004 VaR computation versus the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the May 31, 2003 VaR computation. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $50.0 million and $43.3 million for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Details of other market-sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below, except the interest rate swaps which are described below. These instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

Intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties. The fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries. There were no significant changes in debt or cross-currency swap market risks during fiscal 2004. Cross-currency swaps outstanding as of May 31, 2003 matured in fiscal 2004 and no new cross-currency swaps were executed during fiscal 2004. The U.S. dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies was $711.8 million at May 31, 2003, which is the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination. The U.S. dollar fair value of the fixed rate Japanese yen denominated debt that was outstanding at May 31, 2003 was $234.5 million versus a carrying value of $190.1 million at that date. The U.S. dollar fair values of the fixed rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, the euro swap payable and the U.S. dollar swap receivable as of May 31, 2003 were $582.2 million, $193.5 million and $211.6 million, respectively, versus carrying values of $540.0 million, $186.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, at that date. In fiscal 2002 we issued a $250 million long-term fixed-rate corporate bond which matures in August 2006. In fiscal 2003 and 2004, we issued an additional $240 million in long-term fixed-rate corporate bonds which mature on various dates beginning in July 2007 through October 2015. Fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 4.7% to 5.66%. For each of the bonds issued in fiscal 2002, 2003 and fiscal 2004, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three-month or six-month LIBOR plus a spread. Each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond, except for one swap for a $50 million bond issued in fiscal 2004 maturing in October 2013. That swap expires in October 2006. As a result of the interest rate swap agreements, the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 2.4% at May 31, 2004 and 2.5% at May 31, 2003. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt, except for the $50 million swap expiring in October 2006 which is not accounted for as a hedge. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period. The recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net $3.3 million gain at May 31, 2004 and a $25.5 million gain at May 31, 2003. The fair value of the $50 million interest rate swap expiring October 2006 was a $0.6 million loss at May 31, 2004. In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.8% and receives variable interest payments based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion Japanese yen. This interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge, accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period. The recorded fair value of the swap was a $0.4 million gain at May 31, 2004 and a $1.0 million loss at May 31, 2003. 31 Table of Contents Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE’s business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKE’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE’s policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. 32 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:03:20.116438
320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE-owned retail stores, independent distributors and licensees, in the United States and over 160 countries worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable portfolio of global footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories brands. Our strategy for building this portfolio is focused in four key areas: • Deepening our relationship with consumers; • Delivering superior, innovative products to the marketplace; • Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline and excellence; and • Accelerating growth through focused execution. By executing this strategy, we aim to deliver the following long-term financial goals: • High single digit revenue growth; • Mid-teens earnings per share growth; • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows; and • Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. In fiscal 2006, we met most of these financial goals. Our revenues grew 9% to $15 billion, net income grew 15% to $1.4 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $5.28, an 18% increase versus fiscal 2005. These reported results included a $51.9 million charge related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling involving our Converse subsidiary (see Note 5 — Accrued Liabilities in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Converse arbitration charge). Excluding this charge, our net income grew 17% and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $5.39, a 20% increase versus fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2006, our consolidated gross margin percentage decreased 50 basis points to 44.0% primarily due to lower in-line net pricing margins (net revenue for current product offerings minus product costs) partially offset by improvements in year-over-year currency hedge rates. The decline in the gross margin percentage and the Converse arbitration charge were more than offset by 80 basis points of selling and administrative expense leverage (due entirely to slowing the growth of operating overhead spending), and higher interest income resulting in a higher pre-tax income margin in fiscal 2006 than in fiscal 2005. In addition, we increased free cash flow from operations and 20 Table of Contents continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases. Our return on invested capital declined slightly as compared to fiscal 2005. Although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, we continue to believe these are appropriate long-term goals.

The U.S. Region contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. Sales in our Other businesses drove the remainder of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Revenues for our Other businesses are comprised substantially of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey and NIKE Golf. 21 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 In fiscal 2005, 3 percentage points of the revenue growth were attributed to changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the stronger euro. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. The U.S. Region contributed 3 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005. Sales in our Other businesses drove the remainder of the improvement of consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005. Converse was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The comparison of a full year of Converse results in fiscal 2005 versus a partial year in fiscal 2004 contributed 1 percentage point to the consolidated revenue growth. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 15 — Acquisitions) for additional information related to the acquisition. Gross Margin 2006 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 6,587.0 $ 6,115.4 8% $ 5,251.7 16% Gross Margin % 44.0 % 44.5 % (50 ) bps 42.9 % 160 bps Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 During fiscal 2006, our consolidated gross margin percentage declined 50 basis points versus the prior year. The primary factors contributing to the reduced gross margin percentage for fiscal 2006 were as follows: (1) Lower footwear in-line net pricing margins in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific regions. The lower footwear in-line net pricing margins were due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices; additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand in the U.S.; higher sales incentives in EMEA and Asia Pacific; strategies to improve consumer value in EMEA and Japan; and a shift in the mix of footwear models sold towards models with lower margins within EMEA and Japan. (2) A shift in the mix of revenues reported from our operating segments towards regions and subsidiaries with lower margins. The factors driving a reduced gross margin percentage were partially offset by: (1) Year-over-year currency hedge rate improvements, primarily for the euro. (2) Improved gross margin percentages in our Other businesses driven by improvements at Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 During fiscal 2005, our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 160 basis points versus the prior year. The primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2005 were as follows: (1) Higher gross margins in our international regions, driven primarily by our EMEA Region. This improvement was driven by changes in currency hedge rates, primarily the euro, partially offset by lower in-line net pricing margins and a higher percentage of less profitable closeout sales (non-current product offerings) in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. The lower in-line net pricing margins were due to strategies to improve consumer value. The increased levels of closeout sales and lower closeout pricing were the result of the liquidation of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. 22 Table of Contents (2) Higher gross margins in the U.S. Region primarily due to fewer, more profitable closeouts in footwear partially offset by increased sales discounts and higher costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand. (3) Improved gross margin percentages in our Other businesses driven by the addition of Converse (acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2004) and Exeter Brands Group (formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005). Both Exeter Brands Group and the international portion of Converse’s business operate on a licensing model, which carries higher gross margins and lower operating expenses than the remainder of our Other businesses. Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 Change (In millions) Demand creation expense* $ 1,740.2 $ 1,600.7 9% $ 1,377.9 16% Operating overhead expense 2,737.6 2,621.0 4% 2,324.1 13% Selling and administrative expense 4,477.8 4,221.7 6% 3,702.0 14% % of Revenues 29.9 % 30.7 % (80) bps 30.2 % 50 bps * Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In fiscal 2006, selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues by 80 basis points for the year driven by operating overhead leverage. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced selling and administrative expense growth by 1 percentage point. In fiscal 2006, changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in demand creation by 1 percentage point. The growth in demand creation spending in fiscal 2006 was in line with our revenue growth. The year-over-year increase in demand creation spending was primarily due to increased spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and events, increased spending on retail marketing programs (in-store marketing at our retail partners), and advertising primarily around the global World Cup and Winter Olympics campaigns and for the global Air Max 360™ footwear launch. While consolidated revenues grew 9% in fiscal 2006, operating overhead for fiscal 2006 increased only 4% over fiscal 2005 as a result of expense management strategies to slow the growth of operating overhead spending. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in operating overhead by 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the increase in operating overhead for fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs (both increased headcount and higher compensation) to support the growth of our business, including our Other businesses and new NIKE-owned retail stores. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 In fiscal 2005, 3 percentage points of the selling and administrative expense increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates. The impact of a full fiscal year for Converse and the formation of Exeter Brands Group added 1 percentage point of growth. In fiscal 2005, 3 percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and 23 Table of Contents events primarily in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, higher advertising spending primarily in the EMEA Region, and increased spending on retail marketing programs in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. The addition of Converse and formation of Exeter Brands Group also contributed to the demand creation increase for the year. Changes in currency exchange rates contributed 3 percentage points of the increase to operating overhead expense in fiscal 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, operating overhead increases for fiscal 2005 were mainly attributable to higher personnel costs (both increased headcount and higher compensation), investments in emerging markets (such as China, India and our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit) and our Other businesses, increased costs due to sales and leadership events and higher spending associated with new NIKE-owned retail stores. Other Expense, net Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Other Expense, net $ 4.4 $ 29.1 (85 )% $ 74.7 (61 )% Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The significant reduction in Other expense, net for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006 compared to foreign currency hedge losses in the prior year, partially offset by the Converse arbitration charge. The fiscal 2006 hedge gains primarily reflected that the euro had weakened since we entered into these hedge contracts and are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information). In fiscal 2006, these net foreign currency hedge gains were partially offset by unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge gains in other expense, net, and the unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $55 million for fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 The most significant component of other expense, net, of $29.1 million for fiscal 2005 was foreign currency hedge losses. The hedge losses reflected that the euro had strengthened since we entered into these hedge contracts. In fiscal 2004, foreign currency hedge losses were also the most significant component of other expense, net, of $74.7 million. The year-over-year improvement in other expense, net, for fiscal 2005 was mainly due to lower foreign currency hedge losses and lower net losses on asset disposals compared to those recorded in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, these net foreign currency losses in other expense, net, were more than offset by favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other expense, net, and the favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $95 million for fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 Change Effective Tax Rate 35.0 % 34.9 % 10 bps 34.8 % 10 bps Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was consistent with the rate reported for fiscal 2005. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, our CEO and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. by providing an 85% dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. A $500 million repatriation was made during the quarter ending May 31, 2006 comprised of both foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes has previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the provisions made did not have a material impact on the Company’s income tax expense or effective tax rate for the year. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was slightly higher than the fiscal 2004 rate primarily due to decreases in tax credits partially offset by lower taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal 2005. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we decided to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings during fiscal 2006 under the Act. As discussed above, because we elected to repatriate a combination of foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes had previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested, the provisions made did not have a material impact on our income tax expense or our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005. Futures Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2006 were 5.0% higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2005. This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. The net effect from changes in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on this reported growth versus the same period last year. Slightly higher average selling prices for both footwear and apparel contributed approximately 1 percentage point of the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The remaining 4 percentage points of the increase were due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and closeout sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team apparel, Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands. 25 Table of Contents Operating Segments The breakdown of revenues follows: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) U.S. Region Footwear $ 3,832.2 $ 3,358.2 14 % $ 3,070.4 9 % Apparel 1,591.6 1,457.7 9 % 1,433.5 2 % Equipment 298.7 313.4 (5 )% 277.9 13 % Total U.S 5,722.5 5,129.3 12 % 4,781.8 7 % EMEA Region Footwear 2,454.3 2,500.0 (2 )% 2,232.2 12 % Apparel 1,559.0 1,497.1 4 % 1,333.8 12 % Equipment 313.3 284.5 10 % 261.7 9 % Total EMEA 4,326.6 4,281.6 1 % 3,827.7 12 % Asia Pacific Region Footwear 1,044.1 962.9 8 % 855.3 13 % Apparel 815.6 755.5 8 % 612.3 23 % Equipment 194.1 178.9 8 % 143.2 25 % Total Asia Pacific 2,053.8 1,897.3 8 % 1,610.8 18 % Americas Region Footwear 635.3 478.6 33 % 408.2 17 % Apparel 201.8 169.1 19 % 159.5 6 % Equipment 67.8 48.1 41 % 36.8 31 % Total Americas 904.9 695.8 30 % 604.5 15 % 13,007.8 12,004.0 8 % 10,824.8 11 % Other 1,947.1 1,735.7 12 % 1,428.3 22 % Total Revenues $ 14,954.9 $ 13,739.7 9 % $ 12,253.1 12 % The breakdown of income before income taxes (“pre-tax income”) follows: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) U.S. Region $ 1,244.5 $ 1,127.9 10 % $ 1,007.3 12 % EMEA Region 960.7 917.5 5 % 744.0 23 % Asia Pacific Region 412.5 399.8 3 % 352.3 13 % Americas Region 172.6 116.5 48 % 97.4 20 % Other 151.6 151.4 — % 75.3 101 % Corporate (800.3 ) (853.3 ) 6 % (826.3 ) (3 )% Total Pre-tax Income $ 2,141.6 $ 1,859.8 15 % $ 1,450.0 28 % ** Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2006 presentation.

We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” As discussed in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre-tax income of our operating segments. U.S. Region Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 3,832.2 $ 3,358.2 14 % $ 3,070.4 9 % Apparel 1,591.6 1,457.7 9 % 1,433.5 2 % Equipment 298.7 313.4 (5 )% 277.9 13 % Total Revenues $ 5,722.5 $ 5,129.3 12 % $ 4,781.8 7 % Pre-tax Income $ 1,244.5 $ 1,127.9 10 % $ 1,007.3 12 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The increase in footwear revenues was due to a strong increase in unit sales, accounting for 12 percentage points of the growth, and an increase in the average selling price per pair, accounting for 2 percentage points of the growth. The strong unit increase was driven by increased consumer demand across a majority of the footwear product categories, most significantly high demand for our Jordan branded and sport culture products. The higher average selling price per pair was primarily due to increased consumer demand for products with a suggested retail price over $100, driven by Jordan branded products as well as NIKE branded sport performance and sport culture products. The increase in U.S. apparel sales for fiscal 2006 was driven by increased unit sales in NIKE and Jordan branded apparel, partially offset by sales declines in licensed apparel, primarily due to the expiration of our license agreement with the NBA in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The increases in NIKE branded apparel were primarily due to increased sales of sport performance products. For the U.S. Region, the increase in pre-tax income for fiscal 2006 as compared to 2005 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in-line net pricing margins for footwear due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices, and additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. The increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased advertising, primarily due to the global campaigns discussed above. The increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending for new NIKE-owned retail stores, higher personnel costs and higher travel and meeting expenses. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 The increase in footwear revenue was due to a 5 percentage point increase in unit sales and a 4 percentage point increase in the average price per pair. The increases in unit sales and the average price per pair were due to increased consumer demand for sport performance products, especially those with a suggested retail price over $100. 27 Table of Contents The increase in apparel sales for fiscal 2005 was driven by volume increases in branded apparel, partially offset by a decline in revenue from sales of licensed apparel. The decline in revenue from licensed apparel was due to the expiration of our license agreement with the NBA, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, and a shift in consumer preference towards branded apparel. For fiscal 2005, higher revenues, an improved gross margin percentage, and slightly lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues drove the U.S. Region pre-tax income increase. The improved gross margin percentage was primarily the result of fewer, more profitable closeout sales partially offset by increased sales discounts (the result of increased sales to high volume accounts) and higher costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2004, but represented a slightly smaller percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. The increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased retail marketing spending. The increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending on personnel costs and new NIKE-owned retail stores and higher costs related to sales and leadership events. EMEA Region Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 2,454.3 $ 2,500.0 (2 )% $ 2,232.2 12 % Apparel 1,559.0 1,497.1 4 % 1,333.8 12 % Equipment 313.3 284.5 10 % 261.7 9 % Total Revenues $ 4,326.6 $ 4,281.6 1 % $ 3,827.7 12 % Pre-tax Income $ 960.7 $ 917.5 5 % $ 744.0 23 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2006. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all three product business units grew. Excluding currency changes, the increase in footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales partially offset by declines in the average selling price per pair. The increased unit sales were driven by increased demand for sport culture products. The declines in the average selling price per pair were due in part to changes in the mix of in-line products sold towards products with a lower average selling price and higher sales incentives as a result of a difficult retail environment in Western Europe. The increase in EMEA apparel revenue was driven by increased unit sales and average selling prices of NIKE branded apparel, primarily increased unit sales of sport performance products, including soccer products driven by the World Cup, and increased average selling prices across most apparel categories. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, sales increases in the emerging markets of our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit led the revenue growth, while sales increases in Western and Northern Europe also contributed to the EMEA sales growth for fiscal 2006. The increase in pre-tax income for the EMEA Region for fiscal 2006 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable foreign currency translation versus fiscal 2005. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in-line net pricing margins in footwear and apparel, partially offset by improved year-over-year hedge rates. The lower in-line net pricing margins for footwear were due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices, higher sales incentives, strategies to improve consumer value, and a shift in the mix of products sold towards products with lower margins. The reduced in-line net pricing margins for 28 Table of Contents apparel were primarily due to higher product costs and higher sales incentives. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than in fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. Excluding currency changes, the increase in selling and administrative costs was driven by higher demand creation expenses partially offset by slightly lower operating overhead expenses. The higher demand creation expenses were primarily due to spending related to the World Cup campaign and increased spending on retail marketing programs. The slightly lower operating overhead expenses were due to lower spending on travel and meeting expenses, lower bad debt expense and slightly lower personnel costs related to our wholesale business, partially offset by increased spending to support the growth of NIKE-owned retail stores. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 For EMEA, changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 7 percentage points of the reported revenue growth in fiscal 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, all three product business units grew. Excluding currency changes, the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increased unit sales of footwear, apparel and equipment partially offset by declines in the average prices in each of the product business units. For fiscal 2005, excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales increases in the emerging markets in our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit, along with sales increases in the UK and Italy, drove the growth. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in France, Germany and Northern Europe. The increase in pre-tax income in the EMEA region in fiscal 2005 was driven by higher revenues and gross margin improvements, more than offsetting increased selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. The improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved year-over-year hedge rates partially offset by reduced in-line net pricing margins (due to strategies to improve consumer value) and higher, less profitable closeout sales (the result of the liquidation of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories). The increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. The increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased advertising and higher spending on sports marketing endorsements and events. The increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending on personnel costs to support the growth of our wholesale business and new NIKE-owned retail stores and higher costs related to sales and leadership events. Asia Pacific Region Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,044.1 $ 962.9 8 % $ 855.3 13 % Apparel 815.6 755.5 8 % 612.3 23 % Equipment 194.1 178.9 8 % 143.2 25 % Total Revenues $ 2,053.8 $ 1,897.3 8 % $ 1,610.8 18 % Pre-tax Income $ 412.5 $ 399.8 3 % $ 352.3 13 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 1 percentage point for fiscal 2006. Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for each Asia Pacific product business unit were higher than fiscal 2005. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales (driven by increased unit sales across most countries and categories), partially offset by lower average selling prices (due to strategies to improve consumer value in Japan). The increase in apparel revenues was driven by increases across sport performance and sport culture categories. Increased revenue in 29 Table of Contents China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) was the primary growth driver for fiscal 2006, partially offset by lower sales in Japan driven by lower average selling prices due to investments in consumer value and a challenging retail marketplace. The increase in fiscal 2006 pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower in-line net pricing margins due to higher footwear product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices; strategies to improve consumer value for footwear in Japan; and a shift in the mix of footwear and apparel products sold in Japan toward products with lower margins. Selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in demand creation, primarily driven by spending related to the World Cup campaign, and slightly higher operating overhead, primarily due to higher personnel costs to support growth in China. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 In the Asia Pacific Region, 4 percentage points of reported revenue growth for fiscal 2005 were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Asia Pacific product business unit grew versus fiscal 2004 with the growth primarily due to unit volume; average price per unit increased slightly. Excluding currency changes, significant revenue increases in China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) and increases in every other country in the region except Australia and New Zealand were the key growth drivers for fiscal 2005. The increase in pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region in fiscal 2005 was driven by higher revenues, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. The reduced gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less profitable closeout sales and lower in-line net pricing margins due to strategies to improve the consumer value in Japan, partially offset by better year-over-year currency hedge rates. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to increases in both demand creation (driven by higher spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased spending on retail marketing programs) and operating overhead (driven by increased spending on personnel costs to support the growth of our business and higher costs related to sales and leadership events). Americas Region Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 635.3 $ 478.6 33 % $ 408.2 17 % Apparel 201.8 169.1 19 % 159.5 6 % Equipment 67.8 48.1 41 % 36.8 31 % Total Revenues $ 904.9 $ 695.8 30 % $ 604.5 15 % Pre-tax Income $ 172.6 $ 116.5 48 % $ 97.4 20 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In the Americas Region, 11 percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal 2006 were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Even excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2006. The revenue growth was driven by increased sales in every country in the region, with significant sales increases in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. 30 Table of Contents The increase in fiscal 2006 pre-tax income for the Americas Region was attributable to higher revenues, an improved gross margin percentage, lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues and favorable currency translation. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2006. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in both demand creation (due to increased sports marketing endorsement contracts, and increased advertising spending and retail marketing programs primarily related to the World Cup campaign) and operating overhead (driven by increased personnel costs as a result of continued expansion of the business across the region). Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 In the Americas Region, 1 percentage point of the revenue growth for fiscal 2005 was due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency, sales in each Americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2005. The revenue growth was driven primarily by higher sales in Central and South America, partially offset by lower sales in Canada. The increase in fiscal 2005 pre-tax income for the Americas Region was attributable to higher revenues and an improved gross margin percentage, partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in both demand creation (due to increased spending on sports marketing endorsement contract and events, advertising and retail marketing programs) and operating overhead (driven by increased personnel costs). Other Businesses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues $ 1,947.1 $ 1,735.7 12 % $ 1,428.3 22 % Pre-tax Income $ 151.6 $ 151.4 — % $ 75.3 101 % Converse arbitration charge 51.9 — — Pre-tax Income, excluding the Converse arbitration charge $ 203.5 $ 151.4 34 % $ 75.3 101 % We are providing pre-tax income excluding the Converse arbitration charge to enhance the visibility of the underlying earnings trend excluding this identifiable expense. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenue increases for our Other businesses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 were driven primarily by growth at Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Pre-tax income from the Other businesses for fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005 and included a $51.9 million charge related to the unfavorable arbitration ruling involving a licensing agreement contract dispute with our Converse subsidiary and a former South American licensee. This charge reduced reported pre-tax income for the Other businesses by 34 percentage points. Excluding the Converse arbitration charge, the pre-tax income improvement was driven by improved profitability at Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf, partially offset by a loss at NIKE Bauer Hockey. The loss at NIKE Bauer Hockey was largely the result of costs incurred in connection with a re-branding initiative. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 For fiscal 2005, the addition of Converse, acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, and the formation of Exeter Brands Group, formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to develop the Company’s business in retail 31 Table of Contents channels serving value-conscious consumers and to operate the business obtained in the acquisition of Official Starter Properties LLC and Official Starter LLC (collectively “Official Starter”), together drove 12 percentage points of the Other business revenue increase of 22% over fiscal 2004. The remainder of the increase was driven by revenue growth at Cole Haan, Hurley and NIKE Golf. The year-over-year improvement in fiscal 2005 pre-tax income from the Other businesses was driven by the addition of Converse, improved results from Cole Haan and NIKE Bauer Hockey and the formation of the Exeter Brands Group. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2006 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006, compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2005. Our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of $1.4 billion. For fiscal 2006, our net investment in working capital increased $43.2 million as compared to an increase of $13.0 million in fiscal 2005. This increased investment in working capital was largely attributable to a larger increase in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in inventories reflects higher in-transit inventories (due primarily to growth in reported futures and other orders, and earlier product ordering compared to last year) and higher inventories to support the expansion of NIKE-owned retail stores. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased in fiscal 2006 compared to a decrease in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of payments, including earlier payments of income taxes in certain foreign locations. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year. Cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2006 was $1.3 billion, compared to $360.4 million invested during fiscal 2005. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to a higher net increase in short-term investments (purchases net of maturities), which increased from $35.3 million in fiscal 2005 to $909.9 million in fiscal 2006, and increased net additions to property, plant and equipment. The additions to property, plant and equipment primarily reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software (to support both normal business operations and our supply chain systems upgrade), and continued investment in NIKE-owned retail stores. In fiscal 2006, we purchased approximately 9.5 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $781.2 million. The share repurchases were part of a four-year, $1.5 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2004. Since the inception of this program, we have repurchased 16.4 million shares, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. In June 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new four-year, $3.0 billion share repurchase program, to commence upon completion of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2006 were $1.18, compared to $0.95 in fiscal 2005. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. Our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20% to 30% of the trailing twelve-months’ earnings per share, paid out on a quarterly basis. We review our dividend policy from time to time, and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements, we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and 32 Table of Contents Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2006 are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ended May 31, Description of Commitment 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 229.0 $ 190.6 $ 158.8 $ 129.9 $ 116.9 $ 599.3 $ 1,424.5 Long-term Debt 255.9 31.0 6.0 30.9 6.0 341.8 671.6 Endorsement Contracts(1) 476.5 349.6 241.2 160.8 108.0 306.0 1,642.1 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 1,850.4 1.0 — — — — 1,851.4 Other(3) 196.3 53.0 39.5 12.6 10.6 1.3 313.3 Total $ 3,008.1 $ 625.2 $ 445.5 $ 334.2 $ 241.5 $ 1,248.4 $ 5,902.9 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2006. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2006. Excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through fiscal 2008. The amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services. If we were to terminate the entire contract as of May 31, 2006, we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of $18.7 million. Our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate $6 million. 33 Table of Contents We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2006. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 — Short-term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as of May 31, 2006 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates, generally ninety days from issuance or on demand $ 43.4 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 69.7 As of May 31, 2006, letters of credit of $347.6 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Most letters of credit expire within one year. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under which $1 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium-term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500 million in medium-term notes, as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the medium-term note program we have issued $240.0 million in medium-term notes. During fiscal 2006, there were no medium-term notes issued under the program. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2007 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2006, we had a multi-year $750 million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks, and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility. The maturity date is November 20, 2008 and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A2 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.18%. The facility fee is 0.07% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, and set a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2006, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2006 or May 31, 2005. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” 34 Table of Contents (“FAS 151”). FAS 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. The provisions of FAS 151 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. We have evaluated the provisions of FAS 151 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. On December 16, 2004, the FASB finalized SFAS No. 123R “Share Based Payment,” (“FAS 123R”) which, after the SEC amended the compliance dates on April 15, 2005, is effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. The new standard will require us to record compensation expense for stock options using a fair value method. On March 29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”), which provides the Staff’s views regarding interactions between FAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. We plan to adopt the new requirements under FAS 123R and SAB 107 beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective transition method and the Black-Scholes fair value model. As a result of the adoption of FAS 123R, we will recognize additional compensation expense of approximately $0.36 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. The amount of expense that will be recognized is largely dependent on several variables, including the level of share-based payments that will be granted during the fiscal year in addition to the assumptions used in the valuation model. Accordingly, the actual effect per diluted share could differ from this estimate. The effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 using the Black-Scholes model is presented in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies). Under certain conditions, stock options granted by the Company are eligible for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the employee. The FASB clarified in FAS 123R that the fair value of such stock options should be expensed based on the applicable accelerated vesting schedule, rather than ratably over the vesting period stated in the grant. Our pro forma disclosure currently reflects the expense of such options ratably over the stated vesting period, expensing all unvested shares upon actual retirement. The SEC clarified that companies should continue to follow the vesting method they have been using until adoption of FAS 123R, then apply the accelerated vesting schedule to all subsequent grants to those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement. Had we been accounting for such stock options using the accelerated vesting schedule for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement, we would have recognized additional stock-based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure of the effect of expensing stock options presented in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies) of $0.01 per diluted share in fiscal 2006 and $0.05 per diluted share in fiscal 2005 and 2004. We usually grant the majority of stock options in a single grant in the first three months of each fiscal year. As a result, accelerated vesting will normally result in higher expense in the first three months and lower expense in the last nine months of each fiscal year, as compared to the pro forma expense we disclosed under our current policy of expensing such options ratably over the stated vesting period. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FIN 48. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 35 Table of Contents We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Reserve for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our 36 Table of Contents inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded as other expense, net. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in 37 Table of Contents the fourth fiscal quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors, including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units. Our estimates may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. Any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite-lived intangible assets would be classified as other expense, net. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any impairment charges would be classified as other expense, net. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted (“FAS 133”) have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes significantly, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. 38 Table of Contents We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Therefore, actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. When we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months, although at May 31, 2006 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our European and Japanese subsidiaries. We use forward contracts to hedge 39 Table of Contents non-functional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Korean won, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of medium and long-term fixed rate debt, commercial paper, and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $17.5 million and $25.7 million at May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2005, respectively. The decrease in VaR as of May 31, 2006 occurred due to a lower notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of May 31, 2006 compared to May 31, 2005. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $34.9 million and $37.2 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Details of other market-sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below, except the interest rate swaps which are described below. These instruments include intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

Intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties, as discussed above. 41 Table of Contents The fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries. There were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal 2006. We did not issue any long-term fixed-rate corporate bonds during fiscal 2006 or 2005; however, in previous years we issued a total of $490 million in long-term fixed-rate corporate bonds that mature between August 2006 and October 2015. Fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 4.7% to 5.66%. For each of the bonds issued, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three-month or six-month LIBOR plus a spread. As a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 6.07% at May 31, 2006 and 4.17% at May 31, 2005. For $440 million of the issued bonds, the associated swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt. The remaining $50 million bond matures in October 2013 whereas the associated interest rate swap expires in October 2006. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period. The recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net $5.6 million loss at May 31, 2006 and a $9.0 million gain at May 31, 2005. The change in fair value of the $50 million interest rate swap expiring October 2006 was not material for the years ended May 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.8% and receives variable interest payments based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion Japanese yen. This interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge, accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period. The change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended May 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.",2023-12-30 18:03:14.390874
320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE-owned retail, including stores and e-commerce, and independent distributors and licensees in the United States and worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories. Through this diverse portfolio of brands, our strategy is to create long-term revenue growth by connecting with consumers across geographies. We strive to convert revenue growth to value in three key areas: • Creating the marketplace: • Delivering premium experiences to our consumers • Delivering superior, innovative products to the marketplace • Operational and organizational excellence: • Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline and excellence • Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing designed to eliminate waste • Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin • Improving working capital efficiency • Deploying capital effectively: • Utilizing capital capacity to create value for our shareholders By executing this strategy, we aim to deliver the following long-term financial goals: • High single-digit revenue growth; • Mid-teens earnings per share growth; 22 Table of Contents • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows; and • Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. In fiscal 2007, we met the majority of these financial goals. Our revenues grew 9% to $16.3 billion, net income grew 7% to $1.5 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.93, an 11% increase versus fiscal 2006. These reported results included a $141.9 million pre-tax charge, related to stock-based compensation expense recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123R”), which we adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 (see Note 1— Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10 — Common Stock in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of FAS 123R), and the effects of the Converse arbitration ruling in fiscal 2006 and subsequent settlement in fiscal 2007. Excluding these items, our net income grew 11% and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.10, a 15% increase versus fiscal 2006 (see Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding the Converse Arbitration and Stock-Based Compensation Expense below). Fiscal 2007 results were positively affected by a reduction in our effective tax rate of 2.8 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of the European tax agreement the Company finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. For the year, the increase in net income was below our rate of revenue growth due to higher selling and administrative expenses versus the same period in the prior year. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to the adoption of FAS 123R and higher investments in growth drivers such as demand creation and operating overhead. Our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program. In addition, we increased cash flow from operations and continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases. Our return on invested capital declined slightly as compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R. Although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, we continue to believe these are appropriate long-term goals.

Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues $ 16,325.9 $ 14,954.9 9 % $ 13,739.7 9 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth. Strong demand for NIKE brand products continued to drive revenue growth, as all four of our geographic regions and, on a consolidated basis, all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, both the U.S. Region and our international regions each contributed more than 2.5 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2007. Our Other businesses, comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley International, NIKE Bauer Hockey, and NIKE Golf contributed the remaining 2 percentage points of the consolidated constant-currency revenue growth, as each business within the group posted higher revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE brand footwear revenue grew 7% and contributed nearly $550 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2007. Our worldwide NIKE brand equipment and apparel businesses reported revenue growth of 12% and 10% for the year, respectively, and combined added more than $500 million of incremental revenue. 24 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In fiscal 2006, changes in currency exchange rates reduced reported consolidated revenue growth by 1 percentage point. The U.S. Region contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. Sales in our Other businesses drove the remainder of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Gross Margin Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 7,160.5 $ 6,587.0 9% $ 6,115.4 8% Gross Margin % 43.9 % 44.0 % (10) bps 44.5 % (50) bps Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows: (1) Lower footwear net pricing margins in the U.S. and Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) Regions, primarily due to sales discounts, combined with a higher closeout mix; partially offset by (2) Favorable hedge results relative to the prior year, primarily in the Asia Pacific Region; (3) Better inventory management, most notably in our Asia Pacific Region; and (4) Improved gross margins in our Other businesses, driven primarily by the growth in Converse’s international licensing business, partially offset by the expected effects of the transition in Exeter’s business from a licensing model to a wholesale model. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 During fiscal 2006, our consolidated gross margin percentage declined 50 basis points versus the prior year. The primary factors contributing to the reduced gross margin percentage for fiscal 2006 were as follows: (1) Lower footwear in-line net pricing margins in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific Regions. The lower footwear in-line net pricing margins were due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices; additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand in the U.S.; higher sales incentives in EMEA and Asia Pacific; strategies to improve consumer value in EMEA and Japan; and a shift in the mix of footwear models sold towards models with lower margins within EMEA and Japan. (2) A shift in the mix of revenues reported from our operating segments towards regions and subsidiaries with lower margins. The factors driving a reduced gross margin percentage were partially offset by: (1) Year-over-year currency hedge rate improvements, primarily for the euro. (2) Improved gross margin percentages in our Other businesses driven by improvements at Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. 25 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change (In millions) Operating overhead expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense $ 2,974.4 $ 2,737.6 9% $ 2,621.0 4% Stock-based compensation expense(1) 141.9 — — — — Operating overhead expense, as reported 3,116.3 2,737.6 14% 2,621.0 4% Demand creation expense(2) 1,912.4 1,740.2 10% 1,600.7 9% Selling and administrative expense 5,028.7 4,477.8 12% 4,221.7 6% % of Revenues 30.8 % 29.9 % 90 bps 30.7 % (80) bps * This schedule is intended to satisfy the quantitative reconciliation for non-GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G of the SEC. In addition, this schedule is provided to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding this identifiable expense by presenting our results for fiscal 2007 using the same accounting policy for stock-based compensation expense applied during the comparable prior year periods. (1) This charge relates to stock-based compensation associated with stock options and ESPP shares issued to employees and expensed in accordance with FAS 123R. We adopted FAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective transition method. While this expense was not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005, it will continue to be reflected in future accounting periods. (2) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 90 basis points; however, excluding the $141.9 million pre-tax charge relating to the change in accounting for stock-based compensation, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was consistent with the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, demand creation expense increased 7% versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to investments in the NIKE Air®, NIKE+, NIKE Pro, and Force Basketball campaigns. For fiscal year 2007, constant-currency growth in demand creation expense was consistent with our constant-currency revenue growth. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and the effects of changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 7%, which was in line with our constant-currency revenue growth. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE-owned retail and non-NIKE brands, as well as normal wage inflation. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In fiscal 2006, selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues by 80 basis points for the year driven by operating overhead leverage. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced selling and administrative expense growth by 1 percentage point. In fiscal 2006, changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in demand creation by 1 percentage point. The growth in demand creation spending in fiscal 2006 was in line with our revenue growth. The year-over-year increase in demand creation spending was primarily due to increased spending on sports 26 Table of Contents marketing endorsement contracts and events, increased spending on retail marketing programs (in-store marketing at our retail partners), and advertising primarily around the global World Cup and Winter Olympics campaigns and for the global Air Max 360™ footwear launch. While consolidated revenues grew 9% in fiscal 2006, operating overhead for fiscal 2006 increased only 4% over fiscal 2005 as a result of expense management strategies to slow the growth of operating overhead spending. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in operating overhead by 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the increase in operating overhead for fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs (both increased headcount and higher compensation) to support the growth of our business, including our Other businesses and new NIKE-owned retail stores. Other (Income) Expense, net Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Other (income) expense, net $ (0.9 ) $ 4.4 (120 )% $ 29.1 (85 )% Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Other (income) expense, net is comprised substantially of gains and losses associated with the conversion of non-functional currency receivables and payables, the re-measurement of foreign currency derivative instruments, disposals of fixed assets, as well as other unusual or non-recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2007, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of the $14.7 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our Oregon footwear distribution center and the $14.2 million benefit from the settlement of the Converse arbitration, offset by foreign currency hedge losses. The foreign currency hedge losses recognized in fiscal 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the euro since we entered into these hedge contracts. The change in other (income) expense, net versus the prior year period was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal 2007, which were more than offset by the Converse arbitration settlement and gain on the sale of our Oregon footwear distribution center discussed above, compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006, which were more than offset by the $51.9 million charge taken during the fourth quarter as a result of the Converse arbitration. Foreign currency hedge gains and losses reported in other (income) expense, net are reflected in the Corporate line, the gain on the sale of the Oregon footwear distribution center is reflected in the U.S. Region line, and the Converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the Other line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information). In fiscal 2007, the net foreign currency hedge losses discussed above were partially offset by favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most notably in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other (income) expense, net, and the favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits did not have a significant impact on consolidated income before income taxes for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The significant reduction in other (income) expense, net for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006 compared to foreign currency hedge losses in the prior year, partially offset by the Converse arbitration charge. The fiscal 2006 hedge gains primarily reflected that the euro had weakened since we entered into these hedge contracts. 27 Table of Contents In fiscal 2006, these net foreign currency hedge gains were partially offset by unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge gains in other (income) expense, net, and the unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $55 million for fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year. Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change Effective tax rate 32.2 % 35.0 % (280) bps 34.9 % 10 bps Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits from our operations outside the United States; our tax rate on these operations is generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. These benefits included the 10-year European tax agreement finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, which is effective for fiscal years 2006 through 2015. This agreement, which provided a retroactive tax benefit for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007, favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was consistent with the rate reported for fiscal 2005. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, our CEO and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. by providing an 85% dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. A $500 million repatriation was made during the quarter ended May 31, 2006 comprised of both foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the provisions made did not have a material impact on the Company’s income tax expense or effective tax rate for the year. Futures Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2007 were nearly 12% higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2006. This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. The net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 1 percentage point to this reported futures growth versus the same period in the prior year. Excluding this currency impact, unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and closeout sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands. 28 Table of Contents Operating Segments The breakdown of revenues follows: Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) U.S. Region Footwear $ 4,067.2 $ 3,832.2 6 % $ 3,358.2 14 % Apparel 1,716.1 1,591.6 8 % 1,457.7 9 % Equipment 323.8 298.7 8 % 313.4 (5 )% Total U.S 6,107.1 5,722.5 7 % 5,129.3 12 % EMEA Region Footwear 2,608.0 2,454.3 6 % 2,500.0 (2 )% Apparel 1,757.2 1,559.0 13 % 1,497.1 4 % Equipment 358.1 313.3 14 % 284.5 10 % Total EMEA 4,723.3 4,326.6 9 % 4,281.6 1 % Asia Pacific Region Footwear 1,159.2 1,044.1 11 % 962.9 8 % Apparel 909.3 815.6 11 % 755.5 8 % Equipment 214.9 194.1 11 % 178.9 8 % Total Asia Pacific 2,283.4 2,053.8 11 % 1,897.3 8 % Americas Region Footwear 679.6 635.3 7 % 478.6 33 % Apparel 193.9 201.8 (4 )% 169.1 19 % Equipment 79.0 67.8 17 % 48.1 41 % Total Americas 952.5 904.9 5 % 695.8 30 % 14,066.3 13,007.8 8 % 12,004.0 8 % Other 2,259.6 1,947.1 16 % 1,735.7 12 % Total Revenues $ 16,325.9 $ 14,954.9 9 % $ 13,739.7 9 % The breakdown of income before income taxes (“pre-tax income”) follows: Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006(1) FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005(1) FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) U.S. Region $ 1,300.3 $ 1,244.5 4 % $ 1,127.9 10 % EMEA Region 1,000.7 960.7 4 % 917.5 5 % Asia Pacific Region 483.7 412.5 17 % 399.8 3 % Americas Region 187.4 172.6 9 % 116.5 48 % Other 303.7 153.6 98 % 154.8 (1 )% Corporate (1,075.9 ) (802.3 ) (34 )% (856.7 ) 6 % Total Pre-tax Income $ 2,199.9 $ 2,141.6 3 % $ 1,859.8 15 % (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2007 presentation.

We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” As discussed in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre-tax income of our operating segments. U.S. Region Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 4,067.2 $ 3,832.2 6 % $ 3,358.2 14 % Apparel 1,716.1 1,591.6 8 % 1,457.7 9 % Equipment 323.8 298.7 8 % 313.4 (5 )% Total Revenues $ 6,107.1 $ 5,722.5 7 % $ 5,129.3 12 % Pre-tax Income $ 1,300.3 $ 1,244.5 4 % $ 1,127.9 10 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was attributable to high single-digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture products; kids’ product, including boys and girls sport culture; Brand Jordan products; and men’s running products, due to the growth of our Nike+ performance models. The decrease in average selling price per pair compared to the prior year was the result of a higher mix of off-price products, combined with growth in lower priced kids’ product. The year-over-year increase in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2007 reflected mid single-digit growth in unit sales combined with a low single-digit increase in average price per unit. The increase in unit sales versus the prior year was driven by double-digit growth in NIKE brand sport performance apparel, while the improvement in average selling prices was driven by team and licensed apparel and Brand Jordan products. Pre-tax income for the U.S. Region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2007 as a result of lower gross margins. The gross margin decline was primarily attributable to a higher level of closeout sales and sales discounts compared to the prior year, most notably in our footwear business. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2006, but represented a lower percentage of revenue due to operating overhead leverage. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 During fiscal 2006, the increase in footwear revenues was due to a double-digit growth in unit sales, combined with low single-digit growth in the average selling price per pair. The strong unit increase was driven by increased consumer demand across a majority of the footwear product categories, most significantly high demand for our Jordan branded and sport culture products. The higher average selling price per pair was primarily due to increased consumer demand for products with a suggested retail price over $100, driven by Jordan branded products as well as NIKE branded sport performance and sport culture products. The increase in U.S. apparel sales for fiscal 2006 was driven by increased unit sales in NIKE and Jordan branded apparel, partially offset by sales declines in licensed apparel, primarily due to the expiration of our license agreement with the NBA in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The increases in NIKE branded apparel were primarily due to increased sales of sport performance products. 30 Table of Contents For the U.S. Region, the increase in pre-tax income for fiscal 2006 as compared to 2005 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in-line net pricing margins for footwear due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices, and additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. The increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased advertising, primarily due to the global campaigns discussed above. The increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending for new NIKE-owned retail stores, higher personnel costs and higher travel and meeting expenses. EMEA Region Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 2,608.0 $ 2,454.3 6 % $ 2,500.0 (2 )% Apparel 1,757.2 1,559.0 13 % 1,497.1 4 % Equipment 358.1 313.3 14 % 284.5 10 % Total Revenues $ 4,723.3 $ 4,326.6 9 % $ 4,281.6 1 % Pre-tax Income $ 1,000.7 $ 960.7 4 % $ 917.5 5 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2007. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all markets within the region except the U.K. and France increased revenues during the year. The emerging markets in the region grew over 30%, driven by strong results in Greece, Russia, Turkey and South Africa. Increases in Northern Europe, Italy and Spain also contributed significantly to the revenue growth. After experiencing challenging retail conditions in the U.K. and France during fiscal 2007, we have started to see signs of improvement in these markets, including year-over-year futures growth. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 1 percentage point during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to low single-digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture products, most notably “metro” and outdoor products. The growth in unit sales more than offset a decline in the average selling price per pair, which resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product styles, combined with an increase in closeout sales. Excluding changes in exchange rates, apparel revenues increased 7 percentage points during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected high single-digit growth in unit sales, driven by both sports culture and sports performance products, combined with a low single-digit increase in average price per unit. The increase in pre-tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expenses, which on a currency-neutral basis, increased 4 percentage points versus fiscal 2006. The lower gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was attributable to an increase in warehousing costs and lower in-line net pricing margins, primarily in footwear, 31 Table of Contents attributable to sales discounts, higher product costs and a shift in product mix to lower priced models. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase in operating overhead, most notably normal wage inflation and growth in the emerging markets, combined with a slight increase in demand creation. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2006. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all three product business units grew. Excluding currency changes, the increase in footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales partially offset by declines in the average selling price per pair. The increased unit sales were driven by increased demand for sport culture products. The declines in the average selling price per pair were due in part to changes in the mix of in-line products sold towards products with a lower average selling price and higher sales incentives as a result of a difficult retail environment in Western Europe. The increase in EMEA apparel revenue was driven by increased unit sales and average selling prices of NIKE branded apparel, primarily increased unit sales of sport performance products, including soccer products driven by the World Cup, and increased average selling prices across most apparel categories. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, sales increases in the emerging markets of our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit led the revenue growth, while sales increases in Western and Northern Europe also contributed to the EMEA sales growth for fiscal 2006. The increase in pre-tax income for the EMEA Region for fiscal 2006 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable foreign currency translation versus fiscal 2005. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in-line net pricing margins in footwear and apparel, partially offset by improved year-over-year hedge rates. The lower in-line net pricing margins for footwear were due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices, higher sales incentives, strategies to improve consumer value, and a shift in the mix of products sold towards products with lower margins. The reduced in-line net pricing margins for apparel were primarily due to higher product costs and higher sales incentives. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than in fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. Excluding currency changes, the increase in selling and administrative costs was driven by higher demand creation expenses partially offset by slightly lower operating overhead expenses. The higher demand creation expenses were primarily due to spending related to the World Cup campaign and increased spending on retail marketing programs. The slightly lower operating overhead expenses were due to lower spending on travel and meeting expenses, lower bad debt expense and slightly lower personnel costs related to our wholesale business, partially offset by increased spending to support the growth of NIKE-owned retail stores. Asia Pacific Region Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,159.2 $ 1,044.1 11 % $ 962.9 8 % Apparel 909.3 815.6 11 % 755.5 8 % Equipment 214.9 194.1 11 % 178.9 8 % Total Revenues $ 2,283.4 $ 2,053.8 11 % $ 1,897.3 8 % Pre-tax Income $ 483.7 $ 412.5 17 % $ 399.8 3 % 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007. While the majority of countries within the region reported double-digit sales increases for the year, China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region, as revenues increased nearly 26% on a currency-neutral basis. The revenue growth in China is primarily due to expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE product, as well as sales through existing doors. Constant-currency revenues in Japan increased only slightly during fiscal 2007. Despite sustained softness in the Japan market, we are starting to see positive signs, including higher gross margins, improvements in sell through at retail and improving futures conversion trends. The growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2007 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China and Korea, partially offset by lower average selling prices, which resulted primarily from strategies to improve consumer value in Japan and Korea, combined with a change in the mix of products sold across the region. The year-over-year increase in apparel revenue was also driven by increased demand in China and Korea. The increase in pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by better inventory management, improved year-over-year hedge rates and reduced warehousing costs. The improvement in margins was partially offset by higher sales incentives, most notably in Japan, combined with efforts to improve consumer value in Japan and Korea. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was attributable to increased investments in demand creation, most notably the Just Do It and Force Basketball campaigns. Overall business growth across the region, combined with retail expansion in China and Korea, also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 1 percentage point for fiscal 2006. Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for each Asia Pacific product business unit were higher than fiscal 2005. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales (driven by increased unit sales across most countries and categories), partially offset by lower average selling prices (due to strategies to improve consumer value in Japan). The increase in apparel revenues was driven by increases across sport performance and sport culture categories. Increased revenue in China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) was the primary growth driver for fiscal 2006, partially offset by lower sales in Japan driven by lower average selling prices due to investments in consumer value and a challenging retail marketplace. The increase in fiscal 2006 pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower in-line net pricing margins due to higher footwear product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices; strategies to improve consumer value for footwear in Japan; and a shift in the mix of footwear and apparel products sold in Japan toward products with lower margins. Selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in demand creation, primarily driven by spending related to the World Cup campaign, and slightly higher operating overhead, primarily due to higher personnel costs to support growth in China. 33 Table of Contents Americas Region Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 679.6 $ 635.3 7 % $ 478.6 33 % Apparel 193.9 201.8 (4 )% 169.1 19 % Equipment 79.0 67.8 17 % 48.1 41 % Total Revenues $ 952.5 $ 904.9 5 % $ 695.8 30 % Pre-tax Income $ 187.4 $ 172.6 9 % $ 116.5 48 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, growth in most markets within the region, led by constant-currency revenue growth of 29% in Argentina, more than offset softer results in Brazil. While currency-neutral footwear and equipment revenues increased 6% and 15%, respectively, versus the prior year, apparel revenues decreased 4% as a result of tough World Cup comparisons. We expect to return to apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2008 as a result of moving from a licensed to a wholesale apparel distribution model in Brazil. The increase in pre-tax income for fiscal 2007 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin improvement was driven by higher in-line net pricing margins resulting from fewer discounts being offered in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, combined with a change in product mix. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to investments in demand creation, most notably the Run Americas II and women’s fitness campaigns, the World Cup and retail resources. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In the Americas Region, 11 percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal 2006 were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Even excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2006. The revenue growth was driven by increased sales in every country in the region, with significant sales increases in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The increase in fiscal 2006 pre-tax income for the Americas Region was attributable to higher revenues, an improved gross margin percentage, lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues and favorable currency translation. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2006. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in both demand creation (due to increased sports marketing endorsement contracts, and increased advertising spending and retail marketing programs primarily related to the World Cup campaign) and operating overhead (driven by increased personnel costs as a result of continued expansion of the business across the region). 34 Table of Contents Other Businesses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues $ 2,259.6 $ 1,947.1 16 % $ 1,735.7 12 % Pre-tax Income $ 303.7 $ 153.6 98 % $ 154.8 (1 )% Converse arbitration (14.2 ) 51.9 — — Pre-tax Income, excluding the Converse arbitration $ 289.5 $ 205.5 41 % $ 154.8 33 % We are providing pre-tax income excluding the Converse arbitration to enhance the visibility of the underlying earnings trend excluding these non-recurring amounts. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The increase in Other business revenues for fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by double-digit revenue growth across nearly all businesses, led by Converse and NIKE Golf. In fiscal 2007, revenues at Converse increased more than 20% versus the prior year to over $550 million, driven by strong consumer demand in the United States and internationally, while NIKE Golf grew 12% to nearly $650 million. During fiscal 2007, improved profitability at Converse, driven by increased wholesale revenues in the United States and growth in our international licensing business, combined with growth at NIKE Golf, contributed to the increase in pre-tax income versus fiscal 2006. As previously discussed, fiscal 2007 results include the benefit of the $14.2 million settlement of the arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South American licensee, as discussed below. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenue increases for our Other businesses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 were driven primarily by growth at Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Pre-tax income from the Other businesses for fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005 and included a $51.9 million charge related to the unfavorable arbitration ruling involving a licensing agreement contract dispute with our Converse subsidiary and a former South American licensee. This charge reduced reported pre-tax income for the Other businesses by 33 percentage points. Excluding the Converse arbitration charge, the pre-tax income improvement was driven by improved profitability at Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf, partially offset by a loss at NIKE Bauer Hockey. The loss at NIKE Bauer Hockey was largely the result of costs incurred in connection with a re-branding initiative. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2007 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.9 billion in fiscal 2007, compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006. Our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of $1.5 billion, and non-cash depreciation and stock-based compensation, offset by investments in working capital and other assets and liabilities to support growth in the business. The increase in working capital during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the timing of payments, while the increase in inventories reflects year-over-year growth in reported futures and higher inventories to support the expansion of NIKE-owned retail stores, slightly offset by better inventory management. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year. 35 Table of Contents Cash provided by investing activities was $0.1 billion during fiscal 2007, compared to $1.3 billion used in investing activities during fiscal 2006. The year-over-year change was due to a net decrease of $382.4 million in short-term investments during fiscal 2007, compared to a net increase of $909.9 million in short-term investments during fiscal 2006. The decrease in short-term investments was the result of a strategic shift to highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less. Cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal 2007, compared to $0.9 billion used in fiscal 2006. The increase versus fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the $250 million repayment of corporate bonds, combined with an increase in share repurchases, discussed below, partially offset by an increase in notes payable, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2007, we purchased approximately 22.1 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $975.3 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, 4.0 million of the shares repurchased completed the previous four-year, $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2004. As of the end of fiscal 2007, we have repurchased 18.1 million shares for $812.7 million under the new $3 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in June 2006. We expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2007 were $0.71, compared to $0.59 in fiscal 2006. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. Our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20% to 30% of the trailing twelve-months’ earnings per share, paid out on a quarterly basis. We review our dividend policy from time to time, and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements, we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2007, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 260.9 $ 219.9 $ 183.3 $ 156.7 $ 128.4 $ 587.0 $ 1,536.2 Long-term Debt 30.5 5.5 30.5 5.5 133.0 236.5 441.5 Endorsement Contracts(1) 541.0 483.2 398.7 310.5 268.6 792.1 2,794.1 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 2,063.4 0.3 — — — — 2,063.7 Other(3),(4) 269.8 51.3 10.7 3.2 1.1 0.9 337.0 Total $ 3,165.6 $ 760.2 $ 623.2 $ 475.9 $ 531.1 $ 1,616.5 $ 7,172.5 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for 36 Table of Contents bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2007. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2007. (4) Included in Other is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services for fiscal 2008 and part of fiscal 2009. The amount of future payments depends on our level of monthly usage of the different elements of the contractor’s services. If we were to terminate the entire contract as of May 31, 2007, we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of $16.3 million. Our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate $5.3 million. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2007. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as of May 31, 2007 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 100.8 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 44.6 As of May 31, 2007, letters of credit of $165.9 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which $1 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium-term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500 million in medium-term notes, as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the medium-term note program we have issued $240.0 million in medium-term notes. 37 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, no medium-term notes were issued under the program. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2008 depending on general corporate needs. During fiscal 2007, one of the Company’s Japanese subsidiaries entered into a 3.0 billion yen (approximately $24.7 million as of May 31, 2007) loan facility that replaced certain intercompany borrowings. The interest rate on the facility is based on the six-month Japanese Yen London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, resulting in an all-in rate of 0.805% at May 31, 2007. The facility expires on December 31, 2007 unless both parties agree to an extension. During fiscal 2007, the Company’s same Japanese subsidiary entered into a 5.0 billion yen (approximately $41.1 million as of May 31, 2007) term loan that replaces certain intercompany borrowings and matures on February 14, 2012. The interest rate on the loan is approximately 1.5% and interest is paid semi-annually. As of May 31, 2007, we had a multi-year $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks, and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility. The facility matures in December 2011, and can be extended for one additional year on both the first and second anniversary date. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A2 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, and set a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2007, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2007 or May 31, 2006. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 06-3, “How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)” (“EITF 06-3”). EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of the method of accounting for the applicable assessed taxes and the amount of assessed taxes that are included in revenues if they are accounted for under the gross method. EITF 06-3 was adopted in the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2007; however, since we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, no additional disclosures were required. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (“FAS 158”). FAS 158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements. We adopted the provisions of FAS 158 in the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2007. See Note 38 Table of Contents 12— Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of FAS 158. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 requires public companies to quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement as material, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered. The adoption of SAB 108 at May 31, 2007 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. We have evaluated the provisions of FIN 48 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF Issue No. 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43” (“EITF 06-2”). EITF 06-2 clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees’ rights to compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement. The provisions of EITF 06-2 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007 and will be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. We have evaluated the provisions of EITF 06-2 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“FAS 159”). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The provisions of FAS 159 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 159. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since 39 Table of Contents our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. 40 Table of Contents Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded within other (income) expense, net. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors, including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units. Our estimates 41 Table of Contents may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. Any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite-lived intangible assets would be classified within other (income) expense, net. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any significant impairment charges would be classified within other (income) expense, net. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted (“FAS 133”), have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes significantly, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. Stock-based Compensation As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Under the provisions of FAS 123R, the fair value of stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. 42 Table of Contents In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Therefore, actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. 43 Table of Contents We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months, although at May 31, 2007 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our European subsidiary. We use forward contracts to hedge non-functional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, Korean won, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of medium and long-term fixed rate debt, commercial paper, and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $13.7 million and $17.5 million at May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively. The decrease in VaR as of May 31, 2007 occurred due to a lower notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of May 31, 2007 compared to May 31, 2006. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being 44 Table of Contents hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $36.5 million and $34.9 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Details of other market-sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below, except the interest rate swaps which are described below. These instruments include intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

Intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties, as discussed above. The fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary. There were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal 2007. We did not issue any long-term fixed-rate corporate bonds during fiscal 2007 or 2006; however, in previous years we issued a total of $240 million in long-term fixed-rate corporate bonds that mature between July 2007 and October 2015. Fixed interest 45 Table of Contents rates on these bonds range from 4.7% to 5.66%. For each of the bonds issued, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three-month or six-month LIBOR plus a spread. As a result of the interest rate swap agreements, the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 5.38% at May 31, 2007 and 6.07% at May 31, 2006. For $190 million of the issued bonds, the associated swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt. The remaining $50 million bond matures in October 2013, whereas the associated interest rate swap expired in October 2006. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this swap were recorded in net income each period. The recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net loss of $2.6 million and $5.6 million at May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively, and a $9.0 million gain at May 31, 2005. The change in fair value of the $50 million interest rate swap that expired in October 2006 was not material for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.8% and receives variable interest payments based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8.0 billion Japanese yen. This interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period. The change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.",2023-12-30 18:03:12.676651
320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE-owned retail, including stores and e-commerce, and independent distributors, franchisees and licensees in the United States and worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to create long-term revenue growth by creating compelling consumer experiences by creating and delivering innovative, “must have” products; deep personal connections with our brands; and compelling retail presentation. We strive to convert revenue growth to shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas: • Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline • Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste • Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs • Improving working capital efficiency • Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders By executing this strategy, we aim to deliver the following long-term financial goals: • High single-digit revenue growth; • Mid-teens earnings per share growth; 21 Table of Contents • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows; and • Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. In fiscal 2008 we met or exceeded these financial goals. Our revenues grew 14% to $18.6 billion, net income grew 26% to $1.9 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.74, a 28% increase versus fiscal 2007. These reported results included combined gains from the sale of our Starter Brand and NIKE Bauer Hockey businesses of $35.4 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2008 and the gain recognized on the sale-leaseback of the Oregon Footwear Distribution Center of $10.0 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007, one-time tax benefits of $105.4 million and $25.5 million recognized in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, operational losses of $13.3 million, net of tax, from Umbro, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and a $9.6 million gain, net of tax, from the Converse arbitration ruling settlement in fiscal 2007. We estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency losses included in other (expense) income, net resulted in a year-over-year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 6%. For the year, the increase in net income was higher than our rate of revenue growth due to a reduction in our effective tax rate and improved gross margins, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. Fiscal 2008 results were positively affected by a reduction in our effective tax rate of 7.4 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of the $105.4 million one-time tax benefit received in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Also reflected in the year-over-year effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our ongoing effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside of the United States; our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Gross margins for the year grew 110 basis points versus the prior year as inventory management and strategic price increases were partially offset by higher product costs and increased close-out sales. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to higher investments in growth drivers such as athlete and sport team endorsers of our products, spending around major sporting events, key product initiatives, investments in company owned retail and non-NIKE brand businesses as well as normal wage increases. Our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program. In addition, we increased cash flow from operations and continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased cash paid for share repurchases. Our return on invested capital increased as compared to fiscal 2007. Although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, we continue to believe these are appropriate long-term goals.

Strong demand for NIKE brand products continued to drive revenue growth, as all four of our geographic regions and, on a consolidated basis, all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth. The U.S. Region contributed nearly 2 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, our international regions contributed nearly 7 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. Our Other businesses, comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley International, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf, and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008) contributed the remaining consolidated constant-currency revenue growth, as Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf posted higher year-over-year revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE brand footwear revenue grew 14% and contributed more than $1.2 billion of incremental revenue for fiscal 2008. Our worldwide NIKE branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 14% and 10% for the year, respectively, and combined added approximately $750 million of incremental revenue. Our Other Businesses reported revenue growth of 15% and combined added more than $330 million of incremental revenue. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth. All four of our geographic regions and, on a consolidated basis, all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, both the U.S. Region and our international regions each contributed more than 2.5 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2007. Sales in our Other businesses contributed the remaining 2 percentage points of the consolidated constant-currency revenue growth, as each business within the group posted higher revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE brand footwear revenue grew 7% and contributed nearly $550 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2007. Our worldwide NIKE branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 10% and 12% for the year, respectively, and combined added more than $500 million of incremental revenue.

The factors driving an increased gross margin percentage were partially offset by lower apparel in-line gross pricing margins primarily driven by higher product costs, most notably in the U.S. and EMEA Regions, and increased apparel close-out sales, primarily in the U.S. Region. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decrease in the consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows: (1) Lower footwear close-out net pricing margins in the U.S. and EMEA Regions, primarily due to sales discounts, combined with a higher close-out mix; partially offset by (2) Improved hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the EMEA and Asia Pacific Regions; (3) Better inventory management, most notably in our Asia Pacific Region; and (4) Improved gross margins in our Other businesses, driven primarily by the growth in Converse’s international licensing business, partially offset by the expected effects of the transition in Exeter’s business from a licensing model to a wholesale model.

We adopted FAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective transition method. This expense was not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal 2006. (See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) (2) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. 24 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 120 basis points, driven primarily by strategic investments in both demand creation and operating overhead. Changes in currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense growth by four percentage points. On a constant-currency basis, demand creation expense increased 15% versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to investments in athlete and sport team endorsers of our products, spending around major sporting events including the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the European Football Championships, key product initiatives such as Men’s Training in the U.S. and retail presentation. Excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 14% versus the prior year. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE-owned retail, non-NIKE brand businesses, emerging markets and normal wage inflation and performance compensation. We believe total selling and administrative expenses will grow faster than our rate of revenue growth in fiscal 2009 driven primarily by strategic investments in demand creation, including spending around the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the European Football Championships and increased investments in athlete and team endorsers of our products. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 90 basis points; however, excluding the $141.9 million pre-tax charge relating to the change in accounting for stock-based compensation, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was consistent with the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, demand creation expense increased 7% versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to investments in the NIKE Air®, NIKE+, NIKE Pro, and Force Basketball campaigns. For fiscal year 2007, constant-currency growth in demand creation expense was consistent with our constant-currency revenue growth. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and the effects of changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 7%, which was in line with our constant-currency revenue growth. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE-owned retail and non-NIKE brands, as well as normal wage inflation and performance based compensation. Other (Expense) Income, net Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Other (expense) income, net $ (7.9 ) $ 0.9 978 % $ (4.4 ) 120 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Other (expense) income, net is comprised substantially of gains and losses from hedging and re-measurement of non-functional currency balances, disposals of fixed assets, as well as other unusual or non-recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. Foreign currency hedge gains and losses reported in other (expense) income, net are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information). In fiscal 2008, other (expense) income, net included foreign currency hedge losses that were partially offset by the $32.0 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and the $28.6 million gain on the sale of the Starter 25 Table of Contents brand business. Other (expense) income, net in fiscal 2007 is primarily comprised of the $14.7 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our Oregon footwear distribution center and the $14.2 million benefit from the settlement of the Converse arbitration, partially offset by foreign currency hedge losses. In fiscal 2008, we estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency losses included in other (expense) income, net resulted in a year-over-year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $122 million. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 For fiscal 2007, other (expense) income, net was primarily comprised of the $14.7 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our Oregon footwear distribution center and the $14.2 million benefit from the settlement of the Converse arbitration, offset by foreign currency hedge losses. The foreign currency hedge losses recognized in fiscal 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the Euro since we entered into these hedge contracts. The change in other (expense) income, net versus the prior year period was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal 2007, which were more than offset by the Converse arbitration settlement and gain on the sale of our Oregon footwear distribution center discussed above, compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006, which were more than offset by the $51.9 million charge taken during the fourth quarter as a result of the Converse arbitration. The gain on the sale of the Oregon footwear distribution center is reflected in the U.S. Region line and the Converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the Other line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information). In fiscal 2007, the net foreign currency hedge losses discussed above were partially offset by favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most notably in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other (expense) income, net, and the favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits did not have a significant impact on consolidated income before income taxes for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. Income Taxes Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06Change Effective tax rate 24.8 % 32.2 % (740) bps 35.0 % (280) bps Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 24.8%, 7.4 percentage points lower than the prior year. Over the last few years, several of our international entities generated losses for which we did not recognize the corresponding tax benefits, as the realization of those benefits was uncertain. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we took steps necessary to realize these benefits, resulting in a one-time tax benefit of $105.4 million. Also reflected in the year-over-year effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our on-going effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside the United States; our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits from our operations outside the United States; our tax rate on these operations is generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. These benefits included the 10-year European tax agreement finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, which is effective for fiscal years 2006 through 2015. This agreement, which provided a retroactive tax benefit for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007, favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007. 26 Table of Contents Futures Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2008 were more than 11% higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2007. This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. The net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 3 percentage points to this reported futures growth versus the same period in the prior year. Excluding this currency impact, unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, Umbro, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands.

These changes had no impact on previously reported results of operations or shareholders’ equity. The following discussion includes disclosure of pre-tax income for our operating segments. We have reported pre-tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” As discussed in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre-tax income of our operating segments. U.S. Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 4,326.8 $ 4,067.2 6 % $ 3,832.2 6 % Apparel 1,745.1 1,716.1 2 % 1,591.6 8 % Equipment 306.1 323.8 (5 )% 298.7 8 % Total Revenues $ 6,378.0 $ 6,107.1 4 % $ 5,722.5 7 % Pre-tax Income $ 1,391.9 $ 1,367.3 2 % $ 1,315.2 4 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was the result of low-single digit growth in unit sales and a slight increase in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales and average selling price per pair was driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sportswear products and Brand Jordan products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our NIKE brand basketball products. The increase in average selling price per pair was also attributable to strategic price increases and an increased sales mix of higher priced NIKE brand sportswear and Brand Jordan products. The year-over-year increase in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2008 reflected an increase in unit sales, mostly offset by lower average selling prices. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by higher close-out sales and increased demand for NIKE brand sports performance products, partially offset by lower unit sales of sportswear and Brand Jordan products. Average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of a higher mix of close-out sales. The year-over-year decrease in U.S. equipment revenues during fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit sales of accessory products and fewer close-out sales. 28 Table of Contents Pre-tax income for the U.S. Region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2008 as a result of higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses, partially offset by higher gross margins, driven by footwear. The increase in demand creation was driven by higher sports marketing expenses and investments in the retail presentation of our key wholesale customers. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE-owned retail and normal wage inflation. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was attributable to high single-digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sportswear products; kids’ product, including boys and girls sportswear; Brand Jordan products; and men’s running products, due to the growth of our Nike+ performance models. The decrease in average selling price per pair compared to the prior year was the result of a higher mix of off-price products, combined with growth in lower priced kids’ product. The year-over-year increase in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2007 reflected mid single-digit growth in unit sales combined with a low single-digit increase in average price per unit. The increase in unit sales versus the prior year was driven by double-digit growth in NIKE brand sport performance apparel, while the improvement in average selling prices was driven by team and licensed apparel and Brand Jordan products. Pre-tax income for the U.S. Region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2007 as a result of lower gross margins. The gross margin decline was primarily attributable to a higher level of close-out sales and sales discounts compared to the prior year, most notably in our footwear business. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2006, but represented a lower percentage of revenue due to operating overhead leverage. EMEA Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 3,112.6 $ 2,608.0 19 % $ 2,454.3 6 % Apparel 2,083.5 1,757.2 19 % 1,559.0 13 % Equipment 424.3 358.1 18 % 313.3 14 % Total Revenues $ 5,620.4 $ 4,723.3 19 % $ 4,326.6 9 % Pre-tax Income $ 1,266.2 $ 1,036.2 22 % $ 992.6 4 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 11 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2008. Nearly all markets within the region increased revenues during the year. The emerging markets in the region grew nearly 25%, driven by strong results in Russia, Turkey and South Africa. Increases in Northern Europe and the U.K. also contributed significantly to the revenue growth. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to double-digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our NIKE brand soccer and sportswear products. The decrease in average selling price per pair resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product models, most notably within our NIKE brand sportswear product lines. 29 Table of Contents On a currency neutral basis, EMEA apparel revenue increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased unit sales and a slight increase in average selling prices. The increase in unit sales was driven primarily by increased demand for sports performance products, most notably soccer. The increase in pre-tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues, favorable foreign currency translation and a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to improved year-over-year hedge rates and improved margins on close-out product. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by an increase in demand creation spending, primarily attributable to spending around the European Football Championships. As a result of retail expansion and overall business growth across the region, operating overhead expenses increased for the year, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2007. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all markets within the region except the U.K. and France increased revenues during the year. The emerging markets in the region grew over 30%, driven by strong results in Greece, Russia, Turkey and South Africa. Increases in Northern Europe, Italy and Spain also contributed significantly to the revenue growth. After experiencing challenging retail conditions in the U.K. and France during fiscal 2007, we have started to see signs of improvement in these markets, including year-over-year futures growth. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 1 percentage point during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to low single-digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture products, most notably “metro” and outdoor products. The growth in unit sales more than offset a decline in the average selling price per pair, which resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product styles, combined with an increase in close-out sales. Excluding changes in exchange rates, apparel revenues increased 7 percentage points during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected high single-digit growth in unit sales, driven by both sports culture and sports performance products, combined with a low single-digit increase in average price per unit. The increase in pre-tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expenses, which on a currency-neutral basis, increased 4 percentage points versus fiscal 2006. The lower gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was attributable to an increase in warehousing costs and lower in-line net pricing margins, primarily in footwear, attributable to sales discounts, higher product costs and a shift in product mix to lower priced models. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase in operating overhead, most notably normal wage inflation and growth in the emerging markets, combined with a slight increase in demand creation. 30 Table of Contents Asia Pacific Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,499.5 $ 1,159.2 29 % $ 1,044.1 11 % Apparel 1,140.0 909.3 25 % 815.6 11 % Equipment 242.2 214.9 13 % 194.1 11 % Total Revenues $ 2,881.7 $ 2,283.4 26 % $ 2,053.8 11 % Pre-tax Income $ 692.6 $ 508.3 36 % $ 436.4 16 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Nearly all countries across the region delivered revenue growth on a currency neutral basis. China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2008 revenues increased 50% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by the expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE product and sales through existing stores. Constant-currency revenues in Japan increased at a low single digit rate during fiscal 2008. Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2008 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China, partially offset by lower average selling prices driven primarily by a shift in mix from higher priced to lower priced models. The year-over-year increase in apparel revenue was driven by increased demand in China. The increase in pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2008 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by reduced warehousing costs, improved year-over-year currency hedge rates and improved margins on close-out product. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to spending around the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Overall business growth across the region combined with retail expansion, primarily in China, also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses, which grew slightly slower than revenues. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007. While the majority of countries within the region reported double-digit sales increases for the year, China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region, as revenues increased nearly 26% on a currency-neutral basis. The revenue growth in China is primarily due to expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE product, as well as sales through existing doors. Constant-currency revenues in Japan increased only slightly during fiscal 2007. Despite sustained softness in the Japan market, we are starting to see positive signs, including higher gross margins, improvements in sell through at retail and improving futures conversion trends. The growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2007 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China and Korea, partially offset by lower average selling prices, which resulted primarily from strategies to improve consumer value in Japan and Korea, combined with a change in the mix of products sold across the region. The year-over-year increase in apparel revenue was also driven by increased demand in China and Korea. The increase in pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset higher selling and 31 Table of Contents administrative expenses. The gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by better inventory management, improved year-over-year hedge rates and reduced warehousing costs. The improvement in margins was partially offset by higher sales incentives, most notably in Japan, combined with efforts to improve consumer value in Japan and Korea. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was attributable to increased investments in demand creation, most notably the Just Do It and Force Basketball campaigns. Overall business growth across the region, combined with retail expansion in China and Korea, also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses. Americas Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 792.7 $ 679.6 17 % $ 635.3 7 % Apparel 265.4 193.9 37 % 201.8 (4 )% Equipment 96.0 79.0 22 % 67.8 17 % Total Revenues $ 1,154.1 $ 952.5 21 % $ 904.9 5 % Pre-tax Income $ 239.3 $ 192.7 24 % $ 177.6 9 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 7 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Americas Region reported growth in all markets, led by Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. The increase in pre-tax income for fiscal 2008 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues, improved gross margins and operating overhead leverage, combined with favorable foreign currency translation. These factors were partially offset by higher demand creation spending as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement was driven primarily by higher in-line net pricing margins resulting from a better mix of products sold and fewer discounts offered in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in demand creation spending during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to investments in sports marketing, most notably in soccer, brand events including spending around Run Americas III and investments in the retail presentation of NIKE + and NIKE Pro products. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, growth in most markets within the region, led by constant-currency revenue growth of 29% in Argentina, more than offset softer results in Brazil. While currency-neutral footwear and equipment revenues increased 6% and 15%, respectively, versus the prior year, apparel revenues decreased 4% as a result of tough World Cup comparisons. We expect to return to apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2008 as a result of moving from a licensed to a wholesale apparel distribution model in Brazil. The increase in pre-tax income for fiscal 2007 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin improvement was driven by higher in-line net pricing margins resulting from fewer discounts being offered in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, combined with a change in product mix. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to investments in demand creation, most notably the Run Americas II and women’s fitness campaigns, the World Cup and retail resources. 32 Table of Contents Other Businesses Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues $ 2,592.8 $ 2,259.6 15 % $ 1,947.1 16 % Pre-tax Income $ 336.4 $ 299.7 12 % $ 153.6 95 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in Other business revenues was driven by higher revenues across all businesses, most notably Converse and NIKE Golf. In fiscal 2008, revenues at Converse increased more than 29% versus the prior year to approximately $729 million, driven by strong consumer demand in the United States and internationally, while NIKE Golf grew 12% to nearly $725 million. Revenues at Cole Haan increased 6% to $496 million, driven by strong results at company-owned retail stores. Revenues at Hurley increased 14% to $171 million. During fiscal 2008, growth at Converse and NIKE Golf, combined with margin improvements across most businesses drove the year-over-year increase in pre-tax income. Fiscal 2007 pre-tax income included a $14.2 million benefit relating to the settlement of an arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South American licensee. Fiscal 2008 pre-tax income for our Other businesses would have increased approximately 18% versus fiscal 2007 excluding this favorable settlement. As part of our long term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses as well as new business opportunities to ensure the Company is investing in those businesses with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On March 3, 2008 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Umbro Plc (“Umbro”), a leading United Kingdom-based global soccer brand, for a purchase price of £290.5 million in cash (approximately $576.4 million), inclusive of direct transaction costs. This acquisition is intended to significantly strengthen our market position in the United Kingdom and expand NIKE’s global leadership in soccer, a key area of growth for the Company. This acquisition also provides scaled positions in emerging soccer markets such as China, Russia and Brazil. The results of Umbro’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and in the Other operating segment since the date of acquisition. Umbro, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange prior to our acquisition, reported in their 2006 annual report that revenues for calendar year 2006 were approximately $276 million (£149.5 million), and estimated that the combination of Umbro’s calendar year 2006 wholesale revenue and estimated sales revenue earned by Umbro’s licensees from the sale of Umbro products totaled approximately $755 million (£409.4 million). Following a strategic review of the Company’s existing business portfolio, we concluded that the Starter and Bauer Hockey businesses did not align with our long-term growth priorities. On December 17, 2007 we completed the sale of the Starter brand business for $60 million in cash. On April 17, 2008 we completed the sale of the Bauer Hockey business for net proceeds of $189.2 million after working capital adjustments. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $28.6 million and $32.0 million, respectively, which are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 — Operating Segments). Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The increase in Other business revenues for fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by double-digit revenue growth across nearly all businesses, led by Converse and NIKE Golf. In fiscal 2007, revenues at Converse increased more than 20% versus the prior year to over $550 million, driven by strong consumer demand in the United States and internationally, while NIKE Golf grew 12% to nearly $650 million. 33 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, improved profitability at Converse, driven by increased wholesale revenues in the United States and growth in our international licensing business, combined with growth at NIKE Golf, contributed to the increase in pre-tax income versus fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 results also include the benefit of the $14.2 million settlement of the arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South American licensee. This dispute was settled during the first quarter ended August 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2008 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was approximately $1.9 billion in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Our primary source of operating cash flow in fiscal 2008 was net income of $1.9 billion. Adjustments for non-cash depreciation and stock-based compensation were offset by increases in deferred income taxes as well as investments in working capital and other assets and liabilities to support growth in the business. The increase in working capital during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in inventories and accounts receivable, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable is attributable to higher sales in the last quarter of 2008. The increase in inventories reflects year-over-year growth in reported futures and higher inventories to support the expansion of NIKE-owned retail stores, slightly offset by better inventory management. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year. Cash used by investing activities was $0.4 billion during fiscal 2008, compared to $0.1 billion provided by investing activities during fiscal 2007. The year-over-year increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to our acquisition of Umbro for approximately $0.6 billion offset by proceeds from the divestitures of our NIKE Bauer Hockey and Starter brand businesses of $0.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities was $1.2 billion during fiscal 2008, compared to $1.1 billion used in fiscal 2007. The increase versus fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, discussed below, partially offset by a decrease in payments of long term debt as we made a $250 million repayment of corporate bonds in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 20.6 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $1.2 billion. As of the end of fiscal 2008, we have repurchased 38.6 million shares for $2.1 billion under the $3 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in June 2006. We expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash and/or debt. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2008 were $0.875, compared to $0.71 in fiscal 2007. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. Our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20% to 30% of the trailing twelve-months’ earnings per share, paid out on a quarterly basis. We review our dividend policy from time to time, and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements, we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2008, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 312.4 $ 264.4 $ 228.9 $ 192.1 $ 163.9 $ 692.3 $ 1,854.0 Long-term Debt 6.3 31.3 6.3 153.4 46.3 197.5 441.1 Endorsement Contracts(1) 700.4 599.3 518.3 480.3 407.2 1,122.0 3,827.5 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 2,272.0 1.9 — — — — 2,273.9 Other(3) 250.7 76.4 62.6 55.1 50.7 1.2 496.7 Total $ 3,541.8 $ 973.3 $ 816.1 $ 880.9 $ 668.1 $ 2,013.0 $ 8,893.2 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2008. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2008. The total long-term liability for uncertain tax positions was $251.1 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2008. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. 35 Table of Contents We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2008. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2008 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 177.7 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 65.9 As of May 31, 2008, letters of credit of $193.4 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which $1 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium-term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500.0 million in medium-term notes as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the program have issued $240.0 million in medium-term notes. As of May 31, 2008, $215.0 million in medium-term notes remained outstanding. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2009 depending on general corporate needs. During fiscal 2008, one of our Japanese subsidiaries entered into a total of ¥5.0 billion (approximately $47.4 million as of May 31, 2008) in short-term loans to meet general operating needs. The interest rates on the loans are based on the prevailing Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate of our election plus a spread, resulting in a weighted average all-in rate of 1.06% at May 31, 2008. During fiscal 2007, another of our Japanese subsidiaries entered into a ¥3.0 billion (approximately $28.5 million as of May 31, 2008) loan facility that replaced certain intercompany borrowings. The interest rate on the facility is based on the six-month Japanese Yen London Interbank Offer Rate (“JPY LIBOR”) plus a spread resulting in an all in rate of approximately 1.12% at May 31, 2008. This loan facility was renewed during fiscal 2008. Subsequent to May 31, 2008, this loan facility expired and was replaced with intercompany borrowings. During fiscal 2007, the same Japanese subsidiary entered into a ¥5.0 billion (approximately $47.4 million as of May 31, 2008) term loan that replaced certain intercompany borrowings and matures on February 14, 2012. The interest rate on the loan is approximately 1.5% and interest is paid semi-annually. As of May 31, 2008, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi-year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012 and can be extended for one additional year on its next anniversary date. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the 36 Table of Contents event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2008, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2008 or May 31, 2007. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on June 1, 2007. See Note 8 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43” (“EITF 06-2”). EITF 06-2 clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees’ rights to compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement. The adoption of EITF 06-2 on June 1, 2007 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008 and the provisions of FAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities except for items recognized at fair value on a recurring basis are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities. We have evaluated the provisions of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“FAS 159”). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The provisions of FAS 159 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. We have evaluated the provisions of FAS 159 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141(R)”) and SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“FAS 160”). These standards aim to improve, simplify, and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The provisions of FAS 141(R) and FAS 160 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 141(R) and FAS 160. 37 Table of Contents In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 161”). FAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The provisions of FAS 161 are effective for the quarter ending February 28, 2009. We do not expect that the adoption of FAS 161 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. 38 Table of Contents Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result 39 Table of Contents in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded within other (expense) income, net. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, and changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset tests require the use of discounted cash flow valuation models. Those models require estimates of future revenue, profits, expenditures and working capital. These estimates are determined by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. Our estimates may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. Any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite-lived intangible assets would be classified within other (expense) income, net. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any significant impairment charges would be classified within other (expense) income, net. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted (“FAS 133”), have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes beyond the threshold allowed by FAS 133, we are 40 Table of Contents required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (expense) income, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When appropriately designated as a hedge in accordance with FAS 133, the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. In accordance with FAS 133, we consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock-based Compensation As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Under the provisions of FAS 123R, the fair value of stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists 41 Table of Contents that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FIN 48. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (expense) income, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. 42 Table of Contents When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve to eighteen months, although at May 31, 2008 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 34 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by one of our European subsidiaries. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros, British pounds, and Japanese yen. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $34.9 million and $13.7 million at May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, respectively. The increase in VaR as of May 31, 2008 occurred due to a higher notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments coupled with increased foreign currency volatility as of May 31, 2008 compared to May 31, 2007. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $32.3 million and $36.5 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Details of other market-sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2008.

Intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties, as discussed above. The fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly re-measurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary. 44 Table of Contents In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.80% and receives variable interest payments based on 3-month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8.0 billion Japanese yen. This interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period. The change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended May 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.",2023-12-30 18:03:13.084182
320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE-owned retail, including stores and e-commerce, independent distributors, franchisees and licensees worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products; building deep personal consumer connections with our brands; and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences. We strive to convert revenue growth to shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas: • Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline • Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste • Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs • Improving working capital efficiency • Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goal is to achieve: • High single-digit revenue growth • Mid-teens earnings per share growth • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and • Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 22 Table of Contents Since the adoption of this long-term strategy in 2001, on an annual compounded basis, NIKE, Inc.’s revenues and earnings per share have grown 9% and 14%, respectively. During the same period, our return on invested capital increased from 14% to 18%. In fiscal 2009, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions caused significant volatility in global financial markets and put significant pressure on discretionary consumer spending worldwide. NIKE’s fiscal 2009 revenues grew 3% to $19.2 billion, net income decreased 21% to $1.5 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.03, a 19% decrease versus fiscal 2008. Our fiscal 2009 reported results also contain significant non-comparable transactions, including after-tax charges of $144.5 million for our restructuring activities, which were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and $240.7 million for the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Our fiscal 2008 reported results include combined gains from the sale of our Starter Brand and NIKE Bauer Hockey businesses of $35.4 million, net of tax, and a one-time tax benefit of $105.4 million. Excluding these non-comparable items, net income would have increased 7% to $1.9 billion and diluted earnings per share would have increased 10% to $3.81 compared to fiscal 2008 (see Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non-Comparable items below). The increase in our net income excluding non-comparable items was higher than our rate of revenue growth in fiscal 2009 due primarily to an increase in other (income) expense, net, which included foreign currency conversion gains of $43.4 million compared to foreign currency conversion losses of $76.6 million in fiscal 2008, and the recognition of licensing income of $24.0 million related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the NIKE Bauer Hockey business. Excluding non-comparable items, our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program in the first half of fiscal 2009. Our cash flows from operations and return on invested capital both declined as compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, we took steps we believe prudent and necessary to identify and manage potential exposures and to position ourselves for sustainable, profitable long-term growth. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we executed a plan of restructuring the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market, and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million, primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs. As part of this restructuring plan, we also initiated a reorganization of the NIKE brand business into a new operating model consisting of six geographies. As a result of the reorganization, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, our new organizational structure will consist of the following geographies: North America, Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Other steps taken in fiscal 2009 included reductions in planned selling and administrative expenses, including the implementation of a hiring freeze, reductions in planned spending for travel, meetings and demand creation, as well as tighter inventory purchasing and working capital management. We also placed increased focus on monitoring the financial health of suppliers and customers and continued to take proactive measures to consolidate production with our strongest, most efficient and innovative manufacturing contractors to ensure we maintain a healthy production base for the present and the future. These capacity consolidation actions could result in additional costs associated with production and logistics as well as supply chain disruptions in the first half of fiscal year 2010 as we transition production between manufacturing contractors; however, we do not believe these potential additional costs will have a material impact on our operating results. We continue to believe that the Company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective, but we are not immune to the current challenging global economic conditions. These conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways, including lower revenue from slowing consumer/customer demand for our products, reduced profit margins and/or increased costs, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experiences by suppliers and customers. Our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by the evolving macroeconomic conditions and our continued actions to respond to these conditions. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions, except per share data) Revenues $ 19,176.1 $ 18,627.0 3 % $ 16,325.9 14 % Cost of sales 10,571.7 10,239.6 3 % 9,165.4 12 % Gross margin 8,604.4 8,387.4 3 % 7,160.5 17 % Gross margin % 44.9 % 45.0 % 43.9 % Selling and administrative expense 6,149.6 5,953.7 3 % 5,028.7 18 % % of Revenues 32.1 % 32.0 % 30.8 % Restructuring charges 195.0 — — — — Goodwill impairment 199.3 — — — — Intangible and other asset impairment 202.0 — — — — Income before income taxes 1,956.5 2,502.9 -22 % 2,199.9 14 % Net income 1,486.7 1,883.4 -21 % 1,491.5 26 % Diluted earnings per share 3.03 3.74 -19 % 2.93 28 % Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non-Comparable Items(1) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08Change (In millions, except per share data) Net income, as reported $ 1,486.7 $ 1,883.4 -21 % Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax(2) 144.5 — Umbro impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, net of tax(3) 240.7 — Gain recognized on sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey, net of tax — (17.7 ) Gain recognized on sale of Starter Business, net of tax — (17.7 ) One-time tax benefits(4) — (105.4 ) Net income, excluding non-comparable items $ 1,871.9 $ 1,742.6 7 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 3.03 $ 3.74 -19 % Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax(2) 0.29 — Umbro impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, net of tax(3) 0.49 — Gain recognized on sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey,net of tax — (0.04 ) Gain recognized on sale of Starter Business, net of tax — (0.04 ) One-time tax benefits(4) — (0.21 ) Diluted earnings per share, excluding non-comparable items $ 3.81 $ 3.45 10 % Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 490.7 504.1 ( 1) This schedule is intended to satisfy the quantitative reconciliation for non-GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As a result, we incurred a $195 million pre-tax restructuring charge primarily consisting of severance costs related to the workforce reduction. ( 3) We recorded a non-cash impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 to reduce the carrying value of Umbro’s goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark and other assets. The impairment charge is a result of both the deteriorating global consumer markets, particularly in Umbro’s primary market, the United Kingdom, and management’s decision to adjust planned investment in the brand. In addition, the deterioration of the financial markets has reduced both the present value of future cash flows and the market value of comparable businesses. ( 4) The tax benefit realized during fiscal 2008 relates to steps taken to realize losses generated by several international entities for which we had not previously recognized the offsetting tax benefit because the realization of those benefits had been uncertain. The necessary steps to realize those tax benefits were taken during fiscal 2008 resulting in a one-time reduction of the effective tax rate. Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues $ 19,176.1 $ 18,627.0 3 % $ 16,325.9 14 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenues by 1 percentage point. The U.S. Region contributed nearly 1 percentage point of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, our international regions contributed over 3 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues on a currency neutral basis. By product group, our worldwide NIKE brand footwear business reported revenue growth of 6% and contributed $575 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2009. Worldwide NIKE branded apparel revenues were in line with the prior year, while equipment revenues declined 2% or $20 million. Our Other businesses, comprised primarily of results from Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, and Umbro in fiscal 2009, constituted the remaining revenue. In fiscal 2008, our Other businesses also included Exeter Brands Group (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007) and NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008). Umbro was acquired on March 3, 2008. Revenues for these businesses declined 1% or $17 million. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 5 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth. Strong demand for NIKE brand products continued to drive revenue growth, as all four of our geographic regions and, on a consolidated basis, all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth. The U.S. Region contributed nearly 2 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, our international regions contributed nearly 7 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. Our Other businesses contributed the remaining consolidated constant-currency revenue growth, as Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf posted higher year-over-year revenues. 25 Table of Contents By product group, worldwide NIKE brand footwear revenue grew 14% and contributed more than $1.2 billion of incremental revenue for fiscal 2008. Worldwide NIKE branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 14% and 6% for the year, respectively, and combined added approximately $750 million of incremental revenue in fiscal 2008. Our Other businesses reported revenue growth of 17% and combined added more than $360 million of incremental revenue. Gross Margin Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 8,604.4 $ 8,387.4 3% $ 7,160.5 17% Gross Margin % 44.9 % 45.0 % (10 bps ) 43.9 % 110 bps Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decline in consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were lower gross pricing margins and increased discounts which, when combined, decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 60 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by improved hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) Region. Gross pricing margins were lower, primarily driven by higher product input costs, most notably for footwear products. Higher levels of discounts were provided across all businesses in fiscal 2009 to manage inventory levels. We anticipate our gross margins in fiscal 2010 will be negatively impacted by hedge rates that are unfavorable in comparison to the prior year. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, the primary factors contributing to the 110 basis point increase in the consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year included: higher footwear in-line gross pricing margins, most notably in the U.S. Region, primarily due to strategic price increases; improved currency hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the EMEA Region; and higher footwear close-out net pricing margins, most notably in the EMEA Region, primarily due to better inventory management. The factors driving an increased gross margin percentage were partially offset by lower apparel in-line gross pricing margins primarily driven by higher product costs, most notably in the U.S. and EMEA regions, and increased apparel close-out sales, primarily in the U.S. Region. Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Operating overhead expense $ 3,798.2 $ 3,645.4 4% $ 3,116.3 17% Demand creation expense(1) 2,351.4 2,308.3 2% 1,912.4 21% Selling and administrative expense $ 6,149.6 $ 5,953.7 3% $ 5,028.7 18% % of Revenues 32.1 % 32.0% 10 bps 30.8 % 120 bps (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. 26 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 6% during fiscal 2009. The increase in operating overhead in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE-owned retail in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, infrastructure for emerging markets in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions and non-NIKE brand businesses, which more than offset the steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings. On a constant-currency basis, demand creation expense increased 3% during fiscal 2009. Demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal 2009 as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities, most notably traditional media and print advertising. The increase in demand creation the first half of fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to strategic investments in demand creation, including first quarter spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics and the European Football Championships, and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all regions. In fiscal 2010, we intend to reduce selling and administrative spending while shifting resources to fund initiatives that are critical to the achievement of our long-term growth goals. We expect our selling and administrative expenses to decline in the first half of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting both lower operating overhead and demand creation spending, with the latter driven partially by the comparison to the significant prior year demand creation investment around the Beijing Summer Olympics and European Football Championships. Future selling and administrative expense may vary from our current expectations due to changes in the rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment and our reaction to those changes. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 120 basis points, driven primarily by strategic investments in both demand creation and operating overhead. Changes in currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense growth by 4 percentage points. On a constant-currency basis, demand creation expense increased 15% versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to investments in athlete and sport team endorsers of our products, spending around major sporting events including the European Football Championships and the Beijing Summer Olympics, key product initiatives such as Men’s Training in the U.S. and retail presentation. Excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 14% versus the prior year. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE-owned retail, non-NIKE brand businesses, emerging markets and normal wage inflation and performance-based compensation. Restructuring Charges During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we executed a plan to restructure the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million, primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs. These charges are included in our “Corporate” category for segment reporting purposes. Goodwill, Intangible and Other Asset Impairment In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we recognized a $401.3 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbro’s goodwill, intangible and other assets. Although Umbro’s financial 27 Table of Contents performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition. This erosion is a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business. We measured the fair value of Umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies. We believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis, and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. The fair value of Umbro’s indefinite-lived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that Umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark. Our assessments have resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $199.3 million and $181.3 million related to Umbro’s goodwill and trademark, respectively, in fiscal 2009. In addition to the impairment analysis, we determined an equity investment held by Umbro was impaired, and recognized a charge of $20.7 million related to the impairment of this investment. These charges are included in our “Other” category for segment reporting purposes. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 — Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Other (Income) Expense, net Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, other (income) expense, net was a gain of $88.5 million compared to a loss of $7.9 million in fiscal 2008. Other (income) expense, net is primarily comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and results of foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as disposals of fixed assets and other unusual or non-recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2009, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of $43.4 million of foreign currency conversion gains and the recognition of $24.0 million of licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the NIKE Bauer Hockey business. For fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of a $32.0 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and a $28.6 million gain on the sale of the Starter brand business, as well as foreign currency conversion losses of $76.6 million. Foreign currency conversion gains and losses reported in other (income) expense, net, with the exception of gains and losses generated by the EMEA Region and Other businesses, are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (Note 19 — Operating Segments and Related Information). For fiscal 2009, we estimate that the combination of foreign currency conversion gains in other (income) expense, net and the modestly favorable translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses resulted in a year-over-year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $124 million. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 For fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net was a loss of $7.9 million compared to a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net included foreign currency conversion losses that were partially offset by the $32.0 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and the $28.6 million gain on the sale of the Starter brand business. Other (income) expense, net in fiscal 2007 is primarily comprised of the $14.7 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our Oregon footwear distribution center and the $14.2 million benefit from the settlement of the Converse arbitration, partially offset by foreign currency conversion losses. 28 Table of Contents In fiscal 2008, we estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency conversion losses included in other (income) expense, net resulted in a year-over-year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $122 million. Income Taxes Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Effective tax rate 24.0 % 24.8 % (80 ) bps 32.2 % (740 ) bps Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 80 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 due primarily to the tax benefit related to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro that had a favorable impact of 250 basis points. Profits earned outside of the U.S., the impact of the resolution of foreign audit items and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit also favorably impacted our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate. Reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was a one-time tax benefit of $105.4 million, which had a favorable impact of 420 basis points on our effective tax rate. We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2010 will be approximately 25.5%. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 24.8%, 740 basis points lower than the prior year. Over the last few years, several of our international entities generated losses for which we did not recognize the corresponding tax benefits, as the realization of those benefits was uncertain. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we took steps necessary to realize these benefits, resulting in a one-time tax benefit of $105.4 million. Also reflected in the year-over-year effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our on-going effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside the United States; our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Futures Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2009 declined 12% compared to orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2009. This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. The net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 7 percentage points to this reported futures decline versus the same period in the prior year. Excluding this currency impact, lower apparel orders drove most of the decline in overall futures and advance orders. The reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the scheduled noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, Umbro, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands. 29 Table of Contents Operating Segments The breakdown of revenues follows: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008(1) FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007(1) FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) U.S. Region $ 6,542.9 $ 6,414.5 2 % $ 6,131.7 5 % EMEA Region 5,512.2 5,629.2 -2 % 4,764.1 18 % Asia Pacific Region 3,322.0 2,887.6 15 % 2,295.7 26 % Americas Region 1,284.7 1,164.7 10 % 966.7 20 % Total NIKE Brand Revenues 16,661.8 16,096.0 4 % 14,158.2 14 % Other 2,514.3 2,531.0 -1 % 2,167.7 17 % Total NIKE, Inc.

The growth in unit sales was primarily driven by higher demand for our Jordan brand, action sports and kids’ products. The increase in average selling price per pair was attributable to selective price increases, primarily during the first half of fiscal 2009, and increased sales mix of higher priced Jordan brand products, partially offset by increased sales mix of kids’ products which are lower priced. The year-over-year decrease in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2009 reflected a mid-single digit decrease in unit sales, primarily driven by a reduction in products sold to value channel retailers and generally softer demand in the overall apparel market. Average selling prices increased slightly as a result of the reduction in products sold to value retailers, mostly offset by an increased mix of close-out sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels. Pre-tax income for the U.S. Region declined in fiscal 2009 as a result of higher operating overhead expenses and lower gross margins. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE-owned retail. Gross margins decreased as a result of higher warehousing costs, higher retail inventory markdowns and increased customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was the result of low-single digit growth in unit sales and a slight increase in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales and average selling price per pair was driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sportswear products and Jordan brand products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our NIKE brand basketball products. The increase in average selling price per pair was also attributable to strategic price increases and an increased sales mix of higher priced NIKE brand sportswear and Jordan brand products. The year-over-year increase in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2008 reflected an increase in unit sales, mostly offset by lower average selling prices. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by higher close-out sales and increased demand for NIKE brand sports performance products, partially offset by lower unit sales of sportswear and Jordan brand products. Average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of a higher mix of close-out sales. The year-over-year decrease in U.S. equipment revenues during fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit sales of accessory products and fewer close-out sales. Pre-tax income for the U.S. Region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2008 as a result of higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses, partially offset by higher gross margins, driven by footwear. The increase in demand creation was driven by higher sports marketing expenses and investments in the retail presentation of our key wholesale customers. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE-owned retail and normal wage inflation. 31 Table of Contents EMEA Region Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 3,136.7 $ 3,112.6 1 % $ 2,608.0 19 % Apparel 1,970.2 2,083.5 -5 % 1,757.2 19 % Equipment 405.3 433.1 -6 % 398.9 9 % Total Revenues $ 5,512.2 $ 5,629.2 -2 % $ 4,764.1 18 % Pre-tax Income $ 1,316.9 $ 1,281.9 3 % $ 1,050.1 22 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, a number of markets within the region experienced lower revenues, reflecting a more difficult retail environment in these markets. The U.K. remained flat for fiscal 2009 while the emerging markets in the region grew 14%, driven by stronger results in Russia during the first half of fiscal 2009. These results were offset by lower revenues in Southern European markets, including Spain, Italy and France. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 4 percentage points during fiscal 2009. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to mid single-digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for NIKE brand sportswear and kids’ products. The decrease in average selling price per pair was mainly attributable to higher customer discounts and a shift in product mix to lower priced product models, most notably higher volume of kids’ products. On a currency neutral basis, EMEA apparel revenue decreased 4 percentage points during fiscal 2009, primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from a higher mix of close-out sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels, which more than offset a mid single-digit increase in unit sales. The year-over-year increase in pre-tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved year-over-year currency hedge rates which more than offset higher warehousing costs and discounts on in-line products. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was mainly driven by retail expansion across the region. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 11 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2008. Nearly all markets within the region increased revenues during the year. The emerging markets in the region grew nearly 25%, driven by strong results in Russia, Turkey and South Africa. Increases in Northern Europe and the U.K. also contributed significantly to the revenue growth. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to double-digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our NIKE brand soccer and sportswear products. The decrease in 32 Table of Contents average selling price per pair resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product models, most notably within our NIKE brand sportswear product lines. On a currency neutral basis, EMEA apparel revenue increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased unit sales and a slight increase in average selling prices. The increase in unit sales was driven primarily by increased demand for sports performance products, most notably soccer. The increase in pre-tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues, favorable foreign currency translation and a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to improved year-over-year hedge rates and improved margins on close-out product. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by an increase in demand creation spending, primarily attributable to spending around the European Football Championships. As a result of retail expansion and overall business growth across the region, operating overhead expenses increased for the year, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. Asia Pacific Region Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,727.1 $ 1,499.5 15 % $ 1,159.2 29 % Apparel 1,322.3 1,140.0 16 % 909.3 25 % Equipment 272.6 248.1 10 % 227.2 9 % Total Revenues $ 3,322.0 $ 2,887.6 15 % $ 2,295.7 26 % Pre-tax Income $ 853.4 $ 694.2 23 % $ 515.4 35 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 3 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all countries across the region delivered revenue growth. China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2009 revenues increased 22% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE products and sales through existing stores. China’s rate of revenue growth slowed to 6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as we lapped very strong growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. On a currency neutral basis, revenues in Japan were up 1% compared to fiscal 2008. Footwear and apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2009 were driven primarily by an increase in unit sales, most notably in China. The growth in unit sales was slightly offset by a low-single digit reduction in average selling prices in fiscal 2009 resulting primarily from increased discounts on in-line products provided retailers to manage inventory levels. The increase in pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2009 was driven by higher revenues and improved gross margins, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expenses. Gross margins improved versus the prior year, primarily driven by improved year-over-year standard foreign currency rates and reduced warehousing costs, which more than offset increased product discounts. Selling and administrative expenses increased, but represented a lower percentage of revenues in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to retail and infrastructure expansion, primarily in China, and spending around brand events. 33 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Nearly all countries across the region delivered revenue growth on a currency neutral basis. China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2008 revenues increased 50% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by the expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE products and sales through existing stores. Constant-currency revenues in Japan increased 2% during fiscal 2008. Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2008 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China, partially offset by lower average selling prices driven primarily by a shift in mix from higher priced to lower priced models. The year-over-year increase in apparel revenue was driven by increased demand in China. The increase in pre-tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2008 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by reduced warehousing costs, improved year-over-year standard currency rates and improved margins on close-out product. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics. Overall business growth across the region combined with retail expansion, primarily in China, also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses, which grew slightly slower than revenues. Americas Region Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 892.1 $ 792.7 13 % $ 679.6 17 % Apparel 287.8 265.4 8 % 193.9 37 % Equipment 104.8 106.6 -2 % 93.2 14 % Total Revenues $ 1,284.7 $ 1,164.7 10 % $ 966.7 20 % Pre-tax Income $ 274.1 $ 242.3 13 % $ 199.3 22 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 9 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Americas Region reported growth in all markets, led by Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The increase in pre-tax income for fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage, which more than offset lower gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2008, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2009. The increase in selling and administrative expense was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead expenses mainly driven by spending around retail marketing programs, brand events and normal wage inflation. The slight decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 was mainly due to a higher sales mix of lower margin footwear products and higher import costs, which more than offset improved year-on-year standard foreign currency rates. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 7 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Americas Region reported growth in all markets, led by Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. 34 Table of Contents The increase in pre-tax income for fiscal 2008 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues, improved gross margins and operating overhead leverage, combined with favorable foreign currency translation. These factors were partially offset by higher demand creation spending as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement was driven primarily by higher in-line net pricing margins resulting from a better mix of products sold and fewer discounts offered in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in demand creation spending during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to investments in sports marketing, most notably in soccer, brand events and investments in our retail presentation. Other Businesses Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Converse $ 915.3 $ 729.0 26 % $ 563.8 29 % NIKE Golf 648.3 725.2 -11 % 646.3 12 % Cole Haan 471.6 496.2 -5 % 468.6 6 % Hurley 202.9 171.1 19 % 150.6 14 % Umbro 174.0 53.9 223 % — — Bauer — 201.9 -100 % 166.1 22 % Exeter — 35.1 -100 % 67.7 -48 % Other 102.2 118.6 -14 % 104.6 13 % Revenues $ 2,514.3 $ 2,531.0 -1 % $ 2,167.7 17 % Pre-tax Income $ (196.7 ) $ 364.9 -154 % $ 299.7 22 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, our Other businesses were primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro. For fiscal 2008, our Other businesses were primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008). The slight decrease in Other businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business. Excluding the loss of revenue from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business and the addition of Umbro, Other businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 would have increased 5%, driven by the strong performance from Converse and Hurley, offset by sales decreases at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan, due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. Pre-tax income for Other businesses declined for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a $401.3 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbro’s goodwill, intangible and other assets. Excluding the impairment charge, the loss of income from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business along with the dilutive impact of Umbro, pre-tax income for Other businesses would have decreased by 28%, driven by declines in operating results at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 — Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in Other business revenues was driven by higher revenues across most businesses, most notably Converse and NIKE Golf. The increase in Converse and NIKE Golf is mainly driven by strong consumer demand both in the United States and international markets. The growth at Cole Haan is mainly driven by the strong results at Company-owned retail stores. During fiscal 2008, growth at Converse and NIKE Golf, combined with margin improvements across most businesses drove the year-over-year increase in pre-tax income. Fiscal 2007 pre-tax income included a $14.2 million benefit relating to the settlement of an arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South American licensee. Fiscal 2008 pre-tax income for our Other businesses would have increased approximately 18% versus fiscal 2007 excluding this favorable settlement. On March 3, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Umbro, a United Kingdom-based global soccer brand, for a purchase price of £290.5 million in cash (approximately $576.4 million), inclusive of direct transaction costs. This acquisition was intended to strengthen our market position in the United Kingdom and expand NIKE’s global leadership in soccer, a key area of growth for the Company. This acquisition also provides positions in emerging soccer markets such as China, Russia and Brazil. The results of Umbro’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and in the “Other” operating segment since the date of acquisition. Umbro, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange prior to our acquisition, reported in their 2006 annual report that revenues for calendar year 2006 were approximately $276 million (£149.5 million), and estimated that the combination of Umbro’s calendar year 2006 wholesale revenue and estimated sales revenue earned by Umbro’s licensees from the sale of Umbro products totaled approximately $755 million (£409.4 million). Following a strategic review of the Company’s existing business portfolio, we concluded that the Starter and NIKE Bauer Hockey businesses did not align with our long-term growth priorities. On December 17, 2007 we completed the sale of the Starter brand business for $60 million in cash. On April 17, 2008, we completed the sale of the NIKE Bauer Hockey business for net proceeds of $189.2 million after working capital adjustments. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $28.6 million and $32.0 million, respectively, which are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre-tax income in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (Note 19 — Operating Segments and Related Information). Corporate Expense Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Corporate Expense $ (1,629.1 ) $ (1,482.4 ) -10 % $ (1,250.7 ) -19 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s corporate headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, foreign currency gains and losses, including hedge gains and losses, corporate eliminations and other items. The increase in corporate expense in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million, consisting primarily of cash charges related to severance costs. 36 Table of Contents Foreign currency gains and losses include conversion gains and losses generated by our centrally managed foreign currency hedging program and other conversion gains and losses. Foreign currency gains and losses also include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to our regions. With the exception of foreign currency gains and losses generated by the EMEA Region and Other businesses, which are reported within their respective operating results, substantially all of the Company’s remaining conversion gains and losses as well as standard to actual foreign currency gains and losses reside at Corporate. In fiscal 2009, foreign currency conversion gains (losses) reported in Corporate expense totaled $45.9 million compared to ($76.3) million in fiscal 2008, which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal 2009 versus a net hedge loss in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in corporate expense from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by increased employee compensation expense due to the increase in centralized corporate functions, higher performance-based compensation as well as increased investments in demand creation, including other spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics. In fiscal 2008, foreign currency conversion loss reported in Corporate expense totaled $76.3 million compared to $31.7 million in fiscal 2007, which was primarily driven by a larger net loss from currency hedges in fiscal 2008 versus 2007. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the U.S., in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions, such as sales, purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. Our primary foreign currency exposures are related to U.S. dollar transactions at wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in the Euro, British pound, Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements, dependent upon hedge horizons. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis, to manage those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. on a consolidated basis. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio, and by hedging remaining material exposures, where practical, using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. The Company’s hedging policies are designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as issued and amended (“FAS 133”). We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Transactional exposures We transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, which subjects us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: 1. Inventory Purchases — Most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. This generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other 37 Table of Contents than the U.S. dollar. A weaker U.S. dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiary’s functional currency whereas a stronger U.S. dollar increases the inventory cost. 2. Non-Functional Currency Revenues — A portion of our EMEA Region revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British pound), but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency, generating foreign currency exposures. 3. Other Revenues and Costs — Non-functional currency revenues and costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other payments, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. 4. Non-functional currency asset and liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement under SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation,” (“FAS 52”), which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense within our consolidated results of operations. Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 23 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including non-functional currency revenues and expenses. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with FAS 133. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2009 and 2008 was $248.0 million and $95.3 million in assets and $12.2 million and $149.8 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”), a component of shareholders’ equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under FAS 133. In these cases, the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related asset or liability. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2009 and 2008, was $13.2 million and $34.2 million in assets and $34.3 million and $7.3 million in liabilities, respectively. The change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings. The impact of such instruments is included in other (income) expense, net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged. Refer to Note 18 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail. Translational exposures Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders’ equity. In preparing our consolidated statements of income, foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. In translation, a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and pre-tax income was a net translation benefit (detriment) of ($199.4) million and $4.0 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under FAS 133. We utilize forward contracts and options to partially, or entirely, hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. dollar investments. This has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2009 and 2008 was $103.6 million and $7.8 million in assets and $0 and $14.4 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other (income) expense, net in the period during which the hedged available-for-sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. For fiscal 2009, we estimate that the combination of foreign currency conversion gains in other (income) expense, net and the modestly favorable translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses resulted in a year-over-year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $124 million. Refer to Note 18 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. During fiscal 2008, we began to hedge certain net investment positions in Euro-functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments, with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings. In accordance with FAS 133, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI; concurrent with settlement, we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate. The impact of net investment hedges reflected in OCI was a pre-tax gain (loss) of $161.4 million and ($68.6) million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $191.3 million and ($76.0) million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009 compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2008. This decrease was mainly due to an increase in cash used for our working capital as a result of lower accounts payable and a higher accounts receivable balance. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to lower purchases of inventory as well as a reduction in overall spending. The higher accounts receivable balance is a result of a longer collection cycle, reflecting a more challenging retail environment experienced by our customers in the EMEA and U.S. regions. 39 Table of Contents Cash used by investing activities was $0.8 billion during fiscal 2009 compared to $0.5 billion in fiscal 2008. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a net increase in short-term investments purchased in fiscal 2009. The increase in net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2009 was partially offset by proceeds from settlement of net investment hedges of $191.3 million. During the second half of fiscal 2008, we began to use net investment hedges to mitigate the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries. Cash used in financing activities was $0.7 billion during fiscal 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases to preserve liquidity given the current financial market conditions. In fiscal 2009, we purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $639.0 million. As of the end of fiscal 2009, we have repurchased 49.2 million shares for $2.7 billion under the $3 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in June 2006. In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase program. The new program will commence upon completion of our current $3 billion share repurchase program. We expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2009, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 330.2 $ 281.3 $ 233.6 $ 195.6 $ 168.6 $ 588.5 $ 1,797.8 Long-term Debt 32.0 6.9 167.1 46.9 56.9 144.6 $ 454.4 Endorsement Contracts(1) 711.7 654.6 601.0 509.7 431.0 1,293.9 $ 4,201.9 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 1,985.7 — — — — — $ 1,985.7 Other(3) 247.1 106.3 67.8 78.0 3.0 2.0 $ 504.2 Total $ 3,306.7 $ 1,049.1 $ 1,069.5 $ 830.2 $ 659.5 $ 2,029.0 $ 8,944.0 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of 40 Table of Contents product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2009. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2009. The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $273.9 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2009. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2009. Please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2009 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 342.9 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 78.5 As of May 31, 2009, letters of credit of $154.8 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In December 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which $760 million in debt securities may be issued. As of May 31, 2009, no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration. We may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal 2010 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi-year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the 41 Table of Contents event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2009, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of May 31, 2009, $100 million was outstanding under this program at a weighted average interest rate of 0.40%. This borrowing was repaid subsequent to May 31, 2009. We may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2010 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Continuing volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. Notwithstanding these adverse market conditions, we believe that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards On December 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS 161”), which provides revised guidance for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The adoption of FAS 161 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. For additional information, see Note 18 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. On June 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”) for financial assets and liabilities, which clarifies the meaning of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under FAS 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the assets or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income when they occur. The effective date of the provisions of FAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities, except for items recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, was deferred by FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2 (“FSP FAS 157-2”) and is effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The adoption of FAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Also effective June 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“FAS 159”), which allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. As of May 31, 2009, we have not elected the fair value option for any additional financial assets and liabilities beyond those already prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active” (“FSP FAS 157-3”). FSP FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of FAS 157 in a market that is not active and defines additional key criteria in determining the fair value of a 42 Table of Contents financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP FAS 157-3 applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in accordance with FAS 157. FSP FAS 157-3 was effective upon issuance and the application of FSP FAS 157-3 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, “Subsequent Events” (“FAS 165”), which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. The provisions of FAS 165 are effective for the quarter ending August 31, 2009. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (“FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1”), which amends SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”, and APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual reporting periods. The provisions of FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 are effective for the quarter ending August 31, 2009. We do not expect the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141(R)”) and SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“FAS 160”). These standards aim to improve, simplify, and converge international standards of accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The provisions of FAS 141(R) are effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after June 1, 2009. Generally, the effects of FAS 141(R) will depend on future acquisitions. The provisions of FAS No. 160 are effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2009. We do not expect that the adoption of FAS 160 will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FSP FAS 142-3”). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under FAS 141(R), and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The provisions of FSP FAS 142-3 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect 43 Table of Contents working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to 44 Table of Contents cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. 45 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit’s business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted (“FAS 133”), have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes beyond the threshold allowed by FAS 133, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes 46 Table of Contents occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When appropriately designated as a hedge in accordance with FAS 133, the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. In accordance with FAS 133, we consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock-based Compensation As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123R”). Under the provisions of FAS 123R, the fair value of stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“FAS 109”). Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the 47 Table of Contents actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain 48 Table of Contents anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve to eighteen months, although at May 31, 2009 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 23 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by one of our European subsidiaries. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. See Section “Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $67.8 million and $34.9 million at May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively. The VaR increased, despite a reduction in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative instruments, as a result of increased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2009 as compared to 49 Table of Contents May 31, 2008. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $207.4 million and $32.3 million during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. We, therefore, consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2009.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE-owned retail, including stores and e-commerce, independent distributors, franchisees and licensees worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences. Aside from achieving long-term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas: • Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline, • Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste, • Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs, • Improving working capital efficiency, and • Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders. Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: • High single-digit revenue growth, • Mid-teens earnings per share growth, • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and • Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. 22 Table of Contents Since the adoption of this long-term strategy in 2001, NIKE, Inc.’s revenues and earnings per share have grown 8% and 14%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. During the same period, our return on invested capital has increased from 14% to 21%. While macroeconomic conditions in fiscal 2010 continued to remain challenging, putting significant pressure on consumer spending in most markets worldwide, we have continued to focus on achieving appropriate financial performance, while extending our market leadership and positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. NIKE, Inc.’s fiscal 2010 revenues declined 1% to $19.0 billion, net income increased 28% to $1.9 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.86, a 27% increase versus fiscal 2009. Our fiscal 2009 reported results contain significant non-comparable transactions, including an after-tax charge of $145 million for restructuring activities, recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and an after-tax charge of $241 million for the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Excluding these non-comparable items, our fiscal 2010 net income would have increased 2% and diluted earnings per share would have increased 1% compared to fiscal 2009 (see Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non-Comparable items below). The increase in net income excluding non-comparable items was primarily driven by an improved gross margin percentage and a reduction in our effective tax rate, which more than offset the reduction in revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily the result of favorable product mix, cost reduction initiatives, lower input costs and sales growth in our NIKE-owned retail business. Our year-over-year effective tax rate improvement was driven by continued benefit from our international businesses, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in performance-based compensation as well as investments in our NIKE-owned retail business, which more than offset reductions in compensation expense resulting from restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, diluted earnings per share grew at a slightly lower rate than net income given higher average outstanding shares. In fiscal 2010, we increased cash flow from operations as a result of working capital reductions, reflecting our efforts to aggressively manage inventory levels and accounts receivable collections. At May 31, 2010, our inventory and accounts receivable balances were down 13% and 8%, respectively, compared to May 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, we also returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal 2009. Although most of our businesses reported revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010, the majority returned to growth in the second half of fiscal 2010. Futures orders for NIKE Brand Footwear and Apparel scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased 7% as compared to the same periods in the prior year. While we continue to believe that the Company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective, our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world. These conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways, including lower revenue from slowing consumer/customer demand for our products, reduced profit margins and/or increased costs, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experienced by suppliers and customers. Our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change (In millions, except per share data) Revenues $ 19,014 $ 19,176 -1 % $ 18,627 3 % Cost of sales 10,214 10,572 -3 % 10,240 3 % Gross margin 8,800 8,604 2 % 8,387 3 % Gross margin % 46.3 % 44.9 % 45.0 % Selling and administrative expense 6,326 6,150 3 % 5,954 3 % % of Revenues 33.3 % 32.1 % 32.0 % Restructuring charges — 195 — — — Goodwill impairment — 199 — — — Intangible and other asset impairment — 202 — — — Income before income taxes 2,517 1,957 29 % 2,503 -22 % Net income 1,907 1,487 28 % 1,883 -21 % Diluted earnings per share 3.86 3.03 27 % 3.74 -19 % Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non-Comparable Items(1) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09Change (dollars in millions, except per share data) Net income, as reported $ 1,907 $ 1,487 28 % Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax(2) — 145 Umbro impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, net of tax(3) — 241 Net income, excluding non-comparable items $ 1,907 $ 1,873 2 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 3.86 $ 3.03 27 % Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax(2) — 0.29 Umbro impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, net of tax(3) — 0.49 Diluted earnings per share, excluding non-comparable items $ 3.86 $ 3.81 1 % Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 493.9 490.7 (1) This schedule is intended to satisfy the quantitative reconciliation for non-GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, this schedule is provided to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding these non-comparable items for fiscal 2009. (2) During fiscal 2009, we announced a plan to restructure the organization of the Company. As part of this plan, we streamlined our management structure and eliminated redundancies to enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market, and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we recorded $195 million of pre-tax restructuring charges in fiscal 2009. (3) During fiscal 2009, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbro’s goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark and other assets. The tax benefit related to this impairment charge reduced our effective tax rate by 250 basis points for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009. 24 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges(1) Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change FY09 vs.FY08% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges(1) (In millions) Revenues $ 19,014 $ 19,176 -1 % -2 % $ 18,627 3 % 4 % (1) Results have been restated using exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. declined 2%, driven primarily by a 2% decline in revenues for the NIKE Brand. All of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of Emerging Markets, reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets, most notably in our Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. By product group, revenues for our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business were down 1% compared to the prior year. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel and equipment revenues declined 5% and 7%, respectively. While our wholesale business remains the largest component of our NIKE Brand revenues, our NIKE-owned retail business continues to grow, representing approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to 13% in fiscal 2009. Revenues from our Other Businesses were comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Inc., Hurley International, LLC, NIKE Golf and Umbro, Ltd. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 4% for fiscal 2010, driven by increased revenues at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset revenue declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. Futures Orders Translated into US dollars at prior year exchange rates, worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2010 were 10% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. This futures growth was driven by increases in unit sales volume for our footwear products and growth in average unit price for both of our apparel and footwear products. Futures orders increased 7% when translated at forecasted exchange rates for the next six months, which approximate current spot rates. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, and because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advance/futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE equipment, sales from our Other Businesses and certain retail sales across all brands. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 4%, driven primarily by a 4% increase in revenues for the NIKE Brand. The North America geography contributed nearly 1 percentage point of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009, while the remaining geographies contributed 25 Table of Contents over 2 percentage points. During fiscal 2009, most of our geographies posted higher revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business reported revenue growth of 6% and contributed $575 million of incremental revenue. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel revenues were in line with the prior year, while equipment revenues declined 2% or $20 million. Our Other Businesses, comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, and Umbro in fiscal 2009, constituted the remaining revenue. In fiscal 2008, our Other Businesses also included Exeter Brands Group (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007) and NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008). Umbro was acquired on March 3, 2008. Revenues for these businesses were flat compared to fiscal 2008. Gross Margin Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 8,800 $ 8,604 2% $ 8,387 3% Gross Margin % 46.3 % 44.9 % 140 bps 45.0 % (10 bps ) Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 140 basis points higher than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows: • Improved in-line product margins across most geographies, driven by reduced raw material and freight costs as well as favorable changes in product mix; • Improved inventory positions, most notably in North America and Western Europe, which drove a shift in mix from discounted close-out to higher margin in-line sales; and • Growth of NIKE-owned retail as a percentage of total revenue, across most NIKE Brand geographies, driven by an increase in both new store openings and comparable store sales. Together, these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately 160 basis points for fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, primarily affecting our Emerging Markets and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. We anticipate our gross margins in fiscal 2011 may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic factors including changes in currency exchange rates and rising costs for product input costs. We also anticipate higher air freight costs as we work with our suppliers to meet increasing demand for certain running footwear products in the first half of the year. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decline in consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were lower gross pricing margins and increased discounts which, when combined, decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 60 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by improved hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. Gross pricing margins were lower, primarily driven by higher product input costs, most notably for footwear products. Higher levels of discounts were provided across all businesses in fiscal 2009 to manage inventory levels. 26 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs. FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs. FY08% Change (In millions) Operating overhead expense $ 3,970 $ 3,798 5% $ 3,645 4% Demand creation expense(1) 2,356 2,352 0% 2,309 2% Selling and administrative expense $ 6,326 $ 6,150 3% $ 5,954 3% % of Revenues 33.3 % 32.1% 120 bps 32.0 % 10 bps (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2010. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead expense increased 4% compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performance-based compensation and investments in NIKE-owned retail. These increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal 2010 as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense. Demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year, as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising. In fiscal 2011, we will continue to focus our resources on those investments that drive sustainable and profitable growth. We expect demand creation will increase at a slightly slower rate than revenues, with spending weighted toward the first quarter driven by key events including the 2010 World Cup. We anticipate operating overhead will grow at a mid single-digit rate, with faster growth in the first half of the fiscal year, driven by increased investments in our NIKE-owned retail business. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 6% during fiscal 2009. The increase in operating overhead was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE-owned retail in the North America, Western Europe, Greater China, and Japan geographies, infrastructure for the Emerging Markets and Central and Eastern Europe geographies as well as for our non-NIKE Brand businesses, which more than offset steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending, including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings. On a constant-currency basis, demand creation expense increased 3% during fiscal 2009. Demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal 2009 as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities, most notably traditional media and print advertising. The increase in demand creation during the first half of fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to strategic investments, including first quarter spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics and the European Football Championships, and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all geographies. Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2009, we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result 27 Table of Contents of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million in fiscal 2009, primarily consisting of cash severance costs. These charges are included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes. Goodwill, Intangible and Other Asset Impairment In fiscal 2009, we recognized a $401 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbro’s goodwill, intangible and other assets. Although Umbro’s financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition. This erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business. We measured the fair value of Umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies. We believe the use of both models compensated for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis, and this combination was indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. The fair value of Umbro’s indefinite-lived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that Umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark. Our assessments resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $199 million and $181 million related to Umbro’s goodwill and trademark, respectively, in fiscal 2009. In addition to the impairment analysis, we determined an equity investment held by Umbro was also impaired, and recognized a charge of $21 million related to the impairment of that investment. These charges are included in our “Other Businesses” category for segment reporting purposes. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 — Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income) Expense, net Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs. FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs. FY08% Change (In millions) Other (income) expense, net $ (49 ) $ (89 ) -45 % $ 8 — Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Other (income) expense, net is primarily comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, and unusual or non-recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2010, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains and the recognition of previously deferred licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey. For fiscal 2010, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains included in other (income) expense, net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $34 million. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of $43 million of foreign currency conversion gains and the recognition of $24 million of licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the 28 Table of Contents NIKE Bauer Hockey business. For fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of a $32 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and a $29 million gain on the sale of the Starter brand business, as well as foreign currency conversion losses of $77 million. For fiscal 2009, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $124 million. Income Taxes Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs. FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs. FY08% Change Effective tax rate 24.2 % 24.0 % 20 bps 24.8 % (80 ) bps Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of Umbro’s goodwill, intangible and other assets. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 26.5%, 230 basis points higher than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to the continued benefit from our international operations, where tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 will be in line with our fiscal 2010 effective tax rate. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 80 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 due primarily to the tax benefit related to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro which had a favorable impact of 250 basis points. Profits earned outside of the U.S., the impact of the resolution of foreign audit items and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit also favorably impacted our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate. Reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was a one-time tax benefit of $105 million, which had a favorable impact of 420 basis points on our effective tax rate. Operating Segments As part of the restructuring initiative that took place in fiscal 2009, the Company changed the geographic structure of NIKE Brand to six geographies to streamline its management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. Effective June 1, 2009, the Company’s new reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand became: North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into four regions: U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, “EMEA”), Asia Pacific, and Americas. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any non-functional currency revenues or product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates. For all NIKE Brand operating segments, differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the centrally managed foreign 29 Table of Contents exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, foreign currency hedge results along with other conversion gains and losses generated by the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographies.

Effective June 1, 2009, the primary financial measure we use to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (commonly referred to as “EBIT”) which represents net income before interest expense (income), net and income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Previously, we evaluated the performance of individual operating segments based on income before income taxes. Financial information has been reclassified to conform to the new primary financial measure we use. As discussed in Note 19 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in EBIT of our operating segments. 30 Table of Contents The breakdown of earnings before interest and taxes is as follows: Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009(1) FY10 vs.FY09% Change Fiscal 2008(1) FY09 vs.FY08% Change (dollars in millions) North America $ 1,538 $ 1,429 8 % $ 1,460 -2 % Western Europe 856 939 -9 % 923 2 % Central and Eastern Europe 281 415 -32 % 358 16 % Greater China 637 575 11 % 431 33 % Japan 180 205 -12 % 179 15 % Emerging Markets 493 343 44 % 307 12 % Global Brand Divisions (867 ) (811 ) -7 % (737 ) -10 % Total NIKE Brand 3,118 3,095 1 % 2,921 6 % Other Businesses 299 (193 ) — 359 -154 % Corporate (894 ) (955 ) 6 % (854 ) -12 % Total NIKE Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 2,523 $ 1,947 30 % $ 2,426 -20 % Interest expense (income), net 6 (10 ) — (77 ) -87 % Total NIKE Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes $ 2,517 $ 1,957 29 % $ 2,503 -22 % (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2010 presentation.

This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our NIKE-owned retail business, driven primarily by an increase in comparable store sales. On a currency neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 7% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. During fiscal 2010, the decrease in North America footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a low single-digit percentage decrease in unit sales, while average selling price per pair remained flat. The decline in unit sales was primarily driven by lower sales for our kids’ and running products in the first half of fiscal 2010. 31 Table of Contents North America apparel revenue during fiscal 2010 was flat when compared to fiscal 2009, which was reflective of a high single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, offset by a low double-digit percentage decrease in unit sales. Both the increase in average selling price per unit and the decrease in unit sales were primarily a result of fewer close-out sales compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the increase in North America’s EBIT was primarily the result of improved gross margins combined with a slight decrease in selling and administrative expense, driven by a reduction in demand creation expense compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to a shift in mix from close-out to in-line sales, growth of NIKE-owned retail as a percentage of total sales, improved in-line product margins and lower warehousing costs. The reduction in demand creation expense was primarily attributable to lower spending on advertising. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the increase in North America footwear revenue was the result of low single-digit growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was primarily driven by higher demand for our Jordan brand, action sports and kids’ products. The increase in average selling price per pair was attributable to selective price increases, primarily during the first half of fiscal 2009, and increased sales mix of higher priced Jordan brand products, partially offset by increased sales mix of kids’ products which are generally lower priced. The year-over-year decrease in North America apparel revenues during fiscal 2009 reflected a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales, primarily driven by a reduction in products sold to value channel retailers and generally softer demand in the overall apparel market. Average selling prices increased slightly as a result of the reduction in products sold to value retailers, mostly offset by an increased mix of close-out sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels. EBIT for the North America geography declined in fiscal 2009 as a result of higher operating overhead expense and lower gross margins. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE-owned retail. Gross margins decreased as a result of higher warehousing costs, higher retail inventory markdowns and increased customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels.

Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, futures orders scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 11% higher compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by strong growth across most markets and product categories. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the decrease in footwear revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of low single-digit decreases in both average selling price and unit sales. The decrease in average selling price was attributable to higher customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels, while the reduction in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories. The year-over-year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a high single-digit decline in unit sales combined with a mid single-digit decrease in average selling price. The decrease in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories, while the decrease in average selling price was a result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. For fiscal 2010, EBIT for Western Europe declined at a faster rate than revenues, as the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues more than offset the improvements in gross margin percentage. The increase in selling administrative expense was primarily driven by a higher level of both demand creation spending around the 2010 World Cup and operating overhead expense as a result of investments in NIKE-owned retail and higher performance-based compensation. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher in-line product margins, a smaller proportion of close-out sales and reduced inventory obsolescence expense as a result of our leaner inventory positions. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, a number of markets within the geography experienced lower revenues, reflecting a more difficult retail environment. Revenues for the Southern European markets, including Spain, Italy and France declined, while the U.K. & Ireland remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to a low single-digit growth in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for kids and NIKE Brand sportswear products. Average selling price per pair remained flat compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from a higher mix of close-out sales and higher levels of discounts provided to retailers to manage inventory levels, which more than offset a low-single-digit increase in unit sales. The year-over-year increase in EBIT for the Western Europe geography during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by slightly higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved year-over-year standard currency rates which more than offset higher warehousing costs and discounts on in-line products. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by retail expansion across the geography. 33 Table of Contents Central and Eastern Europe Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change FY09 vs.FY08% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (dollars in millions) Revenues Footwear $ 660 $ 752 -12 % -13 % $ 702 7 % 13 % Apparel 399 508 -21 % -22 % 499 2 % 5 % Equipment 91 113 -19 % -19 % 108 5 % 8 % Total Revenues $ 1,150 $ 1,373 -16 % -17 % $ 1,309 5 % 9 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 281 $ 415 -32 % $ 358 16 % Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Economic conditions in Central and Eastern Europe remained difficult as most markets within the geography experienced lower revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. We are beginning to see signs of stabilization in these markets as a result of improving macroeconomic conditions, increasing brand momentum, and tight management of inventory. On a currency-neutral basis, future orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 3% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in footwear revenue was due to a decline in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2009. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. The year-over-year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a double-digit decrease in average selling price and a mid single-digit decline in unit sales. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels, while the decline in unit sales was due to lower sales in most key product categories. The year-over-year decrease in Central and Eastern Europe’s EBIT during fiscal 2010 was the result of lower revenues, a decline in gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expense. The decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, as well as higher discounts provided to customers. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in the reserve for bad debts along with increased investments in NIKE-owned retail. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 On a currency neutral basis, revenue for the Central and Eastern Europe geography grew by approximately 9 percentage points in fiscal 2009, driven by stronger results in Russia. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a double-digit growth in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for NIKE Brand sportswear, kids, and running products. The increase in apparel revenues was primarily driven by a double digit percentage increase in unit sales, partially offset by a mid-single digit decrease in average selling price, resulting from a higher mix of close-out sales. 34 Table of Contents The year-over-year increase in EBIT for Central and Eastern Europe during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenues and improved gross margin percentage. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved in-line product margins which more than offset higher discounts on in-line products and warehousing costs.

Greater China began to gain momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010, as revenues increased 11% as compared to the second half of fiscal 2009. On a currency-neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 16% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a mid single-digit increase in average selling price, partially offset by a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to strategic product pricing increases, while the decrease in unit sales was primarily driven by lower discounts on in-line products compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales across most major categories, which more than offset a low single-digit increase in average selling price primarily driven by strategic product pricing increases. EBIT for Greater China increased at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margins and reductions in demand creation spending attributable to comparisons against higher prior year spending around the Beijing Olympics. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Greater China continued to deliver strong results in fiscal 2009 as revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE products and sales through existing stores. China’s rate of revenue growth slowed to 6% on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as we lapped very strong growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase in both footwear and apparel revenues was driven primarily by a double-digit increase in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was partially offset by a reduction in average selling price in fiscal 2009, resulting primarily from increased discounts on in-line products provided to retailers to manage inventory levels. 35 Table of Contents The increase in EBIT for Greater China for fiscal 2009 was driven by higher revenues, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Selling and administrative expense increased, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2009. The increase in selling and administrative expense during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to retail and infrastructure expansion and spending around brand events.

The decline in revenues was reflective of a difficult and highly promotional marketplace in Japan. As we enter fiscal 2011, we anticipate macroeconomic conditions in Japan to remain difficult. On a currency-neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 16% lower compared to the same period in the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the decrease in Japan’s EBIT was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense, driven by increased investments in NIKE-owned retail, which more than offset improved gross margins. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, the increase in Japan’s footwear revenue was driven primarily by a mid-single digit increase in unit sales, partially offset by a reduction in average selling price. The slight increase in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a low-single digit increase in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in EBIT for fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 2008. 36 Table of Contents Emerging Markets Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change FY09 vs.FY08% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (dollars in millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,356 $ 1,106 23 % 21 % $ 1,031 7 % 20 % Apparel 532 438 21 % 19 % 436 0 % 14 % Equipment 154 158 -3 % -4 % 163 -3 % 8 % Total Revenues $ 2,042 $ 1,702 20 % 18 % $ 1,630 4 % 17 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 493 $ 343 44 % $ 307 12 % Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all markets in the Emerging Markets geography reported revenue growth for fiscal 2010, most notably Brazil, Mexico and Korea, driven by sales growth in all product categories. Futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased 30% on a currency neutral basis. Footwear revenue growth was primarily driven by a double-digit growth in unit sales and a mid single-digit increase in average selling price per pair during fiscal 2010, reflective of strong demand for most NIKE Brand product categories in all markets within the geography. For fiscal 2010, the increase in Emerging Markets’ EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth combined with lower selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to lower operating overhead expense resulting from fiscal 2009 restructuring activities. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable year-over-year standard currency rates assigned to the geography, which more than offset improved in-line product margins. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most markets in the Emerging Markets geography reported revenue growth in fiscal 2009, led by Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a double-digit increase in unit sales, partially offset by a low-single digit reduction in average selling price. The increase in EBIT for fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by a reduction in spending around advertising and sports marketing. 37 Table of Contents Global Brand Divisions Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09 % Change FY10 vs.FY09 % ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08 % Change FY09 vs.FY08 % ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (dollars in millions) Revenues $ 105 $ 96 9 % 12 % $ 118 -19 % -9 % Loss Before Interest and Taxes $ (867 ) $ (811 ) 7 % $ (737 ) 10 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment and selling, general and administrative expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in Global Brand Division’s loss before interest and taxes was largely due to increases in centrally managed demand creation expense and performance-based compensation, which more than offset an increase in licensing revenues. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by the centralization of certain marketing production costs. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The increase in Global Brand Division’s loss before interest and taxes was mainly attributable to a decrease in licensing revenues and an increase in selling and administrative expense driven by higher operating overhead and increased demand creation spending.

For fiscal 2010, the increase in Other Businesses’ revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset the declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. In fiscal 2009, EBIT for our Other Businesses included a $401 million pre-tax non-cash charge relating to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro. Excluding this impairment charge, EBIT for our Other Businesses would have increased 43%, as a result of higher revenues, improved gross margins across most businesses, and lower demand creation spending. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, our Other Businesses were comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro. For fiscal 2008, our Other Businesses primarily included Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008). Excluding the loss of revenue from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business and the addition of Umbro, Other Businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 would have increased 6%, driven by the strong performance from Converse and Hurley, offset by sales decreases at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan, due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. EBIT for Other Businesses declined for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a $401 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbro’s goodwill intangible and other assets. Excluding the impairment charge, the loss of income from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business along with the dilutive impact of Umbro, earnings before interest and taxes for Other Businesses would have decreased by 28%, driven by declines in operating results at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 — Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09 % Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08 % Change (dollars in millions) Revenues $ (24 ) $ — — $ — — Loss Before Interest and Taxes $ (894 ) $ (955 ) -6 % $ (854 ) 12 % Fiscal 2010 Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency revenue-related hedge gains and losses generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities, which are used to record any non-functional currency revenues into the entity’s functional currency. Corporate’s loss before interest and taxes consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s corporate headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses, corporate eliminations and other items. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management 39 Table of Contents program, other conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non- functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to each entity in NIKE Brand geographic operating segments, which are used to record any non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses, generated by the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2009, results for Corporate included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $195 million. Excluding this restructuring charge, loss before interest and taxes for Corporate would have increased by 18%, primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The increase in Corporate’s loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million, consisting primarily of cash charges related to severance costs. In fiscal 2009, foreign currency conversion gains (losses) reported in Corporate expense totaled $46 million compared to ($76) million in fiscal 2008, which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal 2009 versus a net hedge loss in fiscal 2008. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the U.S. we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates in the normal course of business. Foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions, such as sales, purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. Our primary foreign currency exposures are related to U.S. dollar transactions at wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements, dependent upon hedge horizons. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally, on a portfolio basis, to manage those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. on a consolidated basis. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and by hedging remaining material exposures, where practical, using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. The Company’s hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Transactional exposures We transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, which subjects us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: 1. Inventory Purchases — Most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. This generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. A weaker U.S. dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiary’s functional currency whereas a stronger U.S. dollar increases the inventory cost. 40 Table of Contents 2. Non-Functional Currency Revenues — A portion of our Western Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound), but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency, generating foreign currency exposure. 3. Other Revenues and Costs — Non-functional currency revenues and costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other payments, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. 4. Non-functional Currency Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. As of May 31, 2010, we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 18 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including non-functional currency revenues and expenses. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $206 million and $248 million in assets and $25 million and $12 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”), a component of shareholders’ equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion was a gain of $5 million for the year ended May 31, 2010. The ineffective portion was immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. In these cases, the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency asset or liability. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $104 million and $13 million in assets and $140 million and $34 million in liabilities, respectively. The change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings. The impact of such instruments is included in other (income) expense, net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged. Refer to Note 18 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Translational exposures Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders’ equity. In preparing our consolidated statements of income, foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. In translation, a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit (detriment) of approximately $147 million and $33 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2010 and approximately ($199) million and $4 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2009. 41 Table of Contents Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and options to partially, or entirely, hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. dollar investments. This has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $78 million and $104 million in assets, respectively. There were no instruments in a liability position at May 31, 2010 or 2009. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other (income) expense, net in the period during which the hedged available-for-sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. We estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains included in other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $34 million and $124 million on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Refer to Note 18 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. During fiscal 2008, we began to hedge certain net investment positions in Euro-functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI; concurrent with settlement, we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate. The fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at May 31, 2010 and 2009 were $32 million in assets and $23 million in liabilities, respectively. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $5 million and $191 million in the years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $3.2 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was net income of $1.9 billion as well as positive cash flows from working capital. Our working capital provided a net positive cash flow of $0.7 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to a net cash outflow of $0.4 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in cash flows from working capital 42 Table of Contents was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, driven by timing of fourth quarter expenses, a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of a shorter collection cycle and slightly lower revenues, and a decrease in inventories, reflective of tighter inventory buys compared to fiscal 2009. Cash used by investing activities was $1.3 billion during fiscal 2010, compared to $0.8 billion for fiscal 2009. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments of $0.9 billion (net of sales and maturities) in fiscal 2010 compared to $0.5 billion in net purchases of short-term investments during fiscal 2009. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase in cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2010 was a reduction in proceeds for the settlement of net investment hedges compared to the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Cash used by financing activities was $1.1 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to $0.7 billion used in fiscal 2009. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments of notes payable and long-term debt as well as an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2010, we purchased 11.3 million shares of NIKE’s Class B common stock for $754 million. During fiscal 2010, we concluded our previous four-year, $3 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2006. During this program, we repurchased a total of 53.9 million shares. Having completed the program, during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we began repurchases under the four-year $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Of the total 11 million shares repurchased during fiscal 2010, 6.6 million shares were repurchased under this program for $454 million. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2010, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 334 $ 264 $ 220 $ 177 $ 148 $ 466 $ 1,609 Long-term Debt 7 178 47 57 7 142 438 Endorsement Contracts(1) 675 638 568 508 411 990 3,790 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 2,676 — — — — — 2,676 Other(3) 267 108 114 8 3 1 501 Total $ 3,959 $ 1,188 $ 949 $ 750 $ 569 $ 1,599 $ 9,014 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for 43 Table of Contents bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2010. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2010. The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $282 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2010. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2010. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2010 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 139 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 88 As of May 31, 2010, letters of credit of $101 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In December 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which $760 million in debt securities may be issued. As of May 31, 2010, no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration. We may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal 2011 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2010, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi-year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on our current long-term 44 Table of Contents senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2010, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of May 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2011 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures required under this guidance. In February 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on subsequent events. Under this amended guidance, SEC filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements. This guidance was effective immediately and we adopted these new requirements since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification”) as the single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for all non-governmental entities. The Codification, which launched July 1, 2009, changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance. The Codification became effective for us beginning September 1, 2009. The issuance of FASB Codification did not change GAAP and therefore the adoption has only affected how specific references to GAAP literature are disclosed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents In April 2009, the FASB updated guidance related to fair value measurements to clarify the guidance related to measuring fair value in inactive markets, to modify the recognition and measurement of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities, and to require public companies to disclose the fair values of financial instruments in interim periods. This updated guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures required under the updated guidance. In June 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance applicable when determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This guidance clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or earnings per share. In April 2008, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets. The guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding business combinations, establishing principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any resulting goodwill, and any non-controlling interest in an acquiree in its financial statements. This guidance also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. This amended guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, but could impact the accounting for future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. This guidance clarifies that non-controlling interests in subsidiaries should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIE”). This new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict 47 Table of Contents future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in 48 Table of Contents which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit’s business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry, and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain resulting receivable or payable balances. When specific criteria for hedge accounting have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into 49 Table of Contents net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or when it is not probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When appropriately designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. 50 Table of Contents We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash 51 Table of Contents flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen and British Pounds. See Section “Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $17 million and $68 million at May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The VaR decreased year-over-year as a result of reduced total notional value of our foreign 52 Table of Contents currency derivative portfolio combined with decreased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2010. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $52 million and $207 million during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. We, therefore, consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2010.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our “Direct to Consumer” operations, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences. In addition to achieving long-term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: • Making our supply chain a competitive advantage through operational discipline, • Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste, • Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs, • Improving working capital efficiency, and • Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders. Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: • High single-digit revenue growth, • Mid-teens earnings per share growth, • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and • Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. 23 Table of Contents Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, NIKE, Inc’s revenues and earnings per share have grown 8% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 14% to 22% and we expanded gross margins by more than 5 percentage points. Our fiscal 2011 results demonstrated our continued focus toward meeting our financial goals, while positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable long-term growth. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2011, we delivered record high revenues and diluted earnings per share. Our revenues grew 10% to $20.9 billion, net income increased 12% to $2.1 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.39, a 14% increase from fiscal 2010. Income before income taxes increased 13% for fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The increase in revenues is reflective of increased demand for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel products across most businesses, particularly in the North America, Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies. Demand for our NIKE Brand footwear and apparel was fueled by our innovative products as well as strong category focused retail presentations. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by higher product input costs, increased transportation expenses and a lower mix of licensee revenue as certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned to NIKE, Inc. owned markets. These factors more than offset the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business and our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. Net income for fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by a year-over-year increase of 80 basis points in our effective tax rate, driven primarily by an increase in the percentage of total pre-tax income earned from operations in the United States. The United States statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside the United States. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchases during fiscal 2011. While we increased the use of working capital in fiscal 2011 to support the growth of our businesses, we returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal 2010. While we continue to believe that the Company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective, our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world. Our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions, except per share data) Revenues $ 20,862 $ 19,014 10 % $ 19,176 -1 % Cost of sales 11,354 10,214 11 % 10,572 -3 % Gross margin 9,508 8,800 8 % 8,604 2 % Gross margin % 45.6 % 46.3 % 44.9 % Demand creation expense 2,448 2,356 4 % 2,352 0 % Operating overhead expense 4,245 3,970 7 % 3,798 5 % Total selling and administrative expense 6,693 6,326 6 % 6,150 3 % % of Revenues 32.1 % 33.3 % 32.1 % Restructuring charges — — — 195 — Goodwill impairment — — — 199 — Intangible and other asset impairment — — — 202 — Income before income taxes 2,844 2,517 13 % 1,957 29 % Net income 2,133 1,907 12 % 1,487 28 % Diluted earnings per share 4.39 3.86 14 % 3.03 27 % Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges(1) Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges(1) (In millions) Revenues $ 20,862 $ 19,014 10 % 10 % $ 19,176 -1 % -2 % (1) Results have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 On both a reported and currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 10% for fiscal 2011, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. On a currency neutral basis, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 10% for fiscal 2011, while revenues for our Other Businesses increased 8%. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, every NIKE Brand geography except Japan delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2011, led by North America, which contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase. The Emerging Markets and Greater China contributed approximately 3 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. By product group, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11% and 9%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues declined 2% during fiscal 2011. Fueling the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand in our performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and Free technologies which are used across multiple categories. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2011 was attributable to a high single-digit percentage increase in unit sales along with a low single-digit percentage increase in the average selling price per pair. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Men’s Training, Action Sports and Women’s Training products, while the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases on selected products 25 Table of Contents and fewer close-outs as a percentage of total sales. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a low double-digit percentage increase in unit sales attributable to strong category presentations and improved product lines, while the average selling price per unit was relatively flat. The increase in unit sales was driven by increased demand in all key categories. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to see growth in revenue through our Direct to Consumer channels. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2011, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 16% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 15% in fiscal 2010. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 16% for fiscal 2011 as we continue to expand our store network, increase comparable store sales and build our e-commerce business. Comparable store sales grew 11% for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: the store has been open at least one year, square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Revenues for our Other Businesses consist of results from our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 8% in fiscal 2011, reflecting double-digit percentage revenue growth at Converse, Cole Haan and Hurley, and a low single-digit growth at Umbro, which more than offset a mid single-digit revenue decline at NIKE Golf. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. declined 2%, driven primarily by a 2% decline in revenues for the NIKE Brand. All of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of Emerging Markets, reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets, most notably in our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geographies. By product group, revenues for our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business were down 1% compared to the prior year. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel and equipment revenues declined 5% and 7%, respectively. Our Direct to Consumer operations represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to 13% in fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for our Other Businesses increased by 4% for fiscal 2010, driven by increased revenues at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset revenue declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. Futures Orders Futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2011 were 15% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. This futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, primarily driven by a high single-digit percentage increase in unit sales volume and a low single-digit percentage increase in average price per unit for both footwear and apparel products. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: Reported Futures OrdersGrowth Futures OrdersExcluding Currency Changes(1) North America +14 % +14 % Western Europe +11 % +1 % Central & Eastern Europe +13 % +10 % Greater China +24 % +17 % Japan -13 % -6 % Emerging Markets +25 % +23 % Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders +15 % +12 % 26 Table of Contents (1) Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advance/futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Gross Margin Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 9,508 $ 8,800 8 % $ 8,604 2 % Gross Margin % 45.6 % 46.3 % (70 ) bps 44.9 % 140 bps Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 70 basis points lower than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this decrease were as follows: • Higher input costs across most businesses, • Increased transportation costs, including additional air freight incurred to meet strong demand for NIKE Brand products across most businesses, most notably in North America, Western Europe, and Central & Eastern Europe geographies, and • A lower mix of licensee revenue as distribution for certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned from licensees to operating units of NIKE, Inc. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 130 basis points for fiscal 2011, with the most significant erosion in the second half of the fiscal year. These decreases were partially offset by the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, a higher mix of full-price sales and favorable impacts from our ongoing product cost efficiency initiatives. As we head into fiscal 2012, we anticipate that our gross margins will continue to face pressure from macroeconomic factors, most notably rising product input costs as well as higher transportation costs, which may more than offset the favorable impact from our planned price increases and ongoing production cost efficiency initiatives. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 140 basis points higher than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows: • Improved in-line product margins across most geographies, driven by reduced raw material and freight costs as well as favorable changes in product mix, 27 Table of Contents • Improved inventory positions, most notably in North America and Western Europe, which drove a shift in mix from discounted close-out to higher margin in-line sales, and • Growth of NIKE-owned retail as a percentage of total revenue, across most NIKE Brand geographies, driven by an increase in both new store openings and comparable store sales. Together, these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately 160 basis points for fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, primarily affecting our Emerging Markets and Central & Eastern Europe geographies. Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) Demand creation expense(1) $ 2,448 $ 2,356 4 % $ 2,352 0 % Operating overhead expense 4,245 3,970 7 % 3,798 5 % Selling and administrative expense $ 6,693 $ 6,326 6 % $ 6,150 3 % % of Revenues 32.1 % 33.3 % (120 ) bps 32.1 % 120 bps (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 In fiscal 2011, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling and administrative expense. Demand creation expense increased 4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased spending around key product initiatives and investments in retail product presentation with wholesale customers. Operating overhead expense increased 7% compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations as well as growth in our wholesale operations, where we incurred higher personnel costs and travel expenses as compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2010, changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense. Demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year, as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead expense increased 4% compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performance-based compensation and investments in our Direct to Consumer operations. These increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal 2010 as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2009, we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $195 million in fiscal 2009, primarily consisting of cash severance costs. These charges are included in “Corporate” for segment reporting purposes. 28 Table of Contents Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Assets Impairment In fiscal 2009, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $199 million and $202 million relating to Umbro’s goodwill, intangibles and other assets, respectively. Although Umbro’s financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition. This erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 – Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income), net Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) Other (income), net $ (33 ) $ (49 ) -33 % $ (89 ) -45 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Other (income), net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2011, other (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains. For fiscal 2011, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million on our income before income taxes. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010 and 2009, other (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains and the recognition of previously deferred licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey. For fiscal 2010, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $34 million. Income Taxes Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change Effective tax rate 25.0 % 24.2 % 80 bps 24.0 % 20 bps Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2010 due primarily to the change in geographic mix of earnings. A larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the U.S. This impact was partially offset by changes to uncertain tax positions. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of Umbro’s 29 Table of Contents goodwill, intangible and other assets. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 26.5%, 230 basis points higher than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to our international operations, as tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Operating Segments The Company’s reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any non-functional currency revenues or product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates. For all NIKE Brand operating segments, differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses generated by the Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2011 presentation, as South Africa became part of the Emerging Markets operating segment beginning June 1, 2010. Previously, South Africa was part of the Central & Eastern Europe operating segment.

(3) Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments but managed through our central foreign exchange risk 30 Table of Contents management program, and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities, which are used to record any non-functional currency revenues into the entity’s functional currency. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as “EBIT”) which represents net income before interest expense (income), net and income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. As discussed in Note 18 — Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in EBIT of our operating segments. The breakdown of earnings before interest and taxes is as follows: Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010(1) FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009(1) FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) North America $ 1,750 $ 1,538 14 % $ 1,429 8 % Western Europe 721 856 -16 % 939 -9 % Central & Eastern Europe 233 253 -8 % 394 -36 % Greater China 777 637 22 % 575 11 % Japan 114 180 -37 % 205 -12 % Emerging Markets 688 521 32 % 364 43 % Global Brand Divisions (998 ) (867 ) -15 % (811 ) -7 % Total NIKE Brand 3,285 3,118 5 % 3,095 1 % Other Businesses 334 299 12 % (193 ) — Corporate (771 ) (894 ) 14 % (955 ) 6 % Total Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 2,848 $ 2,523 13 % $ 1,947 30 % Interest expense (income), net 4 6 -33 % (10 ) — Total Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes $ 2,844 $ 2,517 13 % $ 1,957 29 % (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2011 presentation.

Contributing to the wholesale revenue growth was strong product category presentations at our wholesale customers, improved product lines and earlier shipments of summer season 31 Table of Contents products. North America’s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19%, which contributed approximately 4 percentage points to North America’s revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 14% growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North America footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Men’s and Women’s Training and Football (Soccer) categories and a single-digit percentage growth in Basketball, partially offset by a low single-digit percentage decline in sales of our NIKE Brand Sportswear products. The year-over-year increase in North America apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in most key categories, most notably Men’s Training, Running, Basketball and Women’s Training. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North America’s EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a lower gross margin percentage. The decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased air freight and product input costs, which more than offset the favorable impact from the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and fewer close-out sales. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for North America declined 1%, driven primarily by a decrease in revenue from our wholesale business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our NIKE-owned retail business, driven primarily by an increase in comparable store sales. During fiscal 2010, the decrease in North America footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a low single-digit percentage decrease in unit sales, while average selling price per pair remained flat. The decline in unit sales was primarily driven by lower sales for our Kids’ and Running categories in the first half of fiscal 2010. North America apparel revenue during fiscal 2010 was flat when compared to fiscal 2009, which was reflective of a high single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, offset by a low double-digit percentage decrease in unit sales. Both the increase in average selling price per unit and the decrease in unit sales were primarily a result of fewer close-out sales compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the increase in North America’s EBIT was primarily the result of improved gross margins combined with a slight decrease in selling and administrative expense, driven by a reduction in demand creation expense compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to a shift in mix from close-out to in-line sales, growth of our Direct to Consumer business as a percentage of total sales, improved in-line product margins and lower warehousing costs.

Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, grew 5% for fiscal 2011. Western Europe’s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 10%, which contributed approximately 1 percentage point to Western Europe’s revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 6% growth in comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 7%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Running, Football (Soccer) and Action Sports categories, which more than offset a slight revenue decline in our NIKE Brand Sportswear category. On a currency neutral basis, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Football (Soccer) and Running categories, which more than offset a mid single-digit revenue decline in our NIKE Brand Sportswear category. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Western Europe’s EBIT was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, all of which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was significantly impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates. Also contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher product input and air freight costs, higher royalty expenses related to sales of endorsed team products and higher full price discounts. These factors more than offset the favorable impact of fewer close-out sales. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 On a currency neutral basis, most markets in Western Europe experienced lower revenues during fiscal 2010, reflecting a difficult retail environment throughout the geography. Our largest market, the U.K. & Ireland, declined 4%. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the decrease in footwear revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of low single-digit decreases in both average selling price and unit sales. The decrease in average selling price was attributable to higher customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels, while the reduction in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories. The year-over-year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a high single-digit decline in unit sales combined with a mid single-digit decrease in average selling price. The decrease in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories, while the decrease in average selling price was a result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. For fiscal 2010, EBIT for Western Europe declined at a faster rate than revenues, as the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues more than offset the improvements in gross margin percentage. The increase in selling administrative expense was primarily driven by a higher level of both demand creation spending around the 2010 World Cup and operating overhead expense as a result of investments in our Direct to Consumer operations and higher performance-based compensation. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher in-line product margins, a smaller proportion of close-out sales and reduced inventory obsolescence expense as a result of our leaner inventory positions. 33 Table of Contents Central & Eastern Europe Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10 %Change FY11 vs.FY10 %ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09 %Change FY10 vs.FY09 %ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 600 $ 558 8 % 11 % $ 673 -17 % -16 % Apparel 356 354 1 % 4 % 468 -24 % -24 % Equipment 75 81 -7 % -5 % 106 -24 % -21 % Total Revenues $ 1,031 $ 993 4 % 7 % $ 1,247 -20 % -19 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 233 $ 253 -8 % $ 394 -36 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Led by Russia and Turkey, most territories within Central & Eastern Europe reported revenue growth during fiscal 2011 as economic conditions in the geography continued to show signs of recovery. The growth in Central & Eastern Europe’s footwear revenues was mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Football (Soccer), Running and Action Sports categories, while the growth in apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Running category. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Central & Eastern Europe’s EBIT was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates, higher air freight costs and an increase in product input costs. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Economic conditions in Central & Eastern Europe remained difficult as most markets within the geography experienced lower revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in footwear revenue was due to a decline in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2009. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. The year-over-year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a double-digit decrease in average selling price and a mid single-digit decline in unit sales. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels, while the decline in unit sales was due to lower sales in most key product categories. The year-over-year decrease in Central & Eastern Europe’s EBIT during fiscal 2010 was the result of lower revenues, a decline in gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expense. The decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, as well as higher discounts provided to customers. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in the reserve for bad debts along with increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations. 34 Table of Contents Greater China Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,164 $ 953 22 % 19 % $ 940 1 % 1 % Apparel 789 684 15 % 13 % 700 -2 % -3 % Equipment 107 105 2 % 0 % 103 2 % 0 % Total Revenues $ 2,060 $ 1,742 18 % 16 % $ 1,743 0 % 0 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 777 $ 637 22 % $ 575 11 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2011, driven by expansion in the number of partner-owned stores selling NIKE products, as well as improvement in comparable store sales for partner-owned stores. For fiscal 2011, the increase in Greater China’s footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in our Running and NIKE Brand Sportswear categories, while the growth in apparel revenue was mainly driven by double-digit percentage increases in our NIKE Brand Sportswear, Basketball and Men’s Training categories. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Greater China grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of a higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to higher product prices, favorable product mix and lower inventory obsolescence expense, which more than offset higher product input costs and warehousing costs from our new China distribution center. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, revenues for Greater China were flat, primarily attributable to comparisons against strong revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2009 driven by the Beijing Olympics. Greater China began to gain momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010, as revenues increased 11% as compared to the second half of fiscal 2009. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a mid single-digit increase in average selling price, partially offset by a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to strategic price increases, while the decrease in unit sales was primarily driven by lower discounts on in-line products compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a mid single-digit decrease in unit sales across most major categories, which more than offset a low single-digit increase in average selling price primarily driven by strategic price increases. EBIT for Greater China increased at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margins and reductions in demand creation spending attributable to comparisons against higher prior year spending around the Beijing Olympics. 35 Table of Contents Japan Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 396 $ 433 -9 % -16 % $ 430 1 % -7 % Apparel 302 357 -15 % -23 % 397 -10 % -17 % Equipment 68 92 -26 % -32 % 99 -7 % -13 % Total Revenues $ 766 $ 882 -13 % -21 % $ 926 -5 % -12 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 114 $ 180 -37 % $ 205 -12 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Macroeconomic conditions in Japan remain difficult. On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a major earthquake and resulting tsunami. While the Company’s organization and assets in Japan were not materially damaged, business results for the month of March 2011 were significantly eroded by the natural disaster. As we enter fiscal 2012, we anticipate macroeconomic conditions in Japan to remain difficult as consumer confidence continues to recover. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined, driven by decreases across most key categories. Partially offsetting the decreases was a double-digit percentage growth in revenues from Running apparel. The decrease in Japan’s EBIT for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by an improvement in the gross margin percentage. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable year-over-year standard currency rates and positive impacts from fewer discounts on close-out sales, which more than offset higher product input costs and inventory obsolescence expense. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined during fiscal 2010 due to decreases in unit sales across most major categories. The decline in revenues was reflective of a difficult and highly promotional marketplace in Japan. For fiscal 2010, the decrease in Japan’s EBIT was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense, driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, which more than offset improved gross margins. 36 Table of Contents Emerging Markets Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,897 $ 1,458 30 % 24 % $ 1,185 23 % 20 % Apparel 657 577 14 % 9 % 477 21 % 17 % Equipment 182 164 11 % 6 % 166 -1 % -3 % Total Revenues $ 2,736 $ 2,199 24 % 19 % $ 1,828 20 % 17 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 688 $ 521 32 % $ 364 43 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Emerging Markets increased 19% for fiscal 2011. Most territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year, led by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Korea. For fiscal 2011, both footwear and apparel revenue growth in the Emerging Markets was primarily driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, most notably NIKE Brand Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Emerging Markets grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a higher mix of in-line product sales, lower warehousing costs and favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, which more than offset the increase in product input costs and higher full-price discounts. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2010 revenue growth for the Emerging Markets geography was driven by growth in all product categories and all territories, most notably Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Footwear revenue growth was primarily driven by a double-digit growth in unit sales and a mid single-digit increase in average selling price per pair during fiscal 2010, reflective of strong demand for most NIKE Brand product categories in all markets within the geography. For fiscal 2010, the increase in Emerging Markets’ EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth combined with lower selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to lower operating overhead expense resulting from fiscal 2009 restructuring activities. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable year-over-year standard currency rates compared to the prior year, which more than offset improved in-line product margins. 37 Table of Contents Global Brand Divisions Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues $ 123 $ 105 17 % 21 % $ 96 9 % 12 % (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes (998 ) (867 ) -15 % (811 ) -7 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Revenues for the Global Brand Divisions are attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the increase in Global Brand Division expense was primarily due to an increase in both operating overhead and centrally managed demand creation expense. The increase in operating overhead expense was mainly driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer infrastructure along with higher wages and travel expense. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased investments in sports marketing. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in Global Brand Division expense was largely due to increases in centrally managed demand creation expense and performance-based compensation, which more than offset an increase in licensing revenues. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by the centralization of certain marketing production costs.

The revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in China, as 38 Table of Contents well as increased sales in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to a Converse owned distribution model. Revenues for Cole Haan increased 12%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as high single-digit percentage growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. Revenues declined at NIKE Golf, where we experienced significant erosion in our Japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for our Other Businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues, primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts. The gross margin percentage remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011, as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in Other Businesses’ revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset the declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. In fiscal 2009, EBIT for our Other Businesses included a $401 million pre-tax non-cash charge relating to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro. Excluding this impairment charge, EBIT for our Other Businesses would have increased 43%, as a result of higher revenues, improved gross margins across most businesses, and lower demand creation spending. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 — Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) Revenues $ 11 $ (25 ) — $ — — (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes (771 ) (894 ) 14 % (955 ) 6 % Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters, unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses, corporate eliminations and other items. Corporate revenues primarily consist of (1) foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program and (2) foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities, which are used to record any non-functional currency revenues into the entity’s functional currency. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, other conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to each entity in NIKE Brand geographic operating segments, which are used to record any non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses, generated by the Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. 39 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Corporate expense was primarily driven by year-over-year net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Also contributing to the decrease in Corporate expense for fiscal 2011 was a $54 million year-over-year reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year. These benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses, primarily driven by higher wage-related expense. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2009, results for Corporate included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $195 million. Excluding this restructuring charge, loss before interest and taxes for Corporate would have increased by 18% for fiscal 2010, primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the U.S., in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions, such as sales, purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non-functional currencies, and the translation into U.S. dollars of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our foreign currency exposures are due primarily to U.S. dollar transactions at wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the majority of the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements, the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis, to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. on a consolidated basis. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical, by hedging a portion of certain remaining material exposures, using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Transactional exposures We transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, both of which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: 1. Inventory Purchases — Most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. This generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. A weaker U.S. dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiary’s functional currency whereas a stronger U.S. dollar increases the inventory cost. 2. Non-Functional Currency Revenues — A portion of our Western Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound), but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency, generating foreign currency exposure. 3. Other Revenues and Costs — Non-functional currency revenues and costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other payments, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. 40 Table of Contents 4. Non-Functional Currency Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in other (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. As of May 31, 2011, we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 15 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including non-functional currency revenues and expenses. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2011 and 2010 was $28 million and $206 million in assets and $136 million and $25 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”), a component of shareholders’ equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. In these cases, the change in value of the instruments is immediately recognized in other (income), net and is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency asset or liability being hedged. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2011 and 2010 was $9 million and $104 million in assets and $17 million and $140 million in liabilities, respectively. Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Translational exposures Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders’ equity. In preparing our consolidated statements of income, foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. In translation, a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit (detriment) of approximately ($28) million and ($16) million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2011 and approximately $147 million and $33 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2010. Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and options to partially, or entirely, hedge the variability of 41 Table of Contents the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. dollar investments. This has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2011 was $1 million in assets and $21 million in liabilities. At May 31, 2010, the fair value was $78 million in assets. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other (income), net in the period during which the hedged available-for-sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. We estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net had net (detriment) benefit on our income before income taxes of approximately $(33) million and $34 million for the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010. Refer to Note 17 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We hedge certain net investment positions in Euro-functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI; concurrent with settlement, we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate. The fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at May 31, 2011 was $23 million in liabilities. At May 31, 2010, the fair value was $32 million in assets. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled ($23) million and $5 million in the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to $3.2 billion for fiscal 2010. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2011 was net income of $2.1 billion. Our working capital was a net cash outflow of $708 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to a positive net cash inflow of $694 million for fiscal 2010. Our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and higher accounts receivable. Inventory at the end of fiscal 2011 increased 33% compared to fiscal 2010, primarily driven by a 15% increase in futures orders, growth in replenishment programs for high-turnover styles, early purchases of key seasonal items with longer production lead times as well as the growth of Direct to Consumer operations. Changes in currency exchange rates and higher product costs also contributed to the increase in dollar inventory. The increase in accounts receivable was mainly attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal 2011. Cash used by investing activities was $1.0 billion during fiscal 2011, compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2010. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower net purchases of short-term investments. Net purchases of short-term investments were $537 million (net of sales and maturities) in fiscal 2011 compared to $937 million during fiscal 2010. 42 Table of Contents Cash used by financing activities was $2.0 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to $1.1 billion used in fiscal 2010. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in notes payable. In fiscal 2011, we purchased 23.8 million shares of NIKE’s class B common stock for $1.9 billion. These repurchases were made under the four-year, $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors which commenced in December 2009 and as of the end of fiscal 2011, we have repurchased 30.4 million shares for $2.3 billion under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2011, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 374 $ 310 $ 253 $ 198 $ 174 $ 535 $ 1,844 Long-term Debt 200 48 58 8 109 37 460 Endorsement Contracts(1) 800 806 742 615 463 1,018 4,444 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 3,175 — — — — — 3,175 Other(3) 277 137 22 4 1 — 441 Total $ 4,826 $ 1,301 $ 1,075 $ 825 $ 747 $ 1,590 $ 10,364 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are 43 Table of Contents enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2011. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2011. The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $212 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2011. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2011. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2011 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 187 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 111 As of May 31, 2011, letters of credit of $99 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In December 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which $760 million in debt securities may be issued. As of May 31, 2011, no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2011, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi-year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on our current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2011, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. As of May 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaling $4.5 billion, including amounts held in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations and government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio is less than 120 days as of May 31, 2011. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where it is needed. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIE”). This new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 45 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders’ equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations. In April 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. 46 Table of Contents In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level 47 Table of Contents of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit’s business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of 48 Table of Contents the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry, and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedge probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income), net during the quarter in which such changes occur. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our 49 Table of Contents common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential 50 Table of Contents actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income), net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen and British Pounds. See Section “Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes 51 Table of Contents and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $33 million and $17 million at May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year primarily as a result of increased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2011. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $79 million and $52 million during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. We, therefore, consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. 52 Table of Contents Details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2011.

320187,NKE,"NIKE, Inc.",2012,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells high quality footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our “Direct to Consumer” operations, and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives, worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and service businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online. In addition to achieving long-term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: • Expanding gross margin by: – Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, – Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation, – Utilizing price increases to effectively manage the price-to-value equation for our customers. • Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs, • Improving working capital efficiency, and • Deploying capital effectively. Through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals continue to be: • High-single-digit revenue growth, • Mid-teens earnings per share growth, • Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and • Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, NIKE, Inc.’s revenues and earnings per share have grown 9% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 15% to 22% and we expanded gross margins by 4 percentage points. Our fiscal 2012 results demonstrated our continued focus toward delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders, while positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable long-term growth. Despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2012. Our revenues grew 16% to $24.1 billion, net income increased 4% to $2.2 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.73, an 8% increase from fiscal 2011. Income before income taxes increased 5% for fiscal 2012, driven by revenue growth and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin and an increase in other expense. The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies, key categories and product types. Brand strength, innovative products and strong category retail presentation continues to fuel the demand for our NIKE Brand products. During fiscal 2012, we introduced a number of innovations, including the NIKE Fuelband and the Flyknit technology. The NIKE Fuelband is a digital device that tracks one’s daily activities through a sport-tested accelerometer, while Flyknit is a new footwear technology that uses advanced materials and proprietary manufacturing technology to produce a form-fitting, lightweight and seamless upper. During this time, we also expanded our NIKE + platform into our Basketball and Training categories, and launched new high performance uniforms for all 32 NFL teams. Revenue for our Other Businesses also grew, reflective of growth across most businesses, led by Converse. Our gross margin continued to be impacted by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, which more than offset the positive impacts of higher product selling prices, the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and benefits from ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. For fiscal 2012, the growth of our net income was negatively affected by a year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate. However, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 3% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding, driven by share repurchases during fiscal 2012 and 2011. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the Company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand, and with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. For additional details, refer to our “Other Businesses” section below. While we will continue to face headwinds from higher input costs and foreign exchange volatility in fiscal 2013, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term, by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.

(3) References to NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the overall current NIKE Brand market footprint on a wholesale revenue basis. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1) sales to external wholesale customers and 2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues do not include the estimation of sales made by NIKE Brand licensees as the amounts are not material. (4) Others include all other categories and certain adjustments that are not allocated at the category level. 17 Table of Contents Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 On a currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 14% for fiscal 2012, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 15%, as every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012. North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase, while the Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. Revenues for our Other Businesses grew 11% during fiscal 2012, contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15% and 13%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 16% during fiscal 2012. Continuing to fuel the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and FREE technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to double-digit percentage growth in unit sales along with a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair, primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, notably Running, Sportswear and Basketball. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by mid-single-digit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices. The increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases, partially offset by a higher mix of close-out sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to see growth in revenue through our Direct to Consumer channels. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2012, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 17% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16% in fiscal 2011. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 21% for fiscal 2012, as comparable store sales grew 13% and we continue to expand our store network and e-commerce business. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: the store has been open at least one year, square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Revenues for our Other Businesses consist of results from our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 11% in fiscal 2012, reflecting growth across all businesses except Hurley, which was slightly down for the fiscal year. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 On both a reported and currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 10% for fiscal 2011, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. On a currency neutral basis, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 10% for fiscal 2011, while revenues for our Other Businesses increased 8%. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, every NIKE Brand geography except Japan delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2011, led by North America, which contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase. The Emerging Markets and Greater China contributed approximately 3 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. By product group, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 12% and 10%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues declined 2% during fiscal 2011. Fueling the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand in our performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and Free technologies. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2011 was attributable to a high-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales along with a low single-digit percentage increase in the average selling price per pair. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Men’s Training, Action Sports and Women’s Training products, while the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases on selected products and fewer close-outs as a percentage of total sales. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage increase in unit sales attributable to strong category presentations and improved product lines, while the average selling price per unit was relatively flat. The increase in unit sales was driven by increased demand in all key categories. For fiscal 2011, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 16% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 15% in fiscal 2010. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 16% for fiscal 2011 as we continue to expand our store network, increase comparable store sales and build our e-commerce business. Comparable store sales grew 11% for fiscal 2011. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for Other Businesses increased by 8% in fiscal 2011, reflecting double-digit percentage revenue growth at Converse, Cole Haan and Hurley, and a low-single-digit growth at Umbro, which more than offset a mid-single-digit revenue decline at NIKE Golf. Futures Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2012 were 7% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. The U.S. Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, as unit orders and average selling price per unit each contributed approximately 6 percentage points of growth. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: Reported FuturesOrders Growth Futures Orders ExcludingCurrency Changes(1) North America 15 % 15 % Western Europe -2 % 8 % Central & Eastern Europe 5 % 11 % Greater China 5 % 2 % Japan -6 % 1 % Emerging Markets 10 % 20 % Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders 7 % 12 % (1) Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 18 Table of Contents The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders, and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including at-once and close-out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Gross Margin (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11% Change Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs. FY10% Change Gross Profit $ 10,471 $ 9,508 10 % $ 8,800 8 % Gross Margin % 43.4 % 45.6 % (220 ) bps 46.3 % (70 ) bps Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period, primarily driven by higher product input costs, including materials and labor, across most businesses. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges, discounts on close-out sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points. Partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases, lower air freight costs, the growth of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 70 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by higher input costs, transportation costs, including additional air freight incurred to meet strong demand for NIKE Brand products across most businesses, and a lower mix of licensee revenue as distribution for certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned from licensees to operating units of NIKE, Inc. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 130 basis points for fiscal 2011, with the most significant erosion in the second half of the fiscal year. These decreases were partially offset by the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, a higher mix of full-price sales and favorable impacts from our ongoing product cost efficiency initiatives. Selling and Administrative Expense (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11% Change Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs. FY10% Change Demand creation expense(1) $ 2,711 $ 2,448 11 % $ 2,356 4 % Operating overhead expense 4,720 4,245 11 % 3,970 7 % Selling and administrative expense $ 7,431 $ 6,693 11 % $ 6,326 6 % % of Revenues 30.8 % 32.1 % (130 ) bps 33.3 % (120 ) bps (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Overall, selling and administrative expense grew at a slower rate than revenues for fiscal 2012. Demand creation expense increased 11% compared to the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, marketing support for key product initiatives, including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL uniforms, as well as an increased level of brand event spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point. Compared to the prior year, operating overhead expense increased 11%, primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business. For fiscal 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of operating overhead expense by 1 percentage point. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 In fiscal 2011, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling and administrative expense. Demand creation expense increased 4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased spending around key product initiatives and investments in retail product presentation with wholesale customers. Operating overhead expense increased 7% compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations as well as growth in our wholesale operations, where we incurred higher personnel costs and travel expenses as compared to the prior year. Other Expense (Income), net (In millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Other expense (income), net $ 54 $ (33 ) $ (49 ) 19 Table of Contents Other expense (income), net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, other expense, net increased $87 million compared to the prior year. This change was primarily driven by a $76 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year. These impacts, together with a $24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of NIKE Brand’s Western Europe operations, were partially offset by certain net gains related to non-operating items. The combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense (income), net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, other expense (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains. For fiscal 2011, we estimated that the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million on our income before income taxes. Income Taxes Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11% Change Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs. FY10% Change Effective tax rate 25.5 % 25.0 % 50 bps 24.2 % 80 bps Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 50 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax position. This impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the United States as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 primarily due to the change in geographic mix of earnings. A larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the U.S. This impact was partially offset by changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions. Operating Segments The Company’s reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses. These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established.

Our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers, driving demand for NIKE Brand products across all seven key categories. North America’s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19% for fiscal 2012, fueled by 15% growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2012, footwear revenue in North America increased 15%, driven by an increase in both unit sales and average selling prices. Unit sales rose at a double-digit rate while average selling price per pair grew at a mid-single-digit rate, reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in all key categories, most notably Running, Basketball, Women’s Training and Sportswear. Compared to the prior year, apparel revenue for North America increased 18%, primarily driven by a low-double-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in unit sales. The increase in average selling price per unit was reflective of product price increases and a greater mix of higher price point products. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, including Men’s Training, Running and Basketball. For fiscal 2012, EBIT for North America increased 16% as revenue growth and improved selling and administrative expense leverage more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points during fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product input costs and lower gross margins on close-out sales, which more than offset the favorable impact of selling price increases, lower air freight costs and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 70 basis points for fiscal 2012, as both demand creation and operating overhead expense grew at a slower rate than revenues. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues for North America increased 13%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in both wholesale and Direct to Consumer revenues. Contributing to the wholesale revenue growth was strong product category presentations at our wholesale customers, improved product lines and earlier shipments of summer season products. North America’s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19%, which contributed approximately 4 percentage points to North America’s revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 14% growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North America footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Men’s and Women’s Training and Football (Soccer) and a single-digit percentage growth in Basketball, partially offset by a low-single-digit percentage decline in sales of our NIKE Brand Sportswear products. The year-over-year increase in North America apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in most key categories, most notably Men’s Training, Running, Basketball and Women’s Training. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North America’s EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a lower gross margin percentage. The decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased air freight and product input costs, which more than offset the favorable impact from the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and fewer close-out sales.

Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, declined 3% for the fiscal 2012 period. Western Europe’s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 18% for fiscal 2012, including 8% growth in comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 5% for fiscal 2012, primarily driven by a low-single-digit percentage growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair, primarily reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in Running, Basketball and Football (Soccer), which more than offset a decline in Action Sports. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2% for fiscal 2012. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a mid-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, reflective of higher product prices. Partially offsetting the increase in average selling price per unit was a mid-single-digit percentage decline in unit sales. The overall increase in apparel sales was driven by growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a decline in Sportswear. On a reported basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 7% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 18%, primarily driven by a 350 basis point decline in gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The decline in gross margin was driven by higher product input costs and the negative impact from changes in standard currency rates, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases and the growth of our Direct to Consumer business. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by an increased level of demand creation spending around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Also reflected in Western Europe’s fiscal 2012 results was a $24 million charge relating to the restructuring of its operations. 22 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 On a currency neutral basis, revenues for Western Europe increased 6% for fiscal 2011, attributable to growth in most territories. Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, grew 5% for fiscal 2011. Western Europe’s Direct to Consumer revenues grew 10%, which contributed approximately 1 percentage point to Western Europe’s revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 6% growth in comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 8%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running, Football (Soccer) and Action Sports, which more than offset a slight revenue decline in Sportswear. On a currency neutral basis, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 4%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Football (Soccer) and Running, which more than offset a mid-single-digit revenue decline in Sportswear. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Western Europe’s EBIT was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, all of which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was significantly impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates. Also contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher product input and air freight costs, higher royalty expenses related to sales of endorsed team products and higher full price discounts. These factors more than offset the favorable impact of fewer close-out sales.

Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central & Eastern Europe’s footwear revenue grew 13%, primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a low-single-digit percentage increase in average selling price per pair. The increase in average selling price per pair was reflective of product price increases which more than offset the negative impact of higher discounts on in-line and close-out sales. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories, most notably Running, Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Central & Eastern Europe’s apparel revenues grew 24%, mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales, offset by a slight decrease in average price per unit, mainly due to less favorable product mix and higher discounts on in-line sales, which more than offset the impact from product price increases. The overall increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in Football (Soccer), Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, revenues for Central & Eastern Europe increased 15% for fiscal 2012. However, EBIT fell 4%, primarily driven by a 420 basis point decline in gross margin. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to higher product input costs as well as higher discounts on in-line and close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact from product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat compared to the prior period. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Led by Russia and Turkey, most territories within Central & Eastern Europe reported revenue growth during fiscal 2011 as economic conditions in the geography continued to show signs of recovery. The growth in Central & Eastern Europe’s footwear revenues was mainly driven by double-digit percentage growth in Football (Soccer), Running and Action Sports, while the growth in apparel revenues was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Central & Eastern Europe’s EBIT was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to unfavorable year-over-year standard currency rates, higher air freight costs and an increase in product input costs.

Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater China’s footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and a mid-single-digit growth in average unit price per pair, reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by double-digit percentage growth across most key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the growth in Greater China’s apparel revenues for fiscal 2012 was mainly driven by a high-single-digit growth in the average selling price per unit and a low-single-digit percentage increase in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was reflective of product price increases, partially offset by higher discounts on in-line and close-out products to accelerate the sales of slower moving apparel inventories. On a reported basis, revenues for Greater China increased 23% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 17%, as revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in gross margin and an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. Gross margin decreased 150 basis points for fiscal 2012, primarily attributable to higher product input costs and discounts on close-out products, which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, driven by an increase in operating overhead expense. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2011, driven by expansion in the number of partner-owned stores selling NIKE products, as well as improvement in comparable store sales for partner-owned stores. For fiscal 2011, the increase in Greater China’s footwear revenue was primarily driven by double-digit percentage growth in Running and Sportswear, while the growth in apparel revenue was mainly driven by double-digit percentage increases in Sportswear, Basketball and Men’s Training. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Greater China grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of a higher gross margin, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher product prices, favorable product mix and lower inventory obsolescence expense, which more than offset higher product input costs and warehousing costs from our new China distribution center.

On a currency neutral basis, footwear revenue in Japan increased 3% for fiscal 2012, as growth in Running and Football (Soccer) more than offset a decline in Sportswear. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, apparel revenue decreased 1% for fiscal 2012, as the decline in Sportswear more than offset the growth in Running and Football (Soccer). On a reported basis, EBIT for Japan grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of improved gross margin and leverage of selling and administrative expenses. The increase in Japan’s gross margin was mainly driven by the favorable impact from the year-over-year change in standard currency rates, a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense as well as a lower mix of close-out sales. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher product input costs. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a major earthquake and resulting tsunami. While the Company’s organization and assets in Japan were not materially damaged, business results for the month of March 2011 were significantly eroded by the natural disaster. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined, driven by decreases across most key categories. Partially offsetting the decreases was double-digit percentage growth in revenues from Running apparel. The decrease in Japan’s EBIT for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by an improvement in the gross margin percentage. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable year-over-year standard currency rates and positive impacts from fewer discounts on close-out sales, which more than offset higher product input costs and inventory obsolescence expense. 24 Table of Contents Emerging Markets (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11% Change FY12 vs. FY11% Change ExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs. FY10% Change FY11 vs. FY10 % ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Revenues by: Footwear $ 2,386 $ 1,897 26 % 27 % $ 1,458 30 % 24 % Apparel 815 657 24 % 25 % 577 14 % 9 % Equipment 209 182 15 % 15 % 163 12 % 7 % TOTAL REVENUES $ 3,410 $ 2,736 25 % 26 % $ 2,198 24 % 19 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $ 853 $ 688 24 % $ 521 32 % Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for the Emerging Markets increased 26% for fiscal 2012 as all territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth, led by Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea. For fiscal 2012, revenue growth for both footwear and apparel in the Emerging Markets was driven by double-digit percentage growth in unit sales and mid-single-digit percentage growth in average selling price per unit, primarily reflective of product price increases. The overall increase in Emerging Markets’ footwear and apparel sales was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, led by Running and Sportswear. The increase in Emerging Markets’ EBIT for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage, which more than offset a lower gross margin. Gross margin declined 150 basis points for the fiscal year, primarily due to higher product input costs, customs duty charges and inventory obsolescence expense. These factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in standard currency exchange rates and product price increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 140 basis points, as both demand creation expense and operating overhead grew at a slower rate than revenues. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Emerging Markets increased 19% for fiscal 2011. Most territories in the geography reported double-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year, led by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Korea. For fiscal 2011, both footwear and apparel revenue growth in the Emerging Markets was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Emerging Markets grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a higher mix of in-line product sales, lower warehousing costs and favorable year-over-year standard currency rates, which more than offset the increase in product input costs and higher full-price discounts.

Revenues for the Global Brand Divisions are attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, Global Brand Divisions’ loss before interest and taxes increased $206 million, primarily driven by increased investments in our digital business and infrastructure for our Direct to Consumer operations, higher sports marketing expense as well as higher personnel costs to support our global brand functions. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the increase in Global Brand Divisions’ loss before interest and taxes was primarily due to an increase in both operating overhead and centrally managed demand creation expense. The increase in operating overhead expense was mainly driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer infrastructure along with higher wages and travel expense. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased investments in sports marketing. 25 Table of Contents Other Businesses (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11% Change FY12 vs. FY11 %ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs. FY10% Change FY11 vs. FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Revenues Converse $ 1,324 $ 1,131 17 % 17 % $ 983 15 % 15 % NIKE Golf 726 658 10 % 9 % 670 -2 % -3 % Cole Haan 535 521 3 % 3 % 466 12 % 12 % Hurley 248 252 -2 % -1 % 222 14 % 13 % Umbro 262 224 17 % 14 % 223 0 % 2 % TOTAL REVENUES $ 3,095 $ 2,786 11 % 11 % $ 2,564 9 % 8 % EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES $ 341 $ 335 2 % $ 298 12 % Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Our Other Businesses are comprised of our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. For fiscal 2012, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 11%, reflecting growth across most businesses, led by Converse. The revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased sales in North America and China, as well as increased revenues in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to direct distribution in the second half of fiscal 2011. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE Golf increased 9% for fiscal 2012, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our apparel business, partially offset by a single-digit percentage decline in our club business. On a currency neutral basis, revenues for Umbro grew 14% primarily driven by sales growth in France due to our acquisition of the exclusive licensee and distributor in March 2011. For fiscal 2012, revenues for Cole Haan grew 3%, mostly driven by growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. On a reported basis, revenues for our Other Businesses increased 11% for fiscal 2012, while EBIT grew 2%, as earnings growth at Converse was mostly offset by losses at Umbro and Hurley. Higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues negatively affected profitability at both companies, while lower gross margins also contributed to the decline in Hurley’s earnings. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the Company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand, and with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses, which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE, Jordan, Converse and Hurley brands. For fiscal 2012 and 2011, Cole Haan and Umbro combined contributed $797 million and $745 million, respectively, in revenues to the Other Businesses portfolio, and losses before interest and taxes of $43 million and $18 million, respectively. We are currently in the process of preparing these businesses for sale and identifying suitable buyers. Although we are unable to estimate the ultimate gains or losses on the sales of these businesses at this time, we anticipate we will in the future incur certain non-cash charges related to the divestiture of Umbro. Upon the sale of the business, or when the ultimate selling price becomes estimable, we expect to incur non-cash charges to liquidate certain balance sheet accounts, most significantly the cumulative translation adjustment and deferred tax assets related to Umbro. At May 31, 2012, the cumulative translation adjustment was $110 million, net of tax, and the deferred tax asset was $32 million. We may also incur other cash and non-cash charges related to the divestiture of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in China, as well as increased sales in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to direct distribution. Revenues for Cole Haan increased 12%, driven by double-digit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as high-single-digit percentage growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. Revenues declined at NIKE Golf, where we experienced significant erosion in our Japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for our Other Businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues, primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts. Gross margin remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011, as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011. Corporate (Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs. FY11% Change Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs. FY10% Change Revenues $ (39 ) $ (69 ) — $ 7 — (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes (916 ) (805 ) -14 % (841 ) 4 % Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses; corporate eliminations and other items. Corporate revenues primarily consist of certain intercompany revenue eliminations and foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Other Businesses but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, other conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Other Businesses. 26 Table of Contents Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, Corporate expense grew $111 million, mainly due to an increase of $49 million in performance-based compensation and a year-over-year net increase of $73 million from foreign currency impacts. These foreign currency impacts were driven by a year-over-year increase in foreign currency net losses, arising from certain Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign currency hedges and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various non-functional currencies, net of related undesignated forward instruments, as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. Dollar year-over-year. The above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Corporate expense was primarily driven by year-over-year net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Also contributing to the decrease in Corporate expense for fiscal 2011 was a $54 million year-over-year reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year. These benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses, primarily driven by higher wage-related expense. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows, such as the Euro and Chinese Renminbi, into U.S. Dollars. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio, and where practical, by hedging a portion of the remaining material exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk on a portfolio basis by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of aggregate foreign exchange exposure. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Transactional exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: • Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: 1. Non-functional currency denominated product purchases: a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”), a wholly-owned centralized sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from external factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from external factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. 2. Factory input costs: In January 2012, NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated. For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivatives and are recorded at fair value through other expense (income), net. Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail. As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost. • Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound, Polish Zloty) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure. • Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. • Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, which may create fluctuations in other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. 27 Table of Contents Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product costs exposure as discussed below. As of May 31, 2012, there were outstanding currency forward contracts with maturities up to 24 months. The fair value of outstanding currency forward contracts at May 31, 2012 and 2011 was $183 million and $28 million in assets and $32 million and $136 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”), a component of shareholders’ equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect consolidated earnings. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. The fair value of undesignated instruments was $55 million and $9 million in assets and $20 million and $17 million in liabilities at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 – Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded. Translational exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders’ equity. In the translation of our consolidated statements of income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $268 million and $(28) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit (detriment) of approximately $74 million and $(16) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2012 and 2011 was $27 million and $1 million in assets and $3 million and $21 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other expense (income), net in the period during which the hedged available-for-sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. The combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense (income), net had an insignificant impact on our income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2012 and had a unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million for the year ended May 31, 2011. Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We hedge certain net investment positions in Euro-functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense (income), net. The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2012. At May 31, 2011, the fair value was $23 million in liabilities. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $22 million and $(23) million for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 28 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.9 billion for fiscal 2012 compared to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2012 was net income of $2.2 billion. Our working capital was a net cash outflow of $799 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to a net cash outflow of $708 million for fiscal 2011. Our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses. Inventory at the end of fiscal 2012 increased 23% compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher product input costs as well as changes in product mix, which more than offset the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Inventory units for the NIKE Brand grew 10% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in futures orders and improved factory deliveries. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily driven by higher prepaid demand creation expenses around the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics. Cash provided by investing activities was $514 million during fiscal 2012, compared to a use of cash of $1,021 million for fiscal 2011. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $1,124 million (net of purchases) in fiscal 2012, compared to net purchases of $537 million (net of sales and maturities) during fiscal 2011. Cash used by financing activities was $2.1 billion for fiscal 2012 compared to $2.0 billion for fiscal 2011. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to higher payments of long-term debt, notes payable, and dividends, which was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2012, we purchased 20.0 million shares of NIKE’s class B common stock for $1.8 billion. These repurchases were made under the four-year, $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008, under which stock repurchase activities commenced in December 2009. As of the end of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 50.3 million shares for $4.1 billion under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and/or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Capital Resources On November 1, 2011, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billon with lender approval. The facility matures in November 2016, with a one-year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date, provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1, 2018. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion committed credit facility agreement that would have expired in December 2012. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, we had no amounts outstanding under our new committed revolving credit facility. We currently have long-term debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed revolving credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2012, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2013 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively. Our previous $760 million shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission expired during fiscal 2012. No debt securities were issued under that shelf registration prior to its expiry. We may issue debt securities under a new shelf registration in fiscal 2013 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio is less than 120 days as of May 31, 2012. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided. We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. Should we require additional capital in the U.S., we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the U.S. through debt. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. If we elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt, we would incur additional interest expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2012 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, (In millions) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Operating Leases $ 408 $ 387 $ 271 $ 224 $ 186 $ 662 $ 2,138 Long-term Debt 49 59 9 109 9 27 262 Endorsement Contracts(1) 856 804 686 491 363 628 3,828 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 2,861 — — — — — 2,861 Other(3) 320 101 38 31 91 1 582 TOTAL $ 4,494 $ 1,351 $ 1,004 $ 855 $ 649 $ 1,318 $ 9,671 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2012. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2012. The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $285 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2012. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long-term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2012. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below. (In millions) Outstanding as of May 31, 2012 Notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 108 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 75 As of May 31, 2012, letters of credit of $138 million were outstanding, which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which became effective for us beginning March 1, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which became effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards became effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 30 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2013. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. We do not expect the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders’ equity. Companies will now be required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This guidance also required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. However, in December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. Both issuances on the presentation of comprehensive income are effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers, and estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. 31 Table of Contents Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value if any. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit’s business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. On May 31, 2012, we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses. As of May 31, 2012, Cole Haan had no goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet, while Umbro had $70 million of goodwill and $164 million of trademark and other intangible assets. As of May 31, 2012, both asset groups for Cole Haan and Umbro did not quality as “assets-held-for-sale” under applicable accounting guidance. The decision to divest these businesses was deemed a triggering event to perform an impairment analysis of Umbro’s intangible assets at that date and was considered in our fourth quarter impairment analysis. We are currently in the process of preparing the businesses for divestiture and identifying potential acquirers. Therefore, we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of the Umbro reporting unit because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis. As discussed above, the asset groups for Umbro did not qualify as “assets-held-for-sale”; therefore, we did not consider potential disposition costs or cumulative translation adjustments in the carrying value of the Umbro reporting unit in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter impairment analysis. Because we are still in the preliminary stages of the divestiture process and have not yet identified potential acquirers or the likely deal structure, these methods represent our best estimate of the fair value of the Umbro business. Our analysis determined there was no impairment of intangible assets or goodwill related to Umbro. If the sales process indicates a fair value that is below the current carrying value of the reporting unit, an analysis would be required to determine if impairment charges exist at that point. 32 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds, U.S. agency securities and money market funds. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include an analysis of period-over-period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non-functional monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other expense (income), net during the quarter in which such changes occur. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 33 Table of Contents Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other expense (income), net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. See section “Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices” under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $21 million and $33 million at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The VaR decreased year-over-year primarily as a result of decreased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2012. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $87 million and $79 million during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2012. 35 Table of Contents Expected Maturity Date Year Ending May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Fair Value Foreign Exchange Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 27 $ 72 $ 76 Average interest rate 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % Interest Rate Risk Japanese Yen Functional Currency Long-term Japanese Yen debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 9 $ 27 $ 72 $ 76 Average interest rate 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % U.S. Dollar Functional Currency Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate swapped to Floating rate Principal payments $ 40 $ — $ — $ 100 $ — $ — $ 140 $ 154 Average interest rate 0.8 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.7 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.7 % Long-term U.S. Dollar debt — Fixed rate Principal payments $ — $ 50 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 50 $ 53 Average interest rate 0.0 % 4.7 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 4.7 % The fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.
