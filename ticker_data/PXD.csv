Pioneer is a holding company whose assets consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and whose business is conducted substantially through, its subsidiaries. Pioneer's common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE.The Company is a Delaware corporation formed in 1997. The Company's executive offices are located at 5205 N. O'Connor Blvd., Suite 200, Irving, Texas 75039. The Company's telephone number is (972) 444-9001. The Company maintains other offices in Anchorage, Alaska; Denver, Colorado and Midland, Texas. At December 31, 2012, the Company had 3,667 employees, 2,484 of whom were employed in field and plant operations.Available InformationPioneer files or furnishes annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""). The public may read and copy any materials that Pioneer files with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including Pioneer, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that Pioneer files with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.The Company also makes available free of charge through its internet website (www.pxd.com) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.Mission and StrategiesThe Company's mission is to enhance shareholder investment returns through strategies that maximize Pioneer's long-term profitability and net asset value. The strategies employed to achieve this mission are predicated on maintaining financial flexibility, capital allocation discipline and enhancing net asset value through accretive drilling programs, joint ventures and acquisitions. These strategies are anchored by the Company's interests in the long-lived Spraberry oil field; the liquid-rich Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale Combo, Hugoton and West Panhandle fields; and the Raton gas field; which together have an estimated remaining productive life in excess of 40 years. Underlying these fields are 94 percent of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2012.Business ActivitiesThe Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Pioneer's purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for, develop and produce oil and gas reserves. In so doing, the Company sells homogenous oil, NGL and gas units that, except for geographic and relatively minor quality differences, cannot be significantly differentiated from units offered for sale by the Company's competitors. Competitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas exploration and development industry by employing well-trained and experienced personnel who make prudent capital investment decisions based on management direction, embrace technological innovation and are focused on price and cost management.Petroleum industry. While oil and NGL prices generally improved from 2009 through 2011, during 2012, oil and NGL production growth in the United States outpaced demand growth causing prices to become more volatile and decline during the year. North American gas prices have remained volatile and have generally trended lower since 2009. The decline in North American gas prices is primarily a result of growing gas supplies associated with discoveries of significant gas reserves in United States shale plays, combined with the warmer than normal recent winters, which has resulted in gas storage levels being at historically high levels, and minimal economic demand growth in the United States. Oil prices continue to be primarily driven by world supply and demand fundamentals; however, recent increases in United States oil, NGL and gas production volumes from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Marcellus areas have been met with lower demand, higher storage levels and pipeline, gas plant and NGL fractionation infrastructure capacity limitations, which has led to a reduction in United States NYMEX oil, NGL and gas prices compared to international prices for similar commodities, including Brent oil prices. 6Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYDuring 2010, 2011 and 2012, the economies in the United States and certain other countries stabilized with resulting improvements in industrial demand and consumer confidence. However, other economies, such as those of certain European and Asian nations, continue to face economic struggles or slowing economic growth. While the outlook for a continued worldwide economic recovery remains cautiously optimistic, it is still uncertain; therefore, the sustainability of the recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company believes it is likely that commodity prices will continue to be volatile during 2013.Significant factors that will affect 2013 commodity prices include: the ongoing effect of economic stimulus initiatives; fiscal challenges facing the United States federal government and potential changes to the tax laws in the United States; continuing economic struggles in European and Asian nations; political and economic developments in North Africa and the Middle East; demand from Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (""OPEC"") and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas; and overall North American NGL and gas supply and demand fundamentals.Pioneer uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value. Although the Company has entered into commodity derivative contracts for a large portion of its forecasted production through 2014, a sustained lower commodity price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which the Company could enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future. As a result, the Company's internal cash flows would be reduced for affected periods. A sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows, which could negatively affect the Company's liquidity, financial position and future results of operations.

North American oil prices have been fairly consistent during the past three years despite the significant increase in United States oil production from unconventional shale plays. The growth in North American oil production has been offset by reduced oil imports, keeping supply and demand fairly balanced. Continued oil production growth in United States from unconventional shale plays is expected to outpace the decline in oil imports and increase oil price volatility. The growth of unconventional shale drilling has also substantially increased the supply of NGLs, resulting in a significant decline in NGL component prices as the supply of such products has grown. While more export facilities have been built and NGL exports are increasing, the overall United States demand for NGL products has not kept pace with the remaining supply of such products; consequently, prices for NGL products have generally declined over the past three years. North American gas prices have remained 6Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYvolatile and they trended lower from 2009 through 2012, but improved steadily throughout 2013. The decline in North American gas prices was primarily a result of significant discoveries of gas and associated gas reserves in United States gas, oil and liquid-rich shale plays, combined with the warmer than normal recent winters, which resulted in gas storage levels being at historically high levels, and minimal economic demand growth in the United States. The increases in gas prices during 2013 were primarily related to reduced drilling activity in gas shale plays and demand increases in the latter part of the year as a result of colder weather. Oil prices continue to be primarily driven by world supply and demand fundamentals; however, recent increases in United States oil, NGL and gas production volumes from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Marcellus areas have been met with lower demand, higher storage levels and pipeline, gas plant and NGL fractionation infrastructure capacity limitations, which has led to a reduction in United States NYMEX oil, NGL and gas prices compared to international prices for similar commodities, including Brent oil prices.

North American oil prices had been fairly stable during the past three years despite the significant increase in United States oil production from unconventional shale plays. During such time, the growth in North American oil production had been offset by reduced oil imports, keeping supply and demand fairly balanced in the United States. On an international level, the geopolitical factors negatively impacting international oil supplies were offset by the decline in United States imports, resulting in generally stable world oil prices. During the second half of 2014, however, as United States production continued to surge, worldwide demand was sluggish, reflecting the decline in the Chinese growth rate, the lingering recession in Europe and weaker economic performance in other regions, resulting in a worldwide oversupply of oil and oil price weakness. During the fourth quarter of 2014, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (""OPEC"") decided to maintain production quotas at current levels despite production outpacing demand. This caused oil prices, which had already been declining, to decrease significantly in December 2014. The market oversupply of oil is expected to continue in 2015, with oil prices expected to remain under pressure. The growth of unconventional shale drilling has also substantially increased the supply of NGLs, resulting 6Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYin a significant decline in NGL component prices as the supply of such products has grown. While more export facilities have been built and NGL exports are increasing, the overall United States demand for NGL products has not kept pace with the supply of such products; consequently, prices for NGL products have generally declined over the past three years. North American gas prices have remained volatile and they trended lower from 2009 through 2012, but improved steadily throughout 2013 and 2014 before dropping significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline in North American gas prices from 2009 through 2012 was primarily a result of significant discoveries of gas and associated gas reserves in United States gas, oil and liquid-rich shale plays, combined with the warmer than normal winters, which resulted in gas storage levels being at historically high levels, and minimal economic demand growth in the United States. The increases in gas prices during the latter part of 2013 and the majority of 2014 were primarily related to reduced drilling activity in gas shale plays and demand increases as a result of colder late 2013 and early 2014 winter weather, which reduced storage levels. The recent gas price decrease during the fourth quarter of 2014 reflects expectations for a warmer than normal winter, which is expected to result in gas storage levels being higher than normal at the end of the winter draw season and an expectation that there will be an oversupply of gas during 2015. Oil prices continue to be primarily driven by world supply and demand fundamentals. Recent increases in United States oil, NGL and gas production volumes from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Marcellus and Utica areas have been met with lower demand, the decades-old ban on oil exports, higher storage levels and pipeline, gas plant and NGL fractionation infrastructure capacity limitations. These factors have led to a reduction in United States NYMEX oil, NGL and gas prices compared to international prices for similar commodities, including Brent oil prices. Since 2010, the economies in the United States and certain other countries have continued to stabilize with resulting improvements in industrial demand and consumer confidence. However, other economies, such as those of certain European and Asian nations, continue to face economic struggles or slowing economic growth. While the outlook for a continued worldwide economic recovery remains cautiously optimistic, its timing and strength is still uncertain; therefore, the likelihood of a sustained recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company believes it is likely that commodity prices will continue to be volatile during 2015.Significant factors that will affect 2015 commodity prices include: the impact of announced capital spending decreases on forecasted United States oil, NGL and gas supplies; the ongoing effect of economic stimulus initiatives; fiscal challenges facing the United States federal government and potential changes to the tax laws in the United States; continuing economic struggles in European and Asian nations; political and economic developments in North Africa and the Middle East; demand from Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas; the capacity of United States refiners to absorb increasing domestic supplies of oil and condensate; potential export regulatory changes in the United States; the supply and demand fundamentals for NGLs in the United States and the pace at which export capacity grows; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including gas storage levels that are anticipated to be higher than normal at the end of the winter draw season.Pioneer uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value.

The strategies employed to achieve this mission are predicated on maintaining financial flexibility, capital allocation discipline and enhancing net asset value through accretive drilling programs, joint ventures and acquisition and divestiture activities. These strategies are primarily anchored by the Company's interests in the long-lived Spraberry/Wolfcamp oil field located in West Texas, which has an estimated remaining productive life in excess of 40 years. Underlying the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field is 70 percent of the Company's total proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2015. Complementing this growth area, the Company has oil and gas production activities and development and exploration opportunities in the following areas:•the liquid-rich Eagle Ford Shale play located in South Texas;•the Raton gas field located in southern Colorado;•the West Panhandle gas and liquids field located in the Texas Panhandle; and•the Edwards gas field located in South Texas.Business ActivitiesThe Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

Until the middle of 2014, North American oil prices had been fairly stable despite the significant increase in United States oil production from unconventional shale plays. During such time, the growth in North American oil production had been offset by reduced oil imports, keeping supply and demand fairly balanced in the United States. On an international level, the geopolitical factors negatively impacting international oil supplies were offset by the decline in exports to 6Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYthe United States, resulting in generally stable world oil prices. During the second half of 2014, however, as United States production continued to surge, worldwide demand was sluggish, reflecting the decline in the Chinese growth rate, the lingering recession in Europe and weaker economic performance in other regions, resulting in a worldwide oversupply of oil and oil price weakness. During the fourth quarter of 2014, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (""OPEC"") decided to maintain production quotas at current levels despite production outpacing demand. This caused oil prices, which had already been declining, to decrease significantly in December 2014. The market oversupply of oil continued in 2015, resulting in further declines in oil prices, and the supply of oil in 2016 is expected to continue to outpace demand growth, with worldwide storage levels continuing to increase. With major world producers expecting to continue producing at current levels and the re-introduction of Iranian supplies previously subject to international sanctions, oil prices are expected to remain under pressure during 2016. The growth of unconventional shale drilling has also substantially increased the supply of NGLs, resulting in a significant decline in NGL component prices as the supply of such products has grown. While more export facilities have been built and NGL exports are increasing, the overall United States demand for NGL products has not kept pace with the supply of such products; consequently, prices for NGL products have generally declined over the past three years. NGL product supplies are expected to remain at elevated levels during 2016, which is expected to keep NGL prices under pressure during 2016.The decline in North American gas prices from 2009 through 2012 was primarily a result of significant discoveries of gas and associated gas reserves in United States gas, oil and liquid-rich shale plays, combined with minimal economic demand growth in the United States. The increases in gas prices during the latter part of 2013 and the first nine months of 2014 were primarily related to reduced drilling activity in gas shale plays coupled with demand increases associated with colder winter weather, which resulted in reduced gas storage levels during 2014. Gas prices began decreasing in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continued to decline throughout 2015 and into 2016 as a result of supply increases and warmer than normal winter weather, which has resulted in gas storage levels being at historical highs. The current oversupply of gas is expected to continue during 2016. Oil prices continue to be primarily driven by world supply and demand fundamentals. Recent increases in United States oil, NGL and gas production volumes from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Marcellus and Utica areas have been met with lower demand, higher storage levels and pipeline, gas plant and NGL fractionation infrastructure capacity limitations. These factors led to a reduction during 2015 in United States NYMEX oil, NGL and gas prices compared to international prices for similar commodities, including Brent oil prices, although United States and international prices have recently converged as a result of the lifting of the United States oil export ban in December 2015. Since 2010, the United States economy, along with the economies of a few other countries, has generally been stable, achieving modest improvements in industrial demand and consumer confidence. However, other economies, such as those of certain European and Asian nations, continue to face economic struggles or slowing economic growth. Consequently, the worldwide economy has remained sluggish despite multiple stimulus packages being enacted by various governments. The outlook for a worldwide economic recovery remains uncertain; therefore, the likelihood of a sustained recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company believes it is likely that commodity prices will continue to be volatile during 2016.Significant factors that will affect 2016 commodity prices include: the impact of announced capital spending decreases on forecasted United States oil, NGL and gas supplies; the ongoing effect of economic stimulus initiatives; fiscal challenges facing the United States federal government and potential changes to the tax laws in the United States; continuing economic struggles in European and Asian nations; political and economic developments in North Africa and the Middle East; demand from Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations are willing or able to manage oil supply through export quotas; the supply and demand fundamentals for NGLs in the United States and the pace at which export capacity grows; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including gas storage levels that are anticipated to be higher than normal at the end of the winter draw season.Pioneer uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value. Although the Company has entered into commodity derivative contracts for a large portion of its forecasted production through 2016, the lower commodity price environment has resulted in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and a reduction in the prices at which the Company is able to enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future. As a result, the Company's internal cash flows have been negatively impacted by the reduction in commodity prices and are expected to continue to be impacted until commodity prices improve. If commodity prices remain at current levels or decline further, the Company could experience a shortfall in expected future cash flows, which could negatively affect the Company's liquidity, financial position and future results of operations.

The Company's long-term growth strategy is centered around the following strategic objectives:•maintaining a strong balance sheet to ensure financial flexibility; •delivering economic production and reserve growth; •enhancing drilling, completion and production activities by utilizing the Company's scale and technology advancements to reduce costs and improve efficiency; and •developing and training employees and contractors to perform their jobs in a safe manner, combined with environmental stewardship through industry-leading sustainable development efforts. These strategies are primarily anchored by the Company's interests in the long-lived Spraberry/Wolfcamp oil field located in West Texas, which has an estimated remaining productive life in excess of 40 years. Underlying the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field is over 75 percent of the Company's total proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2016. Complementing this growth area, the Company has oil and gas production activities and development and exploration opportunities in the following areas:•the liquid-rich Eagle Ford Shale play located in South Texas;•the Raton gas field located in southern Colorado;•the West Panhandle gas and liquids field located in the Texas Panhandle; and•the Edwards gas field located in South Texas.Business ActivitiesPioneer's purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for, develop and produce oil and gas reserves.

The Company's portfolio of resources 6Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYand opportunities are diversified among oil, NGL and gas, and are well balanced among long-lived, dependable production and lower-risk exploration and development opportunities. Petroleum industry. The industry has been operating in a low oil price environment since late 2014, when North American oil prices began declining due to a worldwide oversupply of oil. During the fourth quarter of 2016, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (""OPEC"") agreed to reduce their output by approximately 1.2 million BOEPD and certain oil-producing nations outside of OPEC, including Russia, agreed to an additional 600,000 BOEPD reduction in production. These combined output reductions represent an unprecedented level of cooperation among oil-producing countries and the announcement of the reductions has resulted in a nominal increase in oil prices. In 2017, the worldwide supply of oil is expected to decline and, as a result, oil prices are expected to gradually increase as the supply reductions are realized and worldwide oil inventory levels decline. Enforcement of the agreed production cuts will be monitored closely, and the Company expects ongoing oil price volatility as compliance with the output reduction agreement is reported. The growth of unconventional shale drilling in the United States has substantially increased the supply of gas and NGLs, resulting in a significant decline in related prices as the supply of these products has grown. While the industry has invested in initiatives designed to increase takeaway capacity, such as the construction of liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") and NGL export facilities, the supply of these products has exceeded the overall United States and international demand for these commodities. NGL products and gas supplies are expected to remain at consistent levels during 2017, which is expected to keep prices relatively flat during 2017.Significant factors that are likely to affect 2017 commodity prices include: the effect of new policies enacted by a new President of the United States and his administration; fiscal challenges facing the United States federal government; potential changes to the tax laws in the United States; continuing economic struggles in European and Asian nations; political and economic developments in North Africa and the Middle East; demand from Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations adhere to and agree to extend the agreed oil production cuts, which expire in June 2017; the supply and demand fundamentals for NGLs in the United States and the pace at which export capacity grows; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including incremental LNG export capacity additions and the pace that gas storage is refilled during the year given that gas storage levels are anticipated to be normal at the end of the winter draw season.Pioneer uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value.

Petroleum industry. The petroleum industry has been operating in a lower oil price environment since late 2014, when North American oil prices began declining due to a worldwide oversupply of oil. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (""OPEC"") members and some nonmembers, led by Russia, pledged to reduce their oil output by roughly 1.8 million barrels a day from October 2016 levels in an effort to draw down a global oversupply and to rebalance supply and demand. The agreement became effective in January 2017 and was originally set to expire in March 2018. During November 2017, OPEC members and some nonmembers agreed to lengthen the output reductions through December 2018. These output reductions represented an unprecedented level of cooperation among oil-producing countries and, coupled with healthy oil demand, resulted in an increase in oil prices during 2017. In 2018, the worldwide demand for oil is expected to increase further as economic growth around the world is forecasted to be stronger than the last several years. This demand increase is expected to be met by higher supplies of oil from U.S. shale production growth and further oil inventory drawdowns. The Company expects ongoing oil price volatility as compliance with the output reduction agreement, changes in oil inventories and actual demand growth is reported.The growth of unconventional shale drilling in the United States has substantially increased the supply of gas and NGLs, resulting in a significant decline in related prices as the supply of these products has grown. While the industry has invested in initiatives designed to increase takeaway capacity, such as the construction of liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") and NGL export facilities, the supply of these products has exceeded the overall United States and international demand for these commodities. NGL products and gas supplies are expected to increase during 2018, which is expected to cause prices to decline slightly or remain flat during 2018.Significant factors that are likely to affect 2018 commodity prices include: the effect of new policies enacted by the President of the United States and his administration; fiscal challenges facing the United States federal government; enacted changes to the tax laws in the United States; expected economic growth throughout the world; political and economic developments in North Africa and the Middle East; forecasted increased demand from Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations adhere to and agree to extend the agreed oil production cuts, which expire in December 2018; the supply and demand fundamentals for NGLs in the United States and the pace at which export capacity grows; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including incremental LNG export capacity additions and the pace that gas storage is refilled during the year given that gas storage levels are anticipated to be at normal levels at the end of the winter draw season.Pioneer uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value. The Company has entered into commodity derivative contracts for a large portion of its forecasted production for 2018 and, to a lesser extent, its forecasted 2019 production; however, commodity prices are volatile and if commodity prices decline, the Company could realize lower prices for unprotected volumes and could see a reduction in the prices at which the Company is able to enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future. As a result, the Company's internal cash flows will be negatively impacted by a reduction in commodity prices. See ""Item 7A.

The Company's portfolio of resources and opportunities are primarily located in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp oil field, and provide long-lived, dependable production and lower-risk exploration and development opportunities. Petroleum industry. Over the past several years, the oil price environment has been characterized by high volatility. During 2018, Brent oil prices rose to a high of $86.29 per barrel in early October 2018, only to fall late in the fourth quarter to a low of $50.47 per barrel due to concerns over a worldwide oversupply of oil, in large part resulting from dramatic increases in U.S. shale oil production. Additionally, concerns about the potential for slower growth in U.S. and global gross domestic products, which would likely be accompanied by lower oil demand, has contributed to the downward pressure. Recently, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (""OPEC"") members and some nonmembers, including Russia, have renewed pledges to reduce planned production in an effort to draw down a global oversupply and to rebalance supply and demand. Geopolitical factors may also be price-supportive, with the United States having issued sanctions against Iran, although the impact of those sanctions has been muted by waivers. The Company expects ongoing oil price volatility as compliance with the output reduction agreements, changes in oil inventories, extensions to Iranian waivers and actual demand growth is reported.The growth of unconventional shale drilling in the United States has substantially increased the supply of gas and NGLs, resulting in a significant decline in related prices as the supply of these products has grown. While the industry has invested in initiatives designed to increase takeaway capacity, such as the construction of liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") and NGL export facilities, the supply of these products has increased at a faster pace than the overall United States and international demand for these commodities. NGL products and gas supplies are expected to continue to increase during 2019 and prices are expected to remain volatile.Significant factors that are likely to affect 2019 commodity prices include: the effect of U.S. energy, monetary and trade policies; fiscal challenges facing the United States federal government; the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and throughout the world, including the potential for macro weakness; geopolitical and economic developments in the U.S. and globally; the extent to which members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations adhere to and agree to extend the agreed oil production cuts; the supply and demand fundamentals for NGLs in the United States and the pace at which export capacity grows; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including incremental LNG export capacity additions. Because the global economic and political outlook and commodity price environment are uncertain, the Company endeavors to maintain a strong financial liquidity position to support its financial flexibility.Pioneer enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company's areas of production with the objective of transporting a portion of the Company's oil and gas sales to higher priced markets. Specifically, the Company has entered into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to diversify a portion of the Company's oil sales to the Gulf Coast refinery or international export markets and to satisfy unused gas pipeline capacity commitments. These marketing activities provided incremental cash flow of $458 million in 2018, compared to cash outlays of $31 million and $64 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally the Company uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value. The Company has entered into derivative contracts for only a small portion of its forecasted 2019 production; consequently, if commodity prices decline, the Company could realize lower prices for volumes not protected by the Company's derivative activities and could see a reduction in derivative contract prices available on additional volumes in the future. As a result, the Company's internal cash flows will be negatively impacted by a reduction in commodity prices or to the extent that sales prices do not cover the third-party purchase price and cost of transportation for that portion of volumes transported to other markets.

During 2019, Brent oil prices rose to a high of $74.57 per barrel in April 2019, up from a low of $54.91 per barrel in early January 2019. During 2020 to date, Brent oil prices declined to a low of $49.45 in February 2020. Significant factors that are likely to affect 2020 commodity prices include: the effect of U.S. energy, monetary, environmental and trade policies, including 6Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYpolicies related to U.S. and China trade negotiations and Iranian oil sanctions; fiscal challenges facing the United States federal government; the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and throughout the world; geopolitical issues globally, especially in the Middle East; the extent to which Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (""OPEC"") members and some nonmembers, including Russia, adhere to and agree to extend their oil production quota's; uncertain demand fundamentals in 2020 and beyond, led by rising oil consumption in China and India offset by European Union members reshaping their fossil fuel consumption towards lower carbon energy; overall North American and worldwide gas supply and demand fundamentals, including the timing of incremental LNG export capacity additions; and global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the recent coronavirus, which may reduce demand for oil, NGL and gas because of reduced global or national economic activity. Because the global economic and political outlook and commodity price environment are uncertain, the Company endeavors to maintain a strong financial liquidity position to provide financial flexibility should commodity prices decline and remain low for an extended period of time.While the industry has invested in initiatives designed to increase oil, NGL and gas takeaway capacity associated with growing U.S. shale production, such as the construction of additional oil and NGL export facilities and new liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") facilities, the supply of these products has increased at a faster pace than the overall U.S. and international demand for these commodities. Oil, NGL products and gas supplies are expected to continue to increase during 2020 and prices are expected to remain volatile. To mitigate this risk, Pioneer enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company's area of production with the objective of transporting a significant portion of the Company's oil and gas sales to higher priced markets. Specifically, the Company has entered into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to diversify a portion of the Company's oil and gas sales to Gulf Coast refineries and LNG facilities, international export markets and to satisfy unused gas pipeline capacity commitments. These marketing activities provided incremental cash flow of $283 million in 2019 and $458 million in 2018, compared to cash outlays of $31 million in 2017.

CompetitionThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, marketing of oil, NGL and gas production, the obtaining of equipment and services and the hiring and retention of staff necessary for the identification, evaluation, operation and acquisition and development of oil and gas properties. The Company's competitors include a large number of companies, including major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and individuals engaged in the exploration for and development of oil and gas properties. The Company also faces competition from companies that supply alternative sources of energy, such as wind, solar power, and other renewables. Competition will increase as alternative energy technology becomes more reliable and governments throughout the world support or mandate the use of such alternative energy. 6Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYCompetitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas exploration and development industry by employing well-trained and experienced personnel who make prudent capital investment decisions based on management direction, embrace technological innovation and are focused on price and cost management. The Company has a team of dedicated employees who represent the professional disciplines and sciences that the Company believes are necessary to allow Pioneer to maximize the long-term profitability and net asset value inherent in its physical assets. See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors - The Company faces significant competition and some of its competitors have resources in excess of the Company's available resources"" for additional information.Impact of the COVID-19 PandemicA novel strain of the coronavirus (""COVID-19"") surfaced in late 2019 and has spread around the world, including to the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures and other restrictions that have disrupted the demand for oil throughout the world and when combined with pressures on the global supply-demand balance for oil and related products, resulted in significant volatility in oil prices beginning in late February 2020. The length of this demand disruption is unknown, and will ultimately depend on various factors beyond the Company's control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic, the length and severity of the worldwide economic downturn, the ability of OPEC, Russia and other oil producing nations to manage the global oil supply, additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, and the time necessary to balance oil supply and demand. Additionally, there is significant uncertainty regarding the lasting impacts of the pandemic on global demand, as it cannot be predicted as to whether certain demand-reducing behaviors such as declines in business travel and changes in work-from-home practices will persist beyond the resolution of the pandemic. In response to these developments the Company has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its employees, operations and financial position. These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:Employee Health and Safety. The Company has taken steps to keep its employees safe in light of the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing preventative measures and developing response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and infection among its employees, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the ""CDC""). The Company has also modified certain business practices (including those related to non-operational employee work locations, such as a significant reduction in business travel and physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the CDC, and other governmental and regulatory authorities.Expense Management. With the reduction in revenue associated with lower oil prices during 2020, the Company focused its efforts on:•Optimizing drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, resulting in lower well costs and operating costs and•Reducing general and administrative and other overhead related costs through:◦a corporate restructuring to reduce the Company's staffing levels to correspond with a planned reduction in future activity levels, resulting in approximately 300 employees being involuntarily separated from the Company in October 2020 (the ""2020 Corporate Restructuring"");◦voluntary salary reductions by the Company's officers and board of directors from March 2020 through December 2020;◦reductions in 2020 cash incentive compensation;◦2020 benefit reductions; and ◦other cash cost reductions.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity. During 2020, the Company also took the following actions to strengthen its financial position and increase liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic:•Reduced its 2020 capital budget by over 50 percent,•Enhanced its liquidity position by refinancing a portion of its existing debt and issuing new debt, with the combined objective of increasing liquidity, extending the Company's debt maturities and lowering the Company's future cash interest expense on long-term debt, and•Adjusted the Company's derivative positions to reduce the effects of oil price volatility on its net cash provided by operating activities.The Company continues to assess the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and may modify its plans as the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 continue to evolve.7Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYSee Note 5 and Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in """,2023-12-30 21:38:49.483992

Risk Factors - The Company faces significant competition and some of its competitors have resources in excess of the Company's available resources"" for additional information.Impact of the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a severe worldwide economic downturn, significantly disrupting the demand for oil throughout the world, and created significant volatility, uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry. The decrease in demand for oil, combined with pressures on the global supply-demand balance for oil and related products, resulted in oil prices declining significantly in late February 2020. Since mid-2020, oil prices have improved, with demand steadily increasing despite the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 variants, which have continued to inhibit a full global demand recovery. In addition, worldwide oil inventories are, from a historical perspective, very low and supply increases from OPEC, Russia and other oil producing nations are not expected to be sufficient to meet forecasted oil demand growth in 2022 and 2023, with many OPEC countries not able to produce at their OPEC agreed upon quota levels due to their lack of capital investments over the past few years in developing incremental oil supplies. Global oil price levels will ultimately depend on various factors and consequences beyond the Company's control, such as (i) the effectiveness of responses to combat the COVID-19 virus and their impact on domestic and worldwide demand, (ii) the ability of OPEC, Russia and other oil producing nations to manage the global oil supply, (iii) the timing and supply impact of any Iranian sanction relief on Iran's ability to export oil, (iv) additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, (v) the global supply chain constraints associated with manufacturing delays, and (vi) political stability of oil consuming countries.The Company continues to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and may modify its response as the impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve.See ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for additional information.Acquisition and Divestiture ActivitiesAcquisitions. The Company regularly seeks to acquire or trade acreage that complements its operations, provides exploration and development opportunities, increases the lateral length of future horizontal wells and provides superior returns on investment (including acquisitions of particular oil and gas assets or entities owning oil and gas assets and mergers, consolidations or other business combinations with such entities). The Company periodically evaluates and pursues acquisition and acreage trade opportunities and at any given time may be in various stages of evaluating such opportunities. Such stages may take the form of internal financial analyses, oil and gas reserve analyses, due diligence, the submission of indications of interest, preliminary negotiations, negotiations of letters of intent or negotiations of definitive agreements. The success of any acquisition or acreage trade is uncertain and depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside the Company's control.On May 4, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Double Eagle III Midco 1 LLC (""DoublePoint"") in exchange for 27 million shares of Pioneer common stock representing stock consideration transferred of $4.2 billion, $1 billion of cash and the assumption of $890 million of debt (the ""DoublePoint Acquisition""). The DoublePoint Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with the fair value of the acquisition consideration allocated to the acquisition date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The results of operations attributable to the assets acquired in the DoublePoint Acquisition were included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning in May 2021. On January 12, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Parsley Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation that previously traded on the NYSE under the symbol ""PE"" (""Parsley""), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 20, 2020, among Pioneer, certain of its subsidiaries, Parsley and Parsley's subsidiary, Parsley Energy, LLC (the ""Parsley Acquisition""). As part of the Parsley Acquisition, each eligible share of Parsley Class A common stock and each membership interest unit of Parsley Energy, LLC were automatically converted into the right to receive 0.1252 (the ""Exchange Ratio"") shares of Pioneer common stock. As a result, the Company issued 52 million shares of Pioneer common stock upon the consummation of the Parsley Acquisition, representing total stock consideration transferred of $6.9 billion. The Parsley Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with the fair value of the acquisition consideration allocated to the acquisition date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The results of operations attributable to the assets acquired in the Parsley Acquisition were included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning on January 12, 2021.See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in """,2023-12-30 21:38:55.663826

See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors - The Company faces significant competition and some of its competitors have resources in excess of the Company's available resources."" for additional information.Oil and Gas Industry ConsiderationsThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a severe worldwide economic downturn, significantly disrupting the demand for oil throughout the world, and created significant volatility, uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry. The decrease in demand for oil, combined with excess supply of oil and related products, resulted in oil prices declining significantly beginning in late February 2020. Since mid-2020, oil prices have improved, with demand steadily increasing despite the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 variants, and related responses by governments worldwide with regards to travel restrictions, business closures and other restrictions, which have continued to inhibit a full global demand recovery. In addition, worldwide oil inventories, from a historical perspective, remain low and concerns exist with the ability of OPEC and other oil producing nations to meet forecasted future oil demand growth, with many OPEC countries not able to produce at their OPEC agreed upon quota levels due to their limited capital investments directed towards developing incremental oil supplies over the past few years. Furthermore, sanctions, import bans and price caps on Russia have been implemented by various countries in response to the war in Ukraine, further impacting global oil supply. As a result of these and other oil and gas supply constraints, the world has experienced significant increases in energy costs. During December 2022, OPEC announced a continuation of its 2 MMBOPD production cut that started in November 2022 related to the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and future oil demand. As a result of the current global supply and demand imbalances, oil and gas prices have remained strong with average NYMEX oil and NYMEX gas prices for the three months ended December 31, 2022 being $82.64 per Bbl and $6.26 per Mcf, respectively, as compared to $77.19 per Bbl and $5.84 per Mcf, respectively, for the same period in 2021. In addition, the ongoing pandemic, combined with the Russia/Ukraine conflict, has resulted in global supply chain disruptions, which has led to significant cost inflation and the potential for a global recession. Specifically, the Company's 2022 capital program was impacted by higher than expected inflation in steel, diesel and chemical prices, among other items. Global oil price levels and inflationary pressures will ultimately depend on various factors that are beyond the Company's control, such as (i) the ability of OPEC and other oil producing nations to manage the global oil supply, (ii) the impact of sanctions and import bans on production from Russia, (iii) the timing and supply impact of any Iranian sanction relief on their ability to export oil, (iv) the effectiveness of responses by businesses and governments to combat any additional outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus and their impact on domestic and worldwide demand, (v) the global supply chain constraints associated with manufacturing and distribution delays, (vi) oilfield service demand and cost inflation, (vii) political stability of oil consuming countries and (viii) increasing expectations that the world may be heading into a global recession. The Company continues to assess and monitor the impact of these factors and consequences on the Company and its operations.See ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for additional information.Divestiture ActivitiesThe Company regularly reviews its asset base to identify nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities, create organizational and operational efficiencies and further the Company's objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet to ensure financial flexibility.In February 2022, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in certain gas gathering and processing systems in northern Martin County for cash proceeds of $125 million (the ""Martin County Gas Processing Divestiture""). The sale was treated as a recovery of investment from a partial sale of proved property resulting in no gain or loss being recognized.See Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in """,2023-12-30 21:38:58.475769

Business General Pioneer is a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE. The Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production company with current operations in the United States, South Africa and Tunisia. Pioneer is a holding company whose assets consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and whose business is conducted substantially through, its subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are located at 5205 N. O’Connor Blvd., Suite 200, Irving, Texas 75039. The Company’s telephone number is (972) 444-9001. The Company maintains other offices in Anchorage, Alaska; Denver, Colorado; Midland, Texas; London, England; Capetown, South Africa and Tunis, Tunisia. At December 31, 2009, the Company had 1,888 employees, 1,151 of whom were employed in field and plant operations. Available Information Pioneer files or furnishes annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The public may read and copy any materials that Pioneer files with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including Pioneer, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that Pioneer files with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The Company also makes available free of charge through its internet website (www.pxd.com) its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. Mission and Strategies The Company’s mission is to enhance shareholder investment returns through strategies that maximize Pioneer’s long-term profitability, net asset value and net asset value per share. The strategies employed to achieve this mission are predicated on maintaining financial flexibility and capital allocation discipline while enhancing net asset value per share through accretive drilling programs, acquisitions, debt reduction, dividend distributions and share repurchases. These strategies are anchored by the Company’s long-lived Spraberry oil field and Hugoton, Raton and West Panhandle gas fields, which have an estimated remaining productive life in excess of 40 years. Underlying these fields are approximately 88 percent of the Company’s proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2009. Business Activities The Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Pioneer’s purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for, develop and produce oil and gas reserves. In so doing, the Company sells homogenous oil, NGL and gas units that, except for geographic and relatively minor quality differences, cannot be significantly differentiated from units offered for sale by the Company’s competitors. Competitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas exploration and development industry by employing well-trained experienced personnel who make prudent capital investment decisions, embrace technological innovation and are focused on price and cost management. Petroleum industry. Beginning in the second half of 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, the United States and other industrialized countries experienced a significant economic slowdown, which led to a substantial decline in worldwide energy demand. During this same time period, North American gas supply increased as a result of the rise in domestic unconventional gas production. The combination of lower energy demand due to the economic slowdown and higher North American gas supply resulted in significant declines in oil, NGL and gas prices. While oil and NGL prices started to steadily improve beginning in the second quarter of 2009, gas prices remained volatile throughout 2009 due to high storage levels and increasing gas supply. The outlook for a worldwide economic recovery in 2010 remains uncertain and, therefore, the timing of a recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict. As a result, it is likely that commodity prices during 2010 will continue to be volatile. 5 Table of Contents For the several years preceding the 2008 economic slowdown, the petroleum industry had generally been characterized by volatile but upward-trending oil, NGL and gas commodity prices. During that period, world oil prices increased in response to increases in demand from developing economies and the perceived threat of supply disruptions in the Middle East, Nigeria, Venezuela and other areas. In 2007 and the first half of 2008, oil prices increased due to supply uncertainty surrounding Middle East conflicts and increasing world demand for both oil and refined products. A significant increase in refinery outages led to tightness in products markets, which was responsible for oil price strength throughout much of 2007 and the early part of 2008. North American gas prices increased during the first half of 2008 as a result of reduced inventory levels and a perceived shortage of North American gas supply and an anticipation that the United States would become a larger importer of LNG, which was selling at a substantial premium to United States gas prices in the world market. However, by mid-year 2008 it became increasingly apparent that the capital investment in gas drilling and discoveries of significant gas reserves in United States’ shale plays would be more than sufficient to meet the Unites States demand. Coupled with the economic slowdown experienced in the second half of 2008, the increased supply of gas resulted in a sharp decline in North American gas prices. Significant factors that the Company expects to impact 2010 commodity prices include: the effect of economic stimulus initiatives being implemented in the United States and worldwide in response to the worldwide economic slowdown; developments in the issues affecting the Middle East in general; demand of Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals. To mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value, Pioneer utilizes commodity derivative contracts. Although the Company has entered into derivative contracts on a large portion of its forecasted production through 2012, a sustained lower commodity price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which the Company could enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future. As a result, the Company’s internally-generated cash flows would be reduced for affected periods. Significant or extended price declines could also adversely affect the amount of oil, NGL and gas that the Company can produce economically. The duration, timing and magnitude of any period of lower commodity prices cannot be predicted. A sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows, which could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity, financial position and future results of operations.

Mission and Strategies The Company’s mission is to enhance shareholder investment returns through strategies that maximize Pioneer’s long-term profitability and net asset value. The strategies employed to achieve this mission are predicated on maintaining financial flexibility, capital allocation discipline and enhancing net asset value through accretive drilling programs, joint ventures and acquisitions. These strategies are anchored by the Company’s interests in long-lived Spraberry oil field; the liquid-rich Eagle Ford, Barnett Shale Combo, Hugoton and West Panhandle fields; and the Raton gas field; which together have an estimated remaining productive life in excess of 40 years. Underlying these fields are approximately 90 percent of the Company’s proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2010. Business Activities The Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Pioneer’s purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for, develop and produce oil and gas reserves. In so doing, the Company sells homogenous oil, NGL and gas units that, except for geographic and relatively minor quality differences, cannot be significantly differentiated from units offered for sale by the Company’s competitors. Competitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas exploration and development industry by employing well-trained and experienced personnel who make prudent capital investment decisions based on management direction, embrace technological innovation and are focused on price and cost management. Petroleum industry. For several years preceding 2008, the petroleum industry was generally characterized by volatile, but upward trending, oil, NGL and gas commodity prices. During the first half of 2008, North American gas prices increased as a result of reduced inventory levels, a perceived shortage of North American gas supply and anticipation that the United States would become a larger importer of LNG, which was then selling in the world market at a substantial premium to United States gas prices. However, by mid-year 2008, it became apparent that capital investments in gas drilling and discoveries of significant gas reserves in United States shale plays would cause domestic gas supply to exceed existing United States gas demand. Beginning in the second half of 2008 and continuing throughout most of 2009, the United States and other industrialized countries experienced a significant economic slowdown, which 6 Table of Contents led to a substantial decline in worldwide energy demand. Declining energy demand due to the economic slowdown, together with the increased supply of United States gas, resulted in sharp declines in oil, NGL and North American gas prices during the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009. During the second half of 2009 and throughout 2010, economic stimulus initiatives implemented in the United States and worldwide served to stabilize economies and increase industry and consumer confidence. While oil and NGL prices have steadily improved since the beginning of the second quarter of 2009, gas prices have remained volatile throughout 2009 and 2010 as a result of increased gas supply and growing storage levels in the United States, which has offset the growth in demand. The outlook for continuation of the worldwide economic recovery in 2011 is cautiously optimistic but remains uncertain; therefore, the sustainability of the recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company believes it is likely that commodity prices, especially North American gas prices, will continue to be volatile during 2011. Significant factors that will impact 2011 commodity prices include: the ongoing impact of economic stimulus initiatives in the United States and worldwide in response to the worldwide economic decline; political and economic developments in North Africa and the Middle East; demand of Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals. Pioneer uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value. Although the Company has entered into derivative contracts on a large portion of its forecasted production through 2014, a sustained lower commodity price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which the Company could enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future. As a result, the Company’s internal cash flows would be reduced for affected periods. A sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows, which could negatively impact the Company’s liquidity, financial position and future results of operations.

Business Activities The Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Pioneer’s purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for, develop and produce oil and gas reserves.

Petroleum industry. Oil and NGL prices have steadily improved since the beginning of 2009, while gas prices have remained volatile and have generally trended lower since 2009. The decline in gas prices is primarily a result of growing gas production associated with discoveries of significant gas reserves in United States shale plays, combined with the warmer than normal 2011/2012 winter, which has resulted in gas storage levels being at historically high levels, and minimal economic demand growth in the United States. 6 Table of Contents PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY During 2009, 2010 and 2011, economic stimulus initiatives implemented in the United States and worldwide served to stabilize the United States and certain other economies in the world with resulting improvements in industrial demand and consumer confidence. However, other economies, such as those of certain European Union (or “Eurozone”) nations, continue to face economic struggles. The outlook for a continued worldwide economic recovery is cautiously optimistic, but remains uncertain; therefore, the sustainability of the recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company believes it is likely that commodity prices, especially North American gas prices, will continue to be volatile during 2012. Significant factors that will impact 2012 commodity prices include: the ongoing impact of economic stimulus initiatives in the United States and worldwide and continuing economic struggles in Eurozone nations’ economies; political and economic developments in North Africa and the Middle East; demand from Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas; and overall North American NGL and gas supply and demand fundamentals.
