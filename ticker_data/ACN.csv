1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc, an Irish public limited company, and its subsidiaries or, prior to September 1, 2009, to Accenture Ltd, a Bermuda exempted company that, on that date, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc, and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2009” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2009. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. Overview Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. We add value to clients and drive revenues based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. The global economic downturn in fiscal 2009 was widespread, leading to economic contraction in many industries and geographies where we operate. It also impacted the needs of our clients and the revenues in our consulting and outsourcing businesses. These changing demand patterns have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our new contract bookings and revenue growth, compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for fiscal 2009 were $21.58 billion, compared with $23.39 billion in fiscal 2008, a decrease of 8% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $5.15 billion, compared with $6.00 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 14% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. 40 Table of Contents In our consulting business, net revenues for fiscal 2009 were $12.56 billion, compared with $14.12 billion for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 11% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. Consulting net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $2.91 billion, compared with $3.61 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 19% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Starting in January 2009, the global economic downturn led to lower current demand for new consulting services. Many clients are focused on initiatives designed to deliver near- and medium-term cost savings and performance improvement. Some clients continue to exercise caution and to seek flexibility in launching new large consulting commitments and instead have shifted to a more phased approach to contracting work. Certain clients have slowed the pace of on-going projects and/or have deferred decisions to expand scope beyond current commitments. In addition, we are experiencing pricing pressures from some clients and in response, where practicable, have shifted to lower-cost resources at reduced price levels, particularly in our systems integration business. In our outsourcing business, net revenues for fiscal 2009 were $9.02 billion, compared with $9.27 billion for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 3% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 6% in local currency. Outsourcing net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $2.23 billion, compared with $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 7% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 1% in local currency. In response to clients seeking to reduce operating costs with requests for price concessions and more favorable contract terms, we have shifted and expect to continue to shift to lower-cost resources at a reduced price level. In addition, we have experienced a lower volume of scope expansions on existing contracts. Client strategy changes and consolidations have also resulted in more contract terminations and restructuring, primarily in Financial Services, and to a lesser extent in Communications & High Tech and Resources. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. During the majority of fiscal 2008, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported U.S. dollar revenues. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen against many currencies and this trend continued until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The foreign-exchange impact on our full fiscal 2009 revenue growth was approximately 8% lower growth in U.S. dollars, compared to our growth in local currency. In the future, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, our revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower than our growth in local currency. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, our revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher than our growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, sub-contractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with the growth of new outsourcing contracts. Utilization represents the percentage of our professionals’ time spent on billable consulting work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was approximately 86%, an increase from 83% for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, and was at the top of the range we expected. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was approximately 84%. Sales and marketing expense is driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, the development of new service offerings and client-targeting, image-development and brand-recognition activities. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space, which we seek to manage, as a percentage of revenues, at levels consistent with or lower than levels in prior-year periods. Operating expenses in fiscal 2009 also included restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and 41 Table of Contents $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future. Restructuring costs are reflected in operating expenses, along with reorganization costs and benefits, which may vary substantially from year to year. Reorganization costs and benefits were immaterial in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 32.3%, compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2008. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 31.7%, compared with 30.7% for fiscal 2008. The increase for both periods was driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability. Our cost-management strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing cost-management initiatives. In addition to the workforce actions included in the Restructuring costs, we aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take on-going actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have reduced our headcount to approximately 177,000 as of August 31, 2009, compared with more than 186,000 as of August 31, 2008. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2009 was 10%, compared to 16% for fiscal 2008. We evaluate voluntary attrition and have used increased involuntary terminations and reduced levels of new hiring as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. Our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage headcount, attrition and severance costs, recover increases in compensation and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.3% for fiscal 2009, compared with 17.7% for fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and a bad debt provision of $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues. This provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, in light of the current global economic conditions, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $2,644 million, compared with $3,012 million for fiscal 2008. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for fiscal 2009 was 12.3%, compared with 12.9% for fiscal 2008. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $420 million, compared with $785 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 8.2%, compared with 13.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008. Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Due to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many other currencies, this impact was unfavorable during fiscal 2009. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements.” 42 Table of Contents Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for fiscal 2009 were $23.90 billion, with consulting bookings of $12.78 billion and outsourcing bookings of $11.12 billion. New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $5.54 billion, with consulting bookings of $2.87 billion and outsourcing bookings of $2.68 billion. We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require Accenture to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Estimated revenues for applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or 43 Table of Contents decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Contract loss provisions recorded as of August, 31, 2009 and 2008 are immaterial. Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” (“SAB 101”), as amended by SAB No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” (“SAB 104”). We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB 101, as amended by SAB 104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs. Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. 44 Table of Contents Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements. Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FIN 48, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. 45 Table of Contents No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long- term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions. Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments in fiscal 2009 were our operating groups, which were Communications & High Tech, Financial Services, Products, Public Service and Resources. For presentation purposes, all discussions and operating group financial results relating to periods through the end of our 2009 fiscal year on August 31, 2009 refer to the historical stand-alone Public Service operating group, exclusive of the payer and provider components of the Health & Life Sciences industry group, which were included in our Products operating group in fiscal 2009. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. 46 Table of Contents While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations for Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net revenues (by operating group, geography and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Year Ended August 31, Percent(Decrease)IncreaseUS$ Percent(Decrease)IncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenuesfor the YearEndedAugust 31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 (in millions) OPERATING GROUPS Communications & High Tech $ 4,831 $ 5,450 (11 )% (4 )% 22 % 23 % Financial Services 4,323 5,005 (14 ) (6 ) 20 22 Products 5,530 6,069 (9 ) (1 ) 26 26 Public Service 2,984 2,871 4 11 14 12 Resources 3,880 3,963 (2 ) 8 18 17 Other 29 29 n/m n/m — — TOTAL Net Revenues 21,577 23,387 (8 )% — 100 % 100 % Reimbursements 1,594 1,927 (17 ) TOTAL REVENUES $ 23,171 $ 25,314 (8 )% GEOGRAPHY Americas $ 9,403 $ 9,726 (3 )% — % 44 % 42 % EMEA(1) 9,904 11,546 (14 ) (2 ) 46 49 Asia Pacific 2,270 2,115 7 12 10 9 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 21,577 $ 23,387 (8 )% — 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 12,556 $ 14,117 (11 )% (4 )% 58 % 60 % Outsourcing 9,021 9,270 (3 ) 6 42 40 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 21,577 $ 23,387 (8 )% — 100 % 100 % n/m = not meaningful (1) EMEA includes Europe, Middle East and Asia. We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised more than 10% of consolidated net revenues within the three years ended August 31, 2009: Year Ended August 31, 2009 2008 2007 United States 36 % 34 % 36 % United Kingdom 10 12 14 Results of Operations for Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net Revenues Since January 2009, our business has been affected by the continuing global economic downturn. Many clients have delayed new large consulting commitments, have slowed the pace of on-going projects and have reduced requests for incremental projects. In addition, in response to clients seeking to reduce 48 Table of Contents operating costs with requests for price concessions, where practicable, we have shifted to lower-cost resources at a reduced price level. As a result, most of our operating groups experienced either declines in or lower local currency growth in consulting revenues beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Consulting revenues declined 12% in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, primarily due to declines in Communications & High Tech of 26%, Products of 22%, Financial Services of 12% and Resources of 5%, partially offset by local currency growth in Public Service of 19%. In addition, most of our operating groups experienced lower local currency growth in outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter, outsourcing revenue growth in local currency slowed to 1%, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as growth in Products of 9%, Resources of 5% and Public Service of 2% was offset by declines in Financial Services of 8% and Communications & High Tech of 2%. The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency net revenues changes in aggregate for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008: • Communications & High Tech net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year-over-year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was due to declines across all industry groups in the Americas and EMEA regions. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth across all industry groups in the Asia Pacific region. Client strategy changes, particularly in Communications, have resulted in a number of contract modifications in fiscal 2009, which have had a negative impact on consulting revenues in fiscal 2009 and will continue to have a negative impact in fiscal 2010. Outsourcing revenues increased 4% in local currency, primarily driven by growth across all industry groups in the Asia Pacific region and in Electronics & High Tech and Media & Entertainment in the EMEA region, partially offset by a decline in Communications in the EMEA region. • Financial Services net revenues decreased 6% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in the EMEA region and, to a lesser extent, in Insurance and Capital Markets in the Americas region. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth in Banking in the Americas region and in Capital Markets in the EMEA region. Outsourcing revenues increased 2% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking in the EMEA region and in Insurance in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by declines in Capital Markets in the Americas and EMEA regions. Client strategy changes and consolidations in the financial services industry have resulted in a number of outsourcing contract terminations, which have had a negative impact on our revenues, contributing to a decline in outsourcing revenues during the second half of fiscal 2009. • Products net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined by 8% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year-over-year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was primarily due to declines in the EMEA region across all industry groups except Retail and in the Americas region across all industry groups except Consumer Goods & Services. Outsourcing revenues increased 10% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Consumer Goods & Services, Health & Life Sciences and Transportation & Travel Services across all geographic regions. • Public Service net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased 16% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in the Americas region. Outsourcing revenues increased 3% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in the EMEA region, partially offset by a decline in the Americas region. • Resources net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased 7% in local currency, with strong growth in the first half of fiscal 2009, partially offset by year-over-year 49 Table of Contents contraction during the second half. The aggregate growth was led by Utilities in the EMEA region and Natural Resources in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals in the EMEA region. Outsourcing revenues increased 8% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Utilities and Energy in the EMEA region and growth in Utilities in the Americas region. In the Americas region, net revenues were $9,403 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $9,726 million for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 3% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. We experienced growth in local currency in Brazil, driven by strong growth during the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, which moderated to flat growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This growth was offset by declines in the United States and Canada, where growth early in the year was more than offset by lower growth and/or declines that began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In the EMEA region, net revenues were $9,904 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $11,546 million for fiscal 2008, a decrease of 14% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. In general, growth moderated or declined across the EMEA region beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, led by declines in local currency in the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland and Sweden. In the Netherlands and Germany we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline in Germany and flat growth in the Netherlands. In the Asia Pacific region, net revenues were $2,270 million for fiscal 2009, compared with $2,115 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of 7% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Australia and Singapore. In Japan we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2009 were $20,527 million, a decrease of $1,775 million, or 8%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 88.6% from 88.1% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 were $18,933 million, a decrease of $1,442 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 87.7% from 87.1% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2009 was $16,330 million, a decrease of $1,798 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.5% from 71.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 was $14,736 million, a decrease of $1,465 million, or 9%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.3% from 69.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 31.7%, an increase from 30.7% in fiscal 2008, driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 was $2,159 million, a decrease of $111 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.0% from 9.7% over this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2009 were $1,789 million, a decrease of $92 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.3% from 8.0% over this period. 50 Table of Contents The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a bad debt provision of $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues. This provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, in light of global economic conditions, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future. We recorded net reorganization benefits of $3 million for fiscal 2009, which included a $16 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by $13 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities. We recorded net reorganization costs of $23 million for fiscal 2008, related to interest expense associated with carrying the liabilities. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2009, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $296 million, of which $287 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. However, resolution of current tax audits, initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $2,644 million, a decrease of $368 million, or 12%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 12.9% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Year Ended August 31, (Decrease)Increase(1) 2009 2008 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin (in millions) Communications & High Tech $ 608 13 % $ 657 12 % $ (49 ) Financial Services 467 11 661 13 (193 ) Products 646 12 864 14 (218 ) Public Service 365 12 260 9 104 Resources 558 14 570 14 (12 ) Total $ 2,644 12.3 % $ 3,012 12.9 % $ (368 ) (1) May not total due to rounding. 51 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Restructuring Costs (Non-GAAP) FY09 Operating Income Excluding Restructuring Costs (Non-GAAP)compared to FY08 Operating Income as Reported (GAAP)Year Ended August 31, (Decrease)Increase(2) 2009 2008 RestructuringCosts(1) Operating IncomeExcludingRestructuringCosts OperatingMargin Operating Income(as Reported) OperatingMargin Communications & High Tech $ 49 $ 657 14 % $ 657 12 % $ — Financial Services 53 521 12 661 13 (140 ) Products 66 712 13 864 14 (152 ) Public Services 38 403 13 260 9 142 Resources 46 604 16 570 14 34 Total(2) $ 253 $ 2,896 13.4 % $ 3,012 12.9 % $ (115 ) (1) Represents restructuring costs related to reducing excess real estate capacity and to realign the workforce incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding restructuring costs, because the restructuring costs meaningfully affect the comparability of our results of operations between periods. We believe that providing investors with this information gives additional insights into our on-going results of operations. (2) May not total due to rounding. While we have seen our net revenues contract, due to both the current global economic downturn and significant foreign-exchange rate fluctuations, we have improved our gross margins by focusing on contract profitability, particularly in our outsourcing business. This improvement was partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. In addition, each operating group recorded a portion of the $75 million bad debt provision and a portion of the $253 million restructuring cost. See “—General and Administrative Costs” and “—Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net.” During fiscal 2009, we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign-exchange rates on our operating income is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. The operating group commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008, exclusive of foreign-exchange rate, bad debt provision and restructuring impacts. • Communications & High Tech operating income increased due to improved outsourcing and consulting contract margins, offset by consulting revenue declines. In addition, fiscal 2008 reflected the impact of delivery inefficiencies on a small number of consulting contracts. • Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to consulting revenue declines, a lower proportion of high-margin consulting work and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins. • Products operating income decreased due to declines in consulting revenue and consulting contract margins, early-stage work at lower margins on a few large contracts in the fourth quarter and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins. • Public Service operating income increased due to resolution of a contract termination and improved delivery efficiencies compared with fiscal 2008 and consulting revenue growth. • Resources operating income increased due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins, partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. 52 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income was $50 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $65 million, or 56%, from fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 27.6% and 29.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower expenses related to tax rate changes and other adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities required in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Minority Interest Minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income of Accenture Ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture Ltd. Since January 2002, minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Minority interest was $348 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $157 million, or 31%, from fiscal 2008. The change was due to a $259 million decrease in Income before minority interest and a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 17% for fiscal 2009 from 22% for fiscal 2008. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.44 for fiscal 2009, compared with $2.65 for fiscal 2008. The $0.21 decrease in our earnings per share was primarily the result of $253 million in pre-tax restructuring costs, which reduced earnings per share by $0.24. Absent the restructuring costs, earnings per share increased $0.03 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: Increases of $0.11 from growth in revenues and operating income in local currency, $0.11 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, and $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.20 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, compared with fiscal 2008, and $0.05 from other items, including reorganization benefits and non-operating items. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 53 Table of Contents Results of Operations for Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Net revenues (by operating group, geography and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Year Ended August 31, PercentIncreaseUS$ PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenuesfor the Year EndedAugust 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 (in millions) OPERATING GROUPS Communications & High Tech $ 5,450 $ 4,600 18 % 10 % 23 % 23 % Financial Services 5,005 4,357 15 6 22 22 Products 6,069 4,913 24 17 26 25 Public Service 2,871 2,561 12 7 12 13 Resources 3,963 3,243 22 14 17 17 Other 29 22 n/m n/m — — TOTAL Net Revenues 23,387 19,696 19 % 11 % 100 % 100 % Reimbursements 1,927 1,757 10 TOTAL REVENUES $ 25,314 $ 21,453 18 % GEOGRAPHY Americas $ 9,726 $ 8,483 15 % 12 % 42 % 43 % EMEA 11,546 9,534 21 10 49 48 Asia Pacific 2,115 1,679 26 15 9 9 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 23,387 $ 19,696 19 % 11 % 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 14,117 $ 11,856 19 % 11 % 60 % 60 % Outsourcing 9,270 7,840 18 11 40 40 TOTAL Net Revenues $ 23,387 $ 19,696 19 % 11 % 100 % 100 % n/m = not meaningful Net Revenues The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency revenues changes for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007: • Communications & High Tech’s net revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by solid consulting and outsourcing growth. The consulting increase was driven by growth in the EMEA region across all industry groups. The outsourcing increase was led by growth in our Communications industry group across all geographic regions and in our Electronics & High Tech industry group in the Asia Pacific region. • Financial Services net revenues increased 6% in local currency, primarily due to outsourcing growth in our Banking industry group across all geographic regions and in our Insurance and Capital Markets industry groups in the Americas region. Consulting growth in our Banking and Insurance industry groups in the Americas region and in our Banking industry group in the Asia Pacific region was offset by a consulting revenue decline in the EMEA region, principally in our Banking and Capital Markets industry groups. During the first nine months of fiscal 2008, we 54 Table of Contents recorded modest growth in our Financial Services consulting business. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we experienced a slight year over year decline in our consulting business. • Products net revenues increased 17% in local currency, driven by strong consulting and outsourcing growth across all geographic regions. The consulting growth was led by our Retail and Health & Life Sciences industry groups in the Americas region and by our Consumer Goods & Services, Retail and Industrial Equipment industry groups in the EMEA region. The outsourcing growth was led by our Health & Life Sciences and Consumer Goods & Services industry groups in the Americas region and by our Consumer Goods & Services, Automotive and Industrial Equipment industry groups in the EMEA region. • Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency, primarily due to consulting growth across all geographic regions, led by strong growth in the EMEA and Americas regions, partially offset by an outsourcing decline in the Americas region. • Resources net revenues increased 14% in local currency, primarily driven by strong consulting growth across all geographic regions, led by our Utilities and Natural Resources industry groups, and by solid outsourcing growth, led by our Utilities and Energy industry groups in the Americas region. In the Americas region, we achieved net revenues of $9,726 million for fiscal 2008, compared with $8,483 million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Growth was principally driven by our business in the United States, Brazil and Canada. In the EMEA region, we achieved net revenues of $11,546 million for fiscal 2008, compared with $9,534 million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency. Growth was led by our business in Italy, Spain and France. In the Asia Pacific region, we achieved net revenues of $2,115 million in fiscal 2008, compared with $1,679 million for fiscal 2007, an increase of 26% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. Growth was principally driven by our business in Japan, China and Singapore. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were $22,302 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $3,342 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 88.1% from 88.4% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses were $20,375 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $3,172 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 87.1% from 87.3% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services was $18,128 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $2,717 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 71.6% from 71.8% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses was $16,201 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $2,547 million, or 19%, over fiscal 2007, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 69.3%. Gross margin (net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) remained flat at 30.7% during this period. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense was $2,271 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $367 million, or 19%, over fiscal 2007, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 9.7% during this period. 55 Table of Contents General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs were $1,880 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $262 million, or 16%, over fiscal 2007, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.0% from 8.2% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to strong revenue growth and our management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of our net revenues. Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded net reorganization costs of $23 million and $26 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to interest expense associated with carrying the reorganization liabilities. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2008, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $309 million, of which $299 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. However, resolution of current tax audits, initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Operating Income Operating income was $3,012 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $519 million, or 21%, from fiscal 2007. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 12.9% and 12.7% in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In addition, operating income for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of delivery inefficiencies on several contracts. • Products operating income increased due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability. • Public Service operating income decreased slightly in fiscal 2008. Consulting revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins were more than offset by profitability challenges, 56 Table of Contents including delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts, revenue adjustments on certain contracts and higher selling costs associated with business-development opportunities which fueled strong fourth quarter fiscal 2008 bookings. The fiscal 2007 operating income also reflects asset impairments associated with an outsourcing contract recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. • Resources operating income increased primarily due to strong revenue growth. Gain on Investments, net Gain on investments, net was $6 million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $12 million from fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2007 gain was primarily from a gain on the sale of a remaining investment from our portfolio of investments that was written down in fiscal 2002. Interest Income Interest income was $115 million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $40 million, or 26%, from fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates. Other Expense, net Other expense, net was $2 million in fiscal 2008, a decrease of $20 million from fiscal 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2008 and 2007 were 29.3% and 34.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2008 primarily as a result of benefits related to: final determinations of prior year tax liabilities, which reduced the rate by 3.9%; non-US research and development tax credits, which reduced the rate by 1.3%; and changes in the geographic distribution of income. These benefits were offset by expenses related to tax rate changes enacted during fiscal 2008, which reduced the value of our deferred tax assets. Fiscal 2007 included a reduction in the effective tax rate of 0.8%, recorded as a result of a nonrecurring benefit related to a reduction in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Minority Interest Minority interest eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income of Accenture Ltd represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture Ltd. Since January 2002, minority interest has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to minority shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Minority interest was $505 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of $26 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Income before minority interest of $474 million, partially offset by a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 22% for fiscal 2008 from 27% for fiscal 2007. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.65 in fiscal 2008, compared with $1.97 in fiscal 2007. The $0.68 increase in our earnings per share was primarily the result of the following: $0.25 from strong 57 Table of Contents growth in revenues and operating income in local currency; $0.19 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.12 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially offset by $0.02 from lower non-operating income. In addition, favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounted for $0.14 of the increase. For information regarding our earnings per share calculation, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, debt capacity available under various credit facilities and available cash reserves. We may also be able to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to: • take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; • acquire complementary businesses or technologies; • develop new services and solutions; • respond to competitive pressures; or • facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Accenture shares. As of August 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents was $4,542 million, compared with $3,603 million as of August 31, 2008, an increase of $939 million. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Year Ended August 31, 2009 2008 2007(1) 2009 to 2008Change(1) (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,160 $ 2,803 $ 2,631 $ 357 Investing activities (245 ) (324 ) (350 ) 79 Financing activities (1,850 ) (2,162 ) (2,128 ) 311 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (126 ) (29 ) 95 (96 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 939 $ 288 $ 247 $ 651 (1) May not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $357 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2008 also reflected a payment of $143 million to settle tax audits related to reorganization liabilities. Investing activities: The $79 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in spending on business acquisitions and lower spending on property and equipment partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments. Financing activities: The $311 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of common shares, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 14 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 58 Table of Contents We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Borrowing Facilities As of August 31, 2009, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions) Syndicated loan facility(1) $ 1,200 $ — Separate bilateral, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities(2) 350 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit(3) 188 — Total $ 1,738 $ — (1) This facility, which matures on July 31, 2012, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. This facility requires us to: (1) limit liens placed on our assets to (a) liens incurred in the ordinary course of business (subject to certain qualifications) and (b) other liens securing obligations not to exceed 30% of our consolidated assets; and (2) maintain a debt-to-cash-flow ratio not exceeding 1.75 to 1.00. We continue to be in compliance with these terms. As of August 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings under the facility. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. (2) We maintain two separate bilateral, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the bilateral revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings and $5 million, respectively, of borrowings under these facilities. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under these multicurrency credit facilities and lines of credit, based on the average annual balances, was approximately 4% in fiscal 2009 and 8% in fiscal 2008. (3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings under these various facilities. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $172 million and $169 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $1 million and $3 million as of August 31, 2009 and 2008. Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture Ltd has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture Ltd Class A common shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees. 59 Table of Contents A summary of our share purchase activity for cash during fiscal 2009 is as follows: Accenture Ltd Class ACommon Shares Accenture SCA Class ICommon Shares and AccentureCanada Holdings Inc.Exchangeable Shares Total Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases(1) 18,925,568 $ 571 — $ — 18,925,568 $ 571 Other share purchase programs — — 33,242,107 1,080 33,242,107 1,080 Other purchases(2) 5,881,300 204 — — 5,881,300 204 Total 24,806,868 $ 775 33,242,107 $ 1,080 58,048,975 $ 1,855 (1) We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by one or more subsidiaries of Accenture Ltd and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During fiscal 2009, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture Ltd Class A common shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares under those plans. As of August 31, 2009, our aggregate available authorization was $852 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program and the other share purchase programs. Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2009, we issued 1,125,645 Accenture Ltd Class A common shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”) filed on May 15, 2007. The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture Ltd Class A common shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by our senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees. Subsequent Developments On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland (the “Transaction”). On August 5, 2009, the shareholders of Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, voted in favor of the Transaction. The Transaction was subsequently completed on September 1, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Accenture Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. In the Transaction, all of the outstanding Class A and Class X common shares of Accenture Ltd were cancelled and Accenture plc issued Class A and Class X ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the cancelled Accenture Ltd Class A and Class X common shares, as applicable. The transaction has no impact on our financial condition or results of operations. On September 1, 2009, we filed an amendment to our registration statement to enable us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by our senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees. On September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a cash dividend of $0.75 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 16, 2009. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a cash dividend of $0.75 per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 13, 2009. Both dividends are payable on November 16, 2009. 60 Table of Contents On September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $4.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority, bringing Accenture’s total outstanding authority to approximately $4.9 billion. Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2009, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Contractual Cash Obligations(1)(2) Total Less than1 year 1-3years 3-5years More than5 years (in millions) Long-term debt $ 1 $ 1 $ — $ — $ — Operating leases 1,968 400 521 322 725 Retirement obligations(3) 135 29 28 23 55 Other commitments(4) 115 40 43 29 3 Total $ 2,219 $ 470 $ 592 $ 374 $ 783 (1) We adopted FIN 48 on September 1, 2007. The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (2) In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2009, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $296 million, of which $287 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (3) This represents projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Because these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (4) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights. Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. 61 Table of Contents To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“SFAS 161”). This Statement requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities about (i) how and why a company uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and its related interpretations, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. On December 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 161 and it did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” On September 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with FASB Staff Position 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” we elected to defer the adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 for our non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities. Such assets and liabilities, which include our Deferred contract costs, Property and equipment, net and Goodwill, will be subject to the provisions of SFAS 157 on September 1, 2009. We are currently assessing the potential impact the adoption of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 8 (Fair Value Measurements) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Effective September 1, 2008, we adopted the year-end measurement date provision of SFAS 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 106, and 132(R),” using an approach generally known as the “one measurement approach.” The adoption of the provision had the following impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet: decreased Retained earnings by $5.3 million, decreased Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by $0.3 million, decreased Other non-current assets by $2.7 million and increased Retirement obligation by $2.9 million. On March 1, 2009, we adopted SFAS 165, “Subsequent Events” (“SFAS 165”), which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. SFAS 165 sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The adoption of SFAS 165 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”), which is a revision of SFAS 141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for: recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed 62 Table of Contents and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; expensing acquisition related costs as incurred; and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 141R for acquisitions that occur on or after September 1, 2009. The impact of SFAS 141R on our Consolidated Financial Statements will depend on the size and nature of any acquisitions on or after September 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (previously referred to as minority interests). Upon adoption of SFAS 160 on September 1, 2009, we will be required to report any noncontrolling interests as a separate component of Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years — are intended to partially offset the impact of currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by Accenture’s Global Delivery Network. For designated cash flow hedges, gains (losses) currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services. As of August 31, 2009, it is anticipated that $8 million of the net loss, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $180 million and $146 million as of August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 63 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2009 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 17:35:24.593375
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc, an Irish public limited company, and its subsidiaries or, prior to September 1, 2009, to Accenture Ltd, a Bermuda exempted company that, on that date, became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc, and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2010” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2010. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Overview Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $5.42 billion, compared with $5.15 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency. Although some industries and geographies where we operate continue to be impacted by the economic downturn that began to adversely affect our business in January 2009, overall market demand for our services has improved in recent quarters. Based on new contract bookings recorded in fiscal 2010, we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, four of our five operating groups, including Products, Financial Services, Resources and Communications & High Tech, experienced quarterly year-over-year revenue growth in local currency. Looking forward, we anticipate that the level of growth will vary across segments and geographic regions and between consulting and outsourcing services. In addition, given there is still economic uncertainty in some markets around the world, our ability to effectively respond to changing client demand patterns will be a key driver of our performance. Net revenues for fiscal 2010 were $21.55 billion, compared with $21.58 billion in fiscal 2009, flat in U.S. dollars and a decrease of 2% in local currency. During fiscal 2010, many of the industries and geographies where we operate continued to be impacted by the economic downturn. This adversely affected our year-over-year consulting and outsourcing revenue growth, primarily in the first half of fiscal 2010. In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $3.09 billion, compared with $2.91 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 6% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency. Consulting net revenues for fiscal 2010 were $12.37 billion, compared with $12.56 44 Table of Contents billion for fiscal 2009, a decrease of 1% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. Although fiscal 2010 consulting revenues reflect the impact of the economic downturn, overall market demand for our consulting services improved during the second half of fiscal 2010. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and to a greater degree in the fourth quarter, we experienced quarterly year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, consulting growth in four of our five operating groups, led by Products and Financial Services, was offset by a decline in Health & Public Service, primarily due to our public service business. We are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. This trend is resulting in work volume growing faster than revenues, and we expect this to continue in the medium term. Clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver near- and medium-term cost savings and performance improvement. Projects with growth and transformational objectives are returning; however, clients remain cautious, seeking flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting work. In addition, the pricing environment continues to be competitive. In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $2.33 billion, compared with $2.23 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. Outsourcing net revenues for fiscal 2010 were $9.18 billion, compared with $9.02 billion for fiscal 2009, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. Overall market demand for our outsourcing services improved during the second half of fiscal 2010, and we are beginning to experience higher volumes and scope expansions on existing contracts. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and to a greater degree in the fourth quarter, we experienced quarterly year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency, with significant growth in Products. However, our outsourcing revenue growth during fiscal 2010 continued to be adversely impacted in three operating groups, primarily in Financial Services and to a lesser extent in Communications & High Tech and Resources, by the higher volume of contract terminations and restructurings that began to affect our business after the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not expect the fiscal 2009 contract terminations and restructurings to have a material year-over-year impact to outsourcing revenue growth in future periods. In addition, we are providing a greater proportion of outsourcing services through use of lower-cost resources at reduced price levels. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower. When compared to fiscal 2009, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies in fiscal 2010. This resulted in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue results that were approximately 2% better than our results in local currency for fiscal 2010. The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, sub-contractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts. Utilization represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on billable work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was approximately 86%, flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, a decrease from 88% for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and more in line with our target range. This level of utilization reflects continued demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network as well as an increase in demand in certain countries, including the United States. We are actively hiring to meet current and projected future demand. Our cost-management strategies include anticipating changes in demand for our services and executing cost-management initiatives. We aggressively plan and manage our payroll costs and take 45 Table of Contents actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. These cost-management strategies also include executing an increasing amount of our client delivery from our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations. Based on current and projected future demand, we increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 204,000 as of August 31, 2010, compared with approximately 177,000 as of August 31, 2009. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 17%, flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and more in line with historical levels prior to the economic downturn. This compares with 10% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We adjust levels of new hiring, evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. In addition, we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. Compensation increases for fiscal 2011, which for the majority of our personnel were effective September 1, 2010, are higher than in the prior fiscal year. As in prior fiscal years, we expect to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of this on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to hire sufficient employees with the skills and background where they are needed, manage attrition, recover increases in compensation and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 34.0%, compared with 32.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 was 33.6%, compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2009. As discussed more fully below, the primary driver for the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2010 was a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 20.9% for the fourth quarter fiscal 2010, compared with 19.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 20.1% for fiscal 2010, compared with 18.3% for fiscal 2009. Sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, investment in service offerings, and marketing- and advertising-related activities. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate, to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues. These actions include performing a greater proportion of these activities in lower-cost locations. During fiscal 2010, we directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and we streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. The combination of these two factors has resulted in a greater amount of payroll costs for our client-services personnel being directed to sales and marketing rather than to other activities, which are typically captured in cost of services. We have not reclassified fiscal 2009 amounts to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation, as it would be impractical to do so. The increase in sales and marketing in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues, primarily due to expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal 2009. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, general and administrative costs included a bad debt provision of $72 million, which reflected our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. Our margins could be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues. 46 Table of Contents Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $714 million, compared with $420 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 13.2%, compared with 8.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Operating income for fiscal 2010 was $2,915 million, compared with $2,644 million for fiscal 2009. Operating margin for fiscal 2010 was 13.5%, compared with 12.3% for fiscal 2009. Restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2009. Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $6.51 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.54 billion and outsourcing bookings of $2.97 billion. New contract bookings for fiscal 2010 were $24.98 billion, with consulting bookings of $13.62 billion and outsourcing bookings of $11.36 billion. We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Clients are seeking flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting consulting work, which is resulting in smaller initial total contract values than in the past. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from 47 Table of Contents those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” (“SAB 101”), as amended by SAB No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” (“SAB 104”). We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB 101, as amended by SAB 104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. 48 Table of Contents Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs. Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements. Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. 49 Table of Contents Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions. 50 Table of Contents Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications & High Tech, Financial Services, Health & Public Service (formed on September 1, 2009, by combining various healthcare-related components of our Products operating group with our Public Service operating group), Products and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of Net revenues because our management believes Net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. 51 Table of Contents Results of Operations for Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net revenues (by operating group, geography and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal Percent(Decrease)IncreaseU.S.$ Percent(Decrease)IncreaseLocalCurrency Percent ofTotal NetRevenues forFiscal 2010 2009 2010 2009 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications & High Tech $ 4,612 $ 4,831 (5 )% (7 )% 21 % 22 % Financial Services 4,446 4,323 3 1 21 20 Health & Public Service(1) 3,581 3,662 (2 ) (4 ) 17 17 Products(1) 4,985 4,853 3 1 23 23 Resources 3,911 3,880 1 (2 ) 18 18 Other 15 29 n/m n/m — — TOTAL Net Revenues(2) 21,551 21,577 — (2 )% 100 % 100 % Reimbursements 1,544 1,594 (3 )% TOTAL REVENUES(2) $ 23,094 $ 23,171 — GEOGRAPHY Americas $ 9,465 $ 9,403 1 % (1 )% 44 % 44 % EMEA(3) 9,583 9,904 (3 ) (4 ) 44 46 Asia Pacific 2,502 2,270 10 1 12 10 TOTAL Net Revenues(2) $ 21,551 $ 21,577 — (2 )% 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 12,371 $ 12,556 (1 )% (4 )% 57 % 58 % Outsourcing 9,179 9,021 2 — 43 42 TOTAL Net Revenues(2) $ 21,551 $ 21,577 — (2 )% 100 % 100 % n/m = not meaningful (1) On September 1, 2009, we formed the Health & Public Service operating group by combining various healthcare-related components of our Products operating group with our Public Service operating group.

We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised 10% or more of consolidated net revenues within fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 United States 36 % 36 % 34 % United Kingdom 10 10 12 52 Table of Contents Net Revenues Operating Groups The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency net revenues changes in aggregate for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009: • Communications & High Tech net revenues decreased 7% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined significantly in local currency, primarily due to declines across all industry groups in EMEA and Asia Pacific. While the fiscal 2010 consulting revenues reflected a decline, strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. The consulting revenue decline reflected some clients continuing to seek flexibility by shifting to a more phased approach to contracting work and focusing on managing the scope of existing projects. Outsourcing revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to a significant decline in Communications in Americas, partially offset by growth in Electronics & High Tech in Americas and Asia Pacific and Media & Entertainment in EMEA and Americas. Client strategy changes, which began in fiscal 2009, particularly in Communications, resulted in a number of contract modifications, which had a negative impact on outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2010. • Financial Services net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues increased in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking across all geographic regions and Capital Markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Insurance in EMEA and Americas. Outsourcing revenues declined significantly in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in EMEA and Americas, partially offset by growth in Insurance in EMEA. Modest year-over-year outsourcing growth in the fourth quarter partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. Client consolidations and strategy changes that resulted in contract terminations in fiscal 2009 had a negative impact on our outsourcing revenue in fiscal 2010. • Health & Public Service net revenues declined 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined in local currency, primarily due to a decline in Public Service in Americas, principally due to the impact of inefficient delivery on a contract, and declines in Health in Americas and EMEA and Public Service in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues increased modestly in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Americas in Health and Public Service. In addition, the growing uncertainty and challenges in the public sector, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom and several other countries in Europe, continue to have a significant impact on demand in our public service business throughout the world. The uncertainty of the economic situation resulted in longer sales cycles and a shift to a more phased approach to contracting work, with a focus on near-term cost savings rather than large transformational projects. These trends had a negative impact on our revenues and new contract bookings during fiscal 2010 and we expect this trend to continue. • Products net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to declines in EMEA and Americas across all industry groups except Consumer Goods & Services, which experienced significant growth in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected the continuation of the more conservative spending patterns of our clients, which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, consulting revenues were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 at two large clients as a result of completing several large projects and transitioning from front-end consulting to outsourcing services. Outsourcing revenues increased in 53 Table of Contents local currency, primarily driven by growth across all geographic regions and across all industry groups except Retail in Americas and Asia Pacific. • Resources net revenues decreased 2% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to declines in EMEA across all industry groups and in Utilities in Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Energy in Americas. Consulting revenues were impacted by our clients’ continued caution in launching new programs as well as their focus on slowing the pace of existing projects. Outsourcing revenues increased modestly in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Energy in Americas and Natural Resources in Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Utilities and Chemicals in Americas. Geographic Regions • Americas net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010, particularly in the United States, partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. We experienced declines in local currency across most countries in Americas, principally due to decreases in the United States and Brazil. • EMEA net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. We experienced declines in local currency across many countries in EMEA, principally due to decreases in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy and France. These declines were partially offset by growth in several countries, led by the United Kingdom. • Asia Pacific net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Singapore and Malaysia, partially offset by declines in Australia and Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2010 were $20,179 million, a decrease of $348 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.4% from 88.6% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2010 were $18,636 million, a decrease of $297 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.5% from 87.7% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2010 was $15,843 million, a decrease of $487 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.6% from 70.5% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2010 was $14,300 million, a decrease of $436 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 66.4% from 68.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 increased to 33.6% from 31.7% for fiscal 2009. The primary driver for the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2010 was a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. See “—Overview.” 54 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2010 was $2,658 million, an increase of $499 million, or 23%, from fiscal 2009, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 10.0% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. See “—Overview.” General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2010 were $1,668 million, a decrease of $120 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 7.7% from 8.3% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal 2009. Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future. We recorded net reorganization costs of $10 million for fiscal 2010, compared with net reorganization benefits of $3 million for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2010, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $272 million, of which $262 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. However, resolution of current tax audits, initiation of additional audits or litigation may delay final settlements. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 55 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2010 was $2,915 million, an increase of $271 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2009, and increased as percentage of net revenues to 13.5% from 12.3% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs in fiscal 2009, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2009.

(2) Represents restructuring costs related to reducing excess real estate capacity and to realign the workforce incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding restructuring costs, because the restructuring costs meaningfully affect the comparability of our results of operations between periods. We believe that providing investors with this information gives additional insights into our on-going results of operations. (3) May not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2010 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. In fiscal 2009, each operating group recorded a portion of the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter and 56 Table of Contents the $253 million restructuring cost recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in fiscal 2010, each operating group experienced expense savings resulting from the global consolation of office space in fiscal 2009. See “—General and Administrative Costs” and “—Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net.” The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rates, bad debt provision and restructuring cost impacts. • Communications & High Tech operating income decreased, primarily due to revenue declines and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, offset by improved outsourcing contract profitability. • Financial Services operating income increased, primarily driven by consulting revenue growth, improved utilization and outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by a decline related to lower outsourcing revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income decreased, primarily due to inefficient delivery on a few consulting contracts, higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and lower consulting contract profitability. In addition, fiscal 2009 results were favorably impacted by the resolution of a contract termination. • Products operating income was flat, as an increase related to higher outsourcing revenues was offset by a decline related to lower consulting revenues, lower consulting contract profitability and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. • Resources operating income increased, primarily driven by improved utilization, partially offset by a decline related to lower consulting revenues. Interest Income Interest income was $30 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $20 million, or 40%, from fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates. Other Expense, net Other expense, net was $16 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $12 million from fiscal 2009. The change was driven by higher net foreign currency exchange losses during fiscal 2010. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 29.3% and 27.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of lower benefits related to adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of income. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $280 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $68 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 13% for fiscal 2010 from 17% for fiscal 2009. 57 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.66 for fiscal 2010, compared with $2.44 for fiscal 2009. The $0.22 increase in fiscal 2010 earnings per share compared with fiscal 2009 earnings per share was primarily due to the following: a $0.24 increase reflecting the impact of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter last year; a $0.07 increase from a lower share count; and a $0.06 increase from favorable foreign exchange rates. These increase were partially offset by the following: a $0.04 decrease from lower revenue and operating income in local currency; a $0.01 decrease from lower reorganization benefits; a $0.03 decrease from lower non-operating items; and a $0.07 decrease from a higher effective income tax rate.

Many clients delayed new large consulting commitments, slowed the pace of on-going projects and reduced requests for incremental projects. In addition, in response to clients seeking to reduce operating costs with requests for price concessions, where practicable, we shifted to lower-cost resources at a reduced price level. As a result, most of our operating groups experienced either declines in or lower local currency growth in consulting revenues beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Consulting revenues declined 12% in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, primarily due to declines in Communications & High Tech of 26%, Products of 23%, Financial Services of 12% and Resources of 5%, partially offset by local currency growth in Health & Public Service of 11%. In addition, most of our operating groups experienced lower local currency growth in outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter, outsourcing revenue growth in local currency slowed to 1%, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as growth in Products of 8%, Resources of 5% and Health & Public Service of 5% was offset by declines in Financial Services of 8% and Communications & High Tech of 2%. Operating Groups The following net revenues by operating group commentary discusses local currency revenues changes for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008: • Communications & High Tech net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year-over-year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was due to declines across all industry groups in Americas and EMEA. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth across all industry groups in Asia Pacific. Client strategy changes, particularly in Communications, have resulted in a number of contract modifications in fiscal 2009, which had a negative impact on consulting revenues in fiscal 2009 and continued to have a negative impact in fiscal 2010. Outsourcing revenues increased 4% in local currency, primarily driven by growth across all industry groups in Asia Pacific and in Electronics & High Tech and Media & Entertainment in EMEA, partially offset by a decline in Communications in EMEA. • Financial Services net revenues decreased 6% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined 11% in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in EMEA and, to a lesser extent, in Insurance and Capital Markets in Americas. These declines were partially offset by consulting growth in Banking in the Americas region and in Capital Markets in EMEA. Outsourcing revenues increased 2% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking in EMEA and in Insurance in Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Capital Markets in Americas and EMEA. Client strategy changes and consolidations in the financial services industry resulted in a number of outsourcing contract terminations, which had a negative impact on our revenues, contributing to a decline in outsourcing revenues during the second half of fiscal 2009. • Health & Public Service net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Consulting and outsourcing revenues increased 11% and 4% in local currency, respectively. Growth was primarily in Americas and EMEA. • Products net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined by 8% in local currency, with growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, more than offset by year-over-year contraction during the last three quarters. The aggregate local currency decline was primarily due to declines in EMEA across all industry groups except Retail and in Americas across all industry 59 Table of Contents groups except Consumer Goods & Services. Outsourcing revenues increased 11% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Consumer Goods & Services and Transportation & Travel Services across all geographic regions. • Resources net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased 7% in local currency, with strong growth in the first half of fiscal 2009, partially offset by year-over-year contraction during the second half. The aggregate growth was led by Utilities in EMEA and Natural Resources in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals in the EMEA. Outsourcing revenues increased 8% in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Utilities and Energy in EMEA and growth in Utilities in Americas. Geographic Regions • Americas net revenues were flat in local currency. We experienced growth in local currency in Brazil, driven by strong growth during the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, which moderated to flat growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This growth was offset by declines in the United States and Canada, where growth early in the year was more than offset by lower growth and/or declines that began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. • EMEA net revenues decreased 2% in local currency. In general, growth moderated or declined across EMEA beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, led by declines in local currency in the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland and Sweden. In the Netherlands and Germany we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline in Germany and flat growth in the Netherlands. • Asia Pacific net revenues increased 12% in local currency. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Australia and Singapore. In Japan we experienced growth in local currency for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, partially offset by a fourth quarter decline. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2009 were $20,527 million, a decrease of $1,775 million, or 8%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 88.6% from 88.1% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 were $18,933 million, a decrease of $1,442 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 87.7% from 87.1% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2009 was $16,330 million, a decrease of $1,798 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.5% from 71.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2009 was $14,736 million, a decrease of $1,465 million, or 9%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.3% from 69.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 31.7%, an increase from 30.7% in fiscal 2008, driven primarily by improved overall outsourcing contract profitability. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 was $2,159 million, a decrease of $111 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.0% from 9.7% over this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to an increase in selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. 60 Table of Contents General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2009 were $1,789 million, a decrease of $92 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2008, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.3% from 8.0% over this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 of $72 million, or 0.3% of net revenues. This provision reflects our best estimate of collectibility risks on outstanding receivables, in light of global economic conditions, particularly from clients in high-risk industries or with potential liquidity issues. Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future. We recorded net reorganization benefits of $3 million for fiscal 2009, which included a $16 million reduction in reorganization liabilities offset by $13 million of interest expense associated with carrying these liabilities. We recorded net reorganization costs of $23 million for fiscal 2008, related to interest expense associated with carrying the liabilities. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $2,644 million, a decrease of $368 million, or 12%, from fiscal 2008, and decreased as percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 12.9% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 50 basis points compared with fiscal 2008. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2009 2008 (Decrease)Increase(2) OperatingIncome Percent of OGOperating Margin OperatingIncome Percent of OGOperating Margin (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications & High Tech $ 608 13 % $ 657 12 % $ (49 ) Financial Services 467 11 661 13 (193 ) Health & Public Service(1) 480 13 425 12 55 Products(1) 531 11 699 13 (169 ) Resources 558 14 570 14 (12 ) Total $ 2,644 12.3 % $ 3,012 12.9 % $ (368 ) (1) On September 1, 2009, we formed the Health & Public Service operating group by combining various healthcare-related components of our Products operating group with our Public Service operating group.

We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding restructuring costs, because the restructuring costs meaningfully affect the comparability of our results of operations between periods. We believe that providing investors with this information gives additional insights into our on-going results of operations. (3) May not total due to rounding. While we saw our net revenues contract, due to both the global economic downturn and significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we improved our gross margins by focusing on contract profitability, particularly in our outsourcing business. This improvement was partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. In addition, each operating group recorded a portion of the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and a portion of the $253 million restructuring cost. See “—General and Administrative Costs” and “—Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net.” During fiscal 2009, we estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign-exchange rates on our operating income is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. The operating group commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rate, bad debt provision and restructuring impacts. • Communications & High Tech operating income increased due to improved outsourcing and consulting contract margins, offset by consulting revenue declines. In addition, fiscal 2008 reflected the impact of delivery inefficiencies on a small number of consulting contracts. • Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to consulting revenue declines, a lower proportion of high-margin consulting work and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins. • Products operating income decreased due to declines in consulting revenue and consulting contract margins, early-stage work at lower margins on a few large contracts in the fourth quarter and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved outsourcing contract margins. • Public Service operating income increased due to resolution of a contract termination and improved delivery efficiencies compared with fiscal 2008 and consulting revenue growth. 62 Table of Contents • Resources operating income increased due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract margins, partially offset by higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. Interest Income Interest income was $50 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $65 million, or 56%, from fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 27.6% and 29.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2009 primarily as a result of lower expenses related to tax rate changes and other adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities required in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income of Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $348 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $157 million, or 31%, from fiscal 2008. The change was due to a $259 million decrease in Net income and a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average minority ownership interests to 17% for fiscal 2009 from 22% for fiscal 2008. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.44 for fiscal 2009, compared with $2.65 for fiscal 2008. The $0.21 decrease in our earnings per share was primarily the result of $253 million in pre-tax restructuring costs, which reduced earnings per share by $0.24. Absent the restructuring costs, earnings per share increased $0.03 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: Increases of $0.11 from growth in revenues and operating income in local currency, $0.11 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, and $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.20 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, compared with fiscal 2008, and $0.05 from other items, including reorganization benefits and non-operating items. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to: • take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; • acquire complementary businesses or technologies; • develop new services and solutions; or • facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Accenture shares. 63 Table of Contents As of August 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents was $4,838 million, compared with $4,542 million as of August 31, 2009, an increase of $297 million. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 2010 to 2009Change(1) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,092 $ 3,160 $ 2,803 $ (69 ) Investing activities (274 ) (245 ) (324 ) (29 ) Financing activities (2,429 ) (1,850 ) (2,162 ) (579 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (92 ) (126 ) (29 ) 34 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 297 $ 939 $ 288 $ (642 ) (1) May not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $69 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a net use of cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income. Investing activities: The $29 million increase in cash used was primarily due to lower net proceeds from available-for-sale investments and increased spending on business acquisitions, partially offset by lower spending on property and equipment. Financing activities: The $579 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increases in cash dividends paid and net purchases of shares. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Borrowing Facilities As of August 31, 2010, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions of U.S. dollars) Syndicated loan facility(1) $ 1,200 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities(2) 369 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit(3) 147 — Total $ 1,716 $ — (1) This facility, which matures on July 31, 2012, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings under the facility. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. 64 Table of Contents (2) We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings under these facilities. During fiscal 2010, we had no material borrowings under the facilities. Based on the average annual balances, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under these multicurrency credit facilities and lines of credit was approximately 4% in fiscal 2009. (3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings under these various facilities. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $152 million and $172 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $2 million and $1 million as of August 31, 2010 and 2009. Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees. A summary of our share purchase activity during fiscal 2010 is as follows: Accenture plc Class AOrdinary Shares Accenture SCA Class ICommon Shares andAccenture CanadaHoldings Inc.Exchangeable Shares Total Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases(1) 24,940,402 $ 986 — $ — 24,940,402 $ 986 Other share purchase programs — — 23,152,567 945 23,152,567 945 Other purchases(2) 3,666,119 139 — — 3,666,119 139 Total(3) 28,606,521 $ 1,125 23,152,567 $ 945 51,759,088 $ 2,071 (1) We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During fiscal 2010, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. (3) May not total due to rounding. As of August 31, 2010, our aggregate available authorization was $2,920 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2011. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, the company’s ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted, and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. 65 Table of Contents Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2010, we issued 3,977,356 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by our senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees. Subsequent Developments On September 29, 2010, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.45 per share on our Class A ordinary shares payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2010. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.45 per share on its Class I common shares payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 12, 2010. Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2010. Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2010, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Contractual Cash Obligations(1)(2) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars) Long-term debt $ 2 $ 1 $ — $ — $ 1 Operating leases 1,846 407 499 327 613 Retirement obligations(3) 119 16 24 23 56 Purchase obligations and other commitments(4) 166 62 71 30 3 Total $ 2,133 $ 486 $ 594 $ 380 $ 673 (1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (2) In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2010, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $272 million, of which $262 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Restructuring and Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (3) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (4) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights. 66 Table of Contents Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On September 1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on business combinations. The guidance establishes principles and requirements for: recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; expensing acquisition-related costs as incurred; and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The adoption of the guidance on business combinations did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On September 1, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB on noncontrolling interests, which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, previously referred to as minority interest, to be presented as a separate component in the shareholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As required, the guidance on noncontrolling interests was applied prospectively with the exception of presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively for all periods presented. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the FASB issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. The new guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance and requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price. The new guidance requires that a vendor use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence, respectively, do not exist as estimates of selling price. This guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 67 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Norwegian Krone, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/ Japanese yen, and U.S. dollar/Danish Krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by Accenture’s Global Delivery Network. For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services. As of August 31, 2010, it is anticipated that $1 million of the net gains, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $218 million and $180 million as of August 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2010 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 68 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:35:34.731174

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2011” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2011. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Overview Our results of operations can be affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $6.69 billion, compared with $5.42 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency. Net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $25.51 billion, compared with $21.55 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 18% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. This very strong growth during fiscal 2011 contrasts with a 2% local currency revenue decline during fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009. All of our operating groups experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, with very strong growth in Resources and Products. Based on new contract bookings over the last several quarters, we expect growth to continue in most areas of our business. We also expect the level of year-over-year growth will moderate, particularly in consulting, and vary across operating groups and geographic regions. There continues to be significant volatility in markets around the world, as well as economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Such volatility and uncertainty, should it continue, could adversely affect our clients and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. We continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations. In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $3.88 billion, compared with $3.09 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 25% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. Consulting net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $14.92 billion, compared with $12.37 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. All five operating groups experienced year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, driven by very strong growth in Resources and Products. In our consulting business overall, clients continue to focus on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. 42 Table of Contents Compared to fiscal 2010, we are providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network and we expect this trend to continue in the medium term. While the business environment remains competitive, pricing is stable with some improvement in certain areas of our business. In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $2.81 billion, compared with $2.33 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Outsourcing net revenues for fiscal 2011 were $10.58 billion, compared with $9.18 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. All five operating groups experienced year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, led by Communications & High Tech and Financial Services. Clients continue to be focused on projects that will improve operational effectiveness. Growth in outsourcing is driven by higher volumes, scope and geographic expansions and new work at existing clients, as well as services for new clients. As with systems integration consulting, compared to fiscal 2010 we are providing a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower. When compared to fiscal 2010, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies during fiscal 2011. This resulted in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue results that were approximately 9% and 3% better than our results in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011, respectively. The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts. Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on billable work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was approximately 85% and within our target range. This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 236,000 as of August 31, 2011, compared with approximately 223,000 as of May 31, 2011 and 204,000 as of August 31, 2010. This 16% year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, including those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 14%, compared with 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We adjust levels of new hiring, evaluate voluntary attrition and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. In addition, we also adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2012 became effective September 1, 2011. As in prior fiscal years, we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins 43 Table of Contents could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand, mobilize our employees globally on a timely basis, manage attrition, recover increases in compensation and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 33.1%, compared with 34.0% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Gross margin for fiscal 2011 was 32.9%, compared with 33.6% for fiscal 2010. Our contract profitability for fiscal 2011 was lower than fiscal 2010, as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix. Gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared with 20.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.3% for fiscal 2011, compared with 20.1% for fiscal 2010. Sales and marketing is driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, investment in offerings, and marketing- and advertising-related activities. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate, to maintain or lower these costs as a percentage of revenues. These actions include performing a greater proportion of general and administrative activities in lower-cost locations. For fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 0.2%, while general and administrative costs decreased 0.6% as a percentage of net revenues. The decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues, as well as a reduction in the bad debt reserve, partially offset by a provision for litigation matters. While we continue to manage these costs, we expect the reduction in general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues to moderate in fiscal 2012. Our margins could be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $923 million, compared with $714 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $3,470 million, compared with $2,915 million for fiscal 2010. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was 13.8%, compared with 13.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 13.6%, compared with 13.5% for fiscal 2010. Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign exchange rates on our operating expenses is similar to that disclosed for net revenues. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Bookings and Backlog New contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $8.44 billion, with consulting bookings of $4.16 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.28 billion. New contract bookings for fiscal 2011 were $28.83 billion, with consulting bookings of $15.41 billion and outsourcing bookings of $13.42 billion. 44 Table of Contents We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Clients continue to seek flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting consulting work, which is resulting in smaller initial total contract values than in the past. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting generally span one to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. 45 Table of Contents Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” (“SAB 101”), as amended by SAB No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” (“SAB 104”). We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with SAB 101, as amended by SAB 104. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs. Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future 46 Table of Contents delivery of another element. The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value of each element. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements. Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in the fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. 47 Table of Contents No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions. Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications & High Tech, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does 48 Table of Contents not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. Results of Operations for Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncreaseU.S.dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenuesfor Fiscal 2011 2010 2011 2010 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications & High Tech $ 5,434 $ 4,612 18 % 14 % 22 % 21 % Financial Services 5,381 4,446 21 18 21 21 Health & Public Service 3,861 3,581 8 7 15 17 Products 5,931 4,985 19 16 23 23 Resources 4,882 3,911 25 21 19 18 Other 18 15 n/m n/m — — TOTAL NET REVENUES(1) 25,507 21,551 18 % 15 % 100 % 100 % Reimbursements 1,846 1,544 20 TOTAL REVENUES(1) $ 27,353 $ 23,094 18 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Americas $ 11,271 $ 9,465 19 % 17 % 44 % 44 % EMEA(2) 10,854 9,583 13 11 43 44 Asia Pacific 3,383 2,502 35 23 13 12 TOTAL NET REVENUES(1) $ 25,507 $ 21,551 18 % 15 % 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 14,924 $ 12,371 21 % 17 % 59 % 57 % Outsourcing 10,583 9,179 15 13 41 43 TOTAL NET REVENUES(1) $ 25,507 $ 21,551 18 % 15 % 100 % 100 % n/m = not meaningful (1) May not total due to rounding.

We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised 10% or more of consolidated net revenues within fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 United States 35 % 36 % 36 % United Kingdom 10 10 10 49 Table of Contents Net Revenues The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010: Operating Groups • Communications & High Tech net revenues increased 14% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, with the exception of Electronics & High Tech in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, with the exception of Electronics & High Tech in EMEA. • Financial Services net revenues increased 18% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in Banking and Insurance in EMEA and all industry groups in Americas, partially offset by a decline in Banking in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Americas and EMEA. • Health & Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected growth in Americas and Asia Pacific, with significant growth in Health, partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA. The increase in consulting revenues was significantly impacted by a delivery inefficiency on a consulting contract in Public Service in Americas in fiscal 2010, which negatively affected revenues in that period. Outsourcing revenues increased due to growth in Americas, partially offset by a decrease in Public Service in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues also reflected revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies. In addition, the uncertainty and challenges in the public sector, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom and several other countries, continue to have a significant impact on demand in our public service business. This had a negative impact on our revenues and new contract bookings in our public service business during fiscal 2011, and we expect this trend to continue. • Products net revenues increased 16% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Consumer Goods & Services and Automotive. Outsourcing revenues increased, driven by growth across all geographic regions and most industry groups, led by Retail in Americas and Asia Pacific and Air, Freight & Travel Services in Americas and EMEA. • Resources net revenues increased 21% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected very significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Natural Resources and Energy. Outsourcing revenues increased, driven by growth in Energy and Natural Resources in Americas and Utilities and Energy in EMEA. Lower client demand for outsourcing services resulted in moderation of outsourcing revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and a shift in the mix of work towards consulting. This trend is expected to continue for the near term. Geographic Regions • Americas net revenues increased 17% in local currency, led by the United States, Brazil and Canada. • EMEA net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by growth in local currency in most countries, led by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa and Switzerland. 50 Table of Contents • Asia Pacific net revenues increased 23% in local currency, led by Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and India. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2011 were $23,882 million, an increase of $3,703 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.3% from 87.4% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2011 were $22,037 million, an increase of $3,401 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.4% from 86.5% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2011 was $18,966 million, an increase of $3,123 million, or 20%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.3% from 68.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2011 was $17,120 million, an increase of $2,820 million, or 20%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.1% from 66.4% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2011 decreased to 32.9% from 33.6% during this period. Our contract profitability for fiscal 2011 was lower than the same period in fiscal 2010, as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix. Gross margin also includes the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2011 was $3,094 million, an increase of $436 million, or 16%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.1% from 12.3% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2011 were $1,820 million, an increase of $152 million, or 9%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 7.1% from 7.7% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues, as well as a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services due to better than expected bad debt experience, partially offset by a provision for litigation matters of $75 million. 51 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2011 was $3,470 million, an increase of $556 million, or 19%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 13.6% from 13.5% during this period. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal Increase(1) 2011 2010 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications & High Tech $ 728 13 % $ 615 13 % $ 113 Financial Services 898 17 772 17 126 Health & Public Service 318 8 287 8 32 Products 680 11 592 12 88 Resources 846 17 649 17 197 Total $ 3,470 13.6 % $ 2,915 13.5 % $ 556 (1) May not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2011 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. During fiscal 2011, each operating group benefited from our management of general and administrative costs at a growth rate lower than that of our net revenues, as well as a reduction in the bad debt reserve. In addition, in fiscal 2011 each operating group experienced higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand and recorded a portion of the provision for litigation matters. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010, exclusive of these impacts. • Communications & High Tech operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. • Financial Services operating income increased, primarily due to very strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability. • Health & Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth, including revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability. Fiscal 2010 operating income included the negative impact of inefficient delivery on a few consulting contracts in Public Service. • Products operating income increased, primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. Products operating results in both periods were also impacted by expected lower margins on certain contracts. • Resources operating income increased, primarily driven by significant consulting revenue growth. Interest Income Interest income for fiscal 2011 was $41 million, an increase of $11 million, or 37%, over fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and cash balances. 52 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net for fiscal 2011 was $17 million, an increase of $32 million over fiscal 2010. The change was driven by net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2011, compared with net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2010. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 27.3%, compared with 29.3% for fiscal 2010. The effective tax rate was lower in fiscal 2011 due to a number of factors that impact our geographic mix of income, partially offset by a net increase in reserves related to ongoing tax audits. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2011 was $276 million, a decrease of $4 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2010. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 10% for fiscal 2011 from 13% for fiscal 2010, partially offset by an increase in Net income of $493 million. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.40 for fiscal 2011, compared with $2.66 for fiscal 2010. The $0.74 increase in our earnings per share was due to increases of $0.42 from higher revenues and operating results in local currency, $0.11 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, $0.09 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.08 from favorable foreign currency exchange rates and $0.04 from higher non-operating income, compared with fiscal 2010. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 53 Table of Contents Results of Operations for Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal Percent(Decrease)IncreaseU.S.dollars Percent(Decrease)IncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenuesfor Fiscal 2010 2009 2010 2009 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications & High Tech $ 4,612 $ 4,831 (5 %) (7 %) 21 % 22 % Financial Services 4,446 4,323 3 1 21 20 Health & Public Service 3,581 3,662 (2 ) (4 ) 17 17 Products 4,985 4,853 3 1 23 23 Resources 3,911 3,880 1 (2 ) 18 18 Other 15 29 n/m n/m — — TOTAL NET REVENUES(1) 21,551 21,577 — (2 %) 100 % 100 % Reimbursements 1,544 1,594 (3 %) TOTAL REVENUES(1) $ 23,094 $ 23,171 — GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Americas $ 9,465 $ 9,403 1 % (1 %) 44 % 44 % EMEA(2) 9,583 9,904 (3 ) (4 ) 44 46 Asia Pacific 2,502 2,270 10 1 12 10 TOTAL NET REVENUES(1) $ 21,551 $ 21,577 — (2 %) 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 12,371 $ 12,556 (1 %) (4 %) 57 % 58 % Outsourcing 9,179 9,021 2 — 43 42 TOTAL NET REVENUES(1) $ 21,551 $ 21,577 — (2 %) 100 % 100 % n/m = not meaningful (1) May not total due to rounding.

Net Revenues The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenues changes in aggregate for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009: Operating Groups • Communications & High Tech net revenues decreased 7% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined significantly in local currency, primarily due to declines across all industry groups in EMEA and Asia Pacific. While the fiscal 2010 consulting revenues reflected a decline, strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. The consulting revenue decline reflected some clients continuing to seek flexibility by shifting to a more phased approach to contracting work and focusing on managing 54 Table of Contents the scope of existing projects. Outsourcing revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to a significant decline in Communications in Americas, partially offset by growth in Electronics & High Tech in Americas and Asia Pacific and Media & Entertainment in EMEA and Americas. Client strategy changes, which began in fiscal 2009, particularly in Communications, resulted in a number of contract modifications, which had a negative impact on outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2010. • Financial Services net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues increased in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Banking across all geographic regions and Capital Markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Insurance in EMEA and Americas. Outsourcing revenues declined significantly in local currency, primarily due to declines in Banking in EMEA and Americas, partially offset by growth in Insurance in EMEA. Modest year-over-year outsourcing growth in the fourth quarter partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. Client consolidations and strategy changes that resulted in contract terminations in fiscal 2009 had a negative impact on our outsourcing revenue in fiscal 2010. • Health & Public Service net revenues declined 4% in local currency. Consulting revenues declined in local currency, primarily due to a decline in Public Service in Americas, principally due to the impact of inefficient delivery on a contract, and declines in Health in Americas and EMEA and Public Service in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues increased modestly in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Americas in Health and Public Service. In addition, the growing uncertainty and challenges in the public sector, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom and several other countries in Europe, continued to have a significant impact on demand in our public service business throughout the world. The uncertainty of the economic situation resulted in longer sales cycles and a shift to a more phased approach to contracting work, with a focus on near-term cost savings rather than large transformational projects. • Products net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to declines in EMEA and Americas across all industry groups except Consumer Goods & Services, which experienced significant growth in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected the continuation of the more conservative spending patterns of our clients, which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, consulting revenues were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 at two large clients as a result of completing several large projects and transitioning from front-end consulting to outsourcing services. Outsourcing revenues increased in local currency, primarily driven by growth across all geographic regions and across all industry groups except Retail in Americas and Asia Pacific. • Resources net revenues decreased 2% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Consulting revenues declined modestly in local currency, primarily due to declines in EMEA across all industry groups and in Utilities in Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Energy in Americas. Consulting revenues were impacted by our clients’ continued caution in launching new programs as well as their focus on slowing the pace of existing projects. Outsourcing revenues increased modestly in local currency, primarily driven by growth in Energy in Americas and Natural Resources in Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Utilities and Chemicals in Americas. 55 Table of Contents Geographic Regions • Americas net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010, particularly in the United States, partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. We experienced declines in local currency across most countries in Americas, principally due to decreases in the United States and Brazil. • EMEA net revenues decreased 4% in local currency. While the fiscal 2010 net revenues reflected a decline, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 partially offset revenue declines in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. We experienced declines in local currency across many countries in EMEA, principally due to decreases in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy and France. These declines were partially offset by growth in several countries, led by the United Kingdom. • Asia Pacific net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 more than offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010. Growth in local currency was principally driven by our business in Singapore and Malaysia, partially offset by declines in Australia and Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2010 were $20,179 million, a decrease of $348 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.4% from 88.6% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2010 were $18,636 million, a decrease of $297 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.5% from 87.7% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2010 was $15,843 million, a decrease of $487 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.6% from 70.5% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2010 was $14,300 million, a decrease of $436 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 66.4% from 68.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 increased to 33.6% from 31.7% during this period. The primary driver for the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2010 was a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2010 was $2,658 million, an increase of $499 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2009, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.3% from 10.0% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by a change related to the implementation of our sales-effectiveness model, which directed a higher percentage of resource capacity to selling and other business-development activities and streamlined our approach to capturing time spent on business-development activities. 56 Table of Contents General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2010 were $1,668 million, a decrease of $120 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2009, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 7.7% from 8.3% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as expense savings resulting from the global consolidation of office space in fiscal 2009. Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net We recorded net reorganization costs of $10 million for fiscal 2010, compared with net reorganization benefits of $3 million for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We recorded restructuring costs of $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. These costs included $111 million related to global consolidation of our office space and $142 million related to realignment of our workforce, primarily at the senior-executive level, to reset our cost structure and better align our organization for the future. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2010 was $2,915 million, an increase of $271 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2009, and increased as percentage of net revenues to 13.5% from 12.3% during this period. The restructuring costs of $253 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 reduced Operating margin by 110 basis points for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of the restructuring costs in fiscal 2009, Operating income as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2009. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal Increase(Decrease) 2010 2009 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications & High Tech $ 615 13 % $ 608 13 % $ 7 Financial Services 772 17 467 11 305 Health & Public Service 287 8 480 13 (193 ) Products 592 12 531 11 61 Resources 649 17 558 14 91 Total $ 2,915 13.5 % $ 2,644 12.3 % $ 271 57 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Restructuring Costs (Non-GAAP) FY10 Operating Income as Reported (GAAP) compared to FY09 Operating Income Excluding Restructuring Costs (Non-GAAP) Fiscal (Decrease)Increase(1) 2010 2009 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin RestructuringCosts(2) Operating IncomeExcludingRestructuringCosts OperatingMargin (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications & High Tech $ 615 13 % $ 49 $ 657 14 % $ (42 ) Financial Services 772 17 53 521 12 252 Health & Public Service 287 8 46 525 14 (239 ) Products 592 12 58 589 12 3 Resources 649 17 46 604 16 45 Total(1) $ 2,915 13.5 % $ 253 $ 2,896 13.4 % $ 18 (1) May not total due to rounding. (2) Represents restructuring costs related to reducing excess real estate capacity and to realign the workforce incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding restructuring costs, because the restructuring costs meaningfully affect the comparability of our results of operations between periods. We believe that providing investors with this information gives additional insights into our ongoing results of operations. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2010 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenues. In fiscal 2009, each operating group recorded a portion of the $72 million bad debt provision recorded in the first quarter and the $253 million restructuring cost recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in fiscal 2010, each operating group experienced expense savings resulting from the global consolation of office space in fiscal 2009. See “—General and Administrative Costs” and “—Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net.” The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rates, bad debt provision and restructuring cost impacts. • Communications & High Tech operating income decreased, primarily due to revenue declines and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues, offset by improved outsourcing contract profitability. • Financial Services operating income increased, primarily driven by consulting revenue growth, improved utilization and outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by a decline related to lower outsourcing revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income decreased, primarily due to inefficient delivery on a few consulting contracts, higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues and lower consulting contract profitability. In addition, fiscal 2009 results were favorably impacted by the resolution of a contract termination. • Products operating income was flat, as an increase related to higher outsourcing revenues was offset by a decline related to lower consulting revenues, lower consulting contract profitability and higher selling costs as a percentage of net revenues. • Resources operating income increased, primarily driven by improved utilization, partially offset by a decline related to lower consulting revenues. 58 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income was $30 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $20 million, or 40%, from fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates. Other Expense, net Other expense, net was $16 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $12 million over fiscal 2009. The change was driven by higher net foreign currency exchange losses during fiscal 2010. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rates for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 29.3% and 27.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of lower benefits related to adjustments to prior-year tax liabilities in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of income. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $280 million in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $68 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 13% for fiscal 2010 from 17% for fiscal 2009. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.66 for fiscal 2010, compared with $2.44 for fiscal 2009. The $0.22 increase in fiscal 2010 earnings per share compared with fiscal 2009 earnings per share was primarily due to the following: a $0.24 increase reflecting the impact of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009; a $0.07 increase from a lower share count; and a $0.06 increase from favorable foreign exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by the following: a $0.04 decrease from lower revenue and operating income in local currency; a $0.01 decrease from lower reorganization benefits; a $0.03 decrease from lower non-operating items; and a $0.07 decrease from a higher effective income tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to: • take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; • acquire complementary businesses or technologies; • develop new services and solutions; or • facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Accenture shares. As of August 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents was $5.7 billion, compared with $4.8 billion as of August 31, 2010. 59 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2011 2010 2009 2011 to 2010Change(1) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,442 $ 3,092 $ 3,160 $ 350 Investing activities (703 ) (274 ) (245 ) (430 ) Financing activities (2,122 ) (2,429 ) (1,850 ) 308 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 246 (92 ) (126 ) 338 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 863 $ 297 $ 939 $ 566 (1) May not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $350 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and changes in other operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues). Investing activities: The $430 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Goodwill) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Financing activities: The $308 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower cash dividends paid as a result of our transition to semi-annual dividend payments. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 60 Table of Contents Borrowing Facilities As of August 31, 2011, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: FacilityAmount BorrowingsUnder Facilities (in millions of U.S. dollars) Syndicated loan facility(1) $ 1,200 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities(2) 480 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit(3) 169 — Total $ 1,849 $ — (1) This facility, which matures on July 31, 2012, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of August 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no borrowings under the facility. (2) We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no borrowings under these facilities. (3) We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no borrowings under these various facilities. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $178 million and $152 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $4 million and $2 million as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees. As of August 31, 2011, our aggregate available authorization was $1,042 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs. Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2011 was as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture SCA Class I Common Shares and Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc.

These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During fiscal 2011, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. (3) May not total due to rounding. 61 Table of Contents We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2012. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted, and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2011, we issued 6,837,070 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees. Subsequent Developments On September 26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 14, 2011. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 11, 2011. Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2011. On September 26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $5.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority bringing Accenture’s total outstanding authority to approximately $6.0 billion. 62 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2011, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Contractual Cash Obligations(1)(2) Total(5) Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars) Long-term debt $ 4 $ 4 $ — $ — $ — Operating leases 1,842 427 543 317 556 Retirement obligations(3) 113 12 24 23 55 Purchase obligations and other commitments(4) 241 112 93 21 14 Total $ 2,200 $ 555 $ 660 $ 361 $ 625 (1) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (2) In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2011, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $307 million, of which $295 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Reorganization and Restructuring Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (3) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (4) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. (5) May not total due to rounding. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights. Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 63 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation in previous guidance; requires that arrangement considerations be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price; and requires a vendor to use estimates of a selling price developed in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis for all deliverables that meet the remaining separation criteria when vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence, respectively, do not exist as estimates of selling price. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by Accenture’s Global Delivery Network. For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services. As of August 31, 2011, it was anticipated that $9 million of the net gains, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $358 million and $218 million as of August 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 64 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2011 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 17:35:34.185561
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2012” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2012. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.OverviewRevenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility in markets around the world, as well as economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many of the markets where we operate, which could impact our business, particularly in the United States and Europe. Such volatility and uncertainty has adversely affected and will in the future affect our clients and the levels of business activities in some industries and geographies where we operate, which may reduce demand for our services. This has also impacted the types of services our clients are demanding; for example, clients are requesting a higher volume of outsourcing services and placing a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives. These changing demand patterns could have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations. We continue to monitor this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $6.84 billion, compared with $6.69 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency. Net revenues for fiscal 2012 were $27.86 billion, compared with $25.51 billion for fiscal 2011, an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. All of our operating groups experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and continued to moderate in consulting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We expect the level of year-over-year growth to continue to moderate in the near term and vary across operating groups and geographic regions, with growth in certain areas of our business, offset by lower growth or declines in other areas, particularly in consulting and in Europe. In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $3.74 billion, compared with $3.88 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a decrease of 4% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 2% in local currency. Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2012 were $15.56 billion, compared with $14.92 billion for fiscal 2011, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency. Four of our five operating groups, including Health & Public Service, Financial Services, Resources and Products, experienced quarterly year-over-year revenue growth in local currency, while Communications, Media & Technology experienced a significant decline in quarterly year-over-year revenue. In our consulting business overall, clients are exercising caution by reducing their demand for small projects. In addition, when larger projects are initiated, they are of longer duration and convert to revenue at a slower rate. These trends have led to lower consulting revenue growth and declines in certain areas of our business, and we expect this to continue in the near term. Clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. We are also experiencing growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including analytics, cloud computing and mobility. Compared to fiscal 2011, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network, and we expect this trend to continue. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable, and we saw some improvement in certain areas of our business.In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $3.10 billion, compared with $2.81 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2012 were $12.30 billion, compared with $10.58 billion for fiscal 2011, an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars and 19% in local currency. All five of our operating groups experienced year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during the 30Table of Contentsfourth quarter of fiscal 2012, led by very significant growth in Financial Services and very strong growth in Products, Communication, Media & Technology and Resources. This strong demand for outsourcing services resulted in a greater proportion of revenues in outsourcing, particularly in Communications, Media & Technology and Financial Services, and this trend is expected to continue. Clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. Growth in outsourcing was driven by higher volumes, scope and geographic expansions and new work at existing clients, as well as services for new clients. Compared to fiscal 2011, we provided a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower. When compared to fiscal 2011, the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies during fiscal 2012. This resulted in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue results that were approximately 7% and 2% lower than our revenue results in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively. The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with new outsourcing contracts. Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on billable work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was approximately 87%, flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2012, and within our target range. This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that payroll costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 257,000 as of August 31, 2012, compared with approximately 249,000 as of May 31, 2012 and 236,000 as of August 31, 2011. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, including those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 12%, down from 13% in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with increases or decreases in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2012 became effective September 1, 2011. As in prior fiscal years, we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing services or a decrease in demand due to U.S. government spending reductions; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; recover increases in compensation; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 32.9%, compared with 33.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was 32.3%, compared with 32.9% for fiscal 2011. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was lower than for fiscal 2011, principally due to higher payroll costs as a percentage of net revenues, including costs associated with integration of acquisitions and investments in offerings, partially offset by higher contract profitability.Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, compared with 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.4% for fiscal 2012, compared with 19.3% for fiscal 2011. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business-development activities, investment in offerings, and marketing- and advertising-related activities. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. These actions include performing a greater proportion of general and administrative activities in lower-cost locations. For fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 20 basis points, while general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 60 basis points. These decreases were principally due to growth of these costs at a rate lower than that of net revenues. In addition, during fiscal 2011, we recorded a provision for litigation matters for $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues, which was partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and 31Table of Contentsunbilled services. Our margins could be adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues.Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was $940 million, compared with $923 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Operating income for fiscal 2012 was $3,872 million, compared with $3,470 million for fiscal 2011. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was 13.8%, flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Operating margin for fiscal 2012 was 13.9%, compared with 13.6% for fiscal 2011.Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Bookings and BacklogNew contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $9.21 billion, with consulting bookings of $4.27 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.94 billion. New contract bookings for fiscal 2012 were $32.23 billion, with consulting bookings of $16.61 billion and outsourcing bookings of $15.62 billion.We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Clients continue to seek flexibility by using a phased approach to contracting work. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.Revenue RecognitionOur contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements 32Table of Contentsin the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred. We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value of each element. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.33Table of ContentsOur consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.Income TaxesDetermining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.Revenues by Segment/Operating GroupOur five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific 34Table of Contentsdeliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.Results of Operations for Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncreaseU.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2012 2011 2012 2011 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology (1)$5,907 $5,434 9% 11% 21% 22%Financial Services5,843 5,381 9 11 21 21Health & Public Service4,256 3,861 10 11 15 15Products6,563 5,931 11 13 24 23Resources5,275 4,882 8 10 19 19Other19 18 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES (2)27,862 25,507 9% 11% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,916 1,846 4 TOTAL REVENUES$29,778 $27,353 9% GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Americas$12,523 $11,271 11% 13% 45% 44%EMEA (3)11,296 10,854 4 8 41 43Asia Pacific4,043 3,383 20 18 14 13TOTAL NET REVENUES (2)$27,862 $25,507 9% 11% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$15,562 $14,924 4% 6% 56% 59%Outsourcing12,300 10,583 16 19 44 41TOTAL NET REVENUES$27,862 $25,507 9% 11% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningful(1)On September 1, 2011, the Company renamed the Communications & High Tech operating group to Communications, Media & Technology.

All five of our operating groups experienced double-digit year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2012. Consulting revenue growth in local currency moderated significantly during the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012. While Health & Public Service experienced strong growth in consulting revenues in local currency during fiscal 2012, year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency either moderated or declined for all other operating groups in the second half of fiscal 2012.The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011:Operating Groups•Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, led by Electronics & High Tech in EMEA, principally due to a significant short-term increase from one contract. We also experienced outsourcing growth in Communications across all geographic regions. Consulting revenues declined slightly, with growth in the first half of fiscal 2012 offset by contraction during the second half of the fiscal year. For fiscal 2012, consulting revenues reflected a decline in Communications in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Media & Entertainment in Americas and Electronics & High Tech in Asia Pacific. Some of our clients, primarily in Communications, continued to exercise caution by reducing and/or deferring their investment in consulting, which had a negative impact on our consulting revenues. We expect Communications, Media & Technology net revenues to decline year-over-year in the near term.•Financial Services net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth, driven by all industry groups in Americas, including the impact of an acquisition in Banking. We also experienced outsourcing growth across all industry groups in Asia Pacific and Capital Markets in EMEA. Consulting revenues reflected modest growth, driven by significant growth in Insurance across all geographic regions, including the impact of an acquisition. This growth was partially offset by declines in Banking in EMEA and Americas and Capital Markets in EMEA. The uncertainty in the banking and capital markets industries impacted our consulting revenue growth during fiscal 2012 and we expect this trend to continue in the near term.•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, led by Health across all geographic regions and Public Service in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by Health across all geographic regions and Public Service in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2011 reflected revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies. The global uncertainty and challenges in the public sector continue to have an impact on demand in our public service business. This impact may increase if U.S. government spending reductions are implemented.•Products net revenues increased 13% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased, driven primarily by growth across all industry groups in Americas and most industry groups in Asia Pacific. By industry group, growth was led by Retail and Industrial Equipment. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and most industry groups, led by Life Sciences, Air, Freight & Travel Services and Retail.•Resources net revenues increased 10% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased, driven by Energy across all geographic regions and Natural Resources in Asia Pacific and EMEA, partially offset by a decline in Natural Resources in Americas. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and all industry groups, led by Energy and Natural Resources.36Table of ContentsGeographic Regions•Americas net revenues increased 13% in local currency, led by the United States and Brazil. In general, revenue growth moderated across Americas in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012.•EMEA net revenues increased 8% in local currency, driven by growth in Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and South Africa. In general, revenue growth moderated across EMEA in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012.•Asia Pacific net revenues increased 18% in local currency, driven by Australia, Japan, China, Singapore, South Korea and India.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $25,906 million, an increase of $2,024 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.0% from 87.3% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2012 were $23,991 million, an increase of $1,954 million, or 9%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.1% from 86.4% during this period.Cost of ServicesCost of services for fiscal 2012 was $20,790 million, an increase of $1,824 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.8% from 69.3% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2012 was $18,875 million, an increase of $1,754 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.7% from 67.1% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 decreased to 32.3% from 32.9% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was lower than for fiscal 2011, principally due to higher payroll costs as a percentage of net revenues, including costs associated with investments in offerings and acquisitions, partially offset by higher contract profitability.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 was $3,303 million, an increase of $209 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.9% from 12.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to growth of business development costs at a rate lower than that of net revenues.General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2012 were $1,811 million, a decrease of $9 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.5% from 7.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues. In addition, during fiscal 2011, we recorded a provision for litigation matters for $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues, which was partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services.Operating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2012 was $3,872 million, an increase of $401 million, or 12%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 13.9% from 13.6% during this period.

In addition, during fiscal 2011, each operating group recorded a portion of the $75 million provision for litigation matters, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, exclusive of these impacts.•Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased, primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth, principally related to a significant short-term increase from one contract.•Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to a lower proportion of high margin consulting work, costs related to recent acquisitions and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by strong outsourcing revenue growth.•Health & Public Service operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by the negative impact of delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts. Health & Public Service operating margin was impacted by administrative and compliance costs associated with our U.S. Federal practice, and we expect this trend to continue. Health & Public Service profitability could also be impacted if U.S. government spending reductions are implemented.•Products operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and improved consulting and outsourcing contract profitability.•Resources operating income increased, primarily due to strong revenue growth.Interest IncomeInterest income for fiscal 2012 was $43 million, an increase of $1 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher cash balances.Other Income, netOther income, net for fiscal 2012 was $6 million, a decrease of $11 million from fiscal 2011. The change was driven primarily by lower net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 27.6%, compared with 27.3% for fiscal 2011. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 included higher expenses for increases in tax reserves and changes in our geographic mix of income, partially offset by higher benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2012 was $271 million, a decrease of $4 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2011. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 9% for fiscal 2012 from 10% for fiscal 2011, partially offset by an increase in Net income of $272 million.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $3.84 for fiscal 2012, compared with $3.39 for fiscal 2011. The $0.45 increase in our earnings per share was due to increases of $0.40 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from a higher effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower non-operating income, compared with fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2012 payment of cash dividends. This restatement resulted in a one cent decrease in diluted earnings per share from $3.40 to $3.39 for fiscal 2011.

Consulting revenues reflected growth in Americas and Asia Pacific, with significant growth in Health, partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA. The increase in consulting revenues was significantly impacted by a delivery inefficiency on a consulting contract in Public Service in Americas in fiscal 2010, which negatively affected revenues in that period. Outsourcing revenues increased due to growth in Americas, partially offset by a decrease in Public Service in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues 39Table of Contentsalso reflected revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies. In addition, the uncertainty and challenges in the public sector, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom and several other countries, continued to have a significant impact on demand in our public service business. This had a negative impact on our revenues and new contract bookings in our public service business during fiscal 2011.•Products net revenues increased 16% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Consumer Goods & Services and Automotive. Outsourcing revenues increased, driven by growth across all geographic regions and most industry groups, led by Retail in Americas and Asia Pacific and Air, Freight & Travel Services in Americas and EMEA.•Resources net revenues increased 21% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected very significant growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Natural Resources and Energy. Outsourcing revenues increased, driven by growth in Energy and Natural Resources in Americas and Utilities and Energy in EMEA. Lower client demand for outsourcing services resulted in moderation of outsourcing revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and a shift in the mix of work towards consulting. Geographic Regions•Americas net revenues increased 17% in local currency, led by the United States, Brazil and Canada.•EMEA net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by growth in local currency in most countries, led by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa and Switzerland.•Asia Pacific net revenues increased 23% in local currency, led by Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and India.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for fiscal 2011 were $23,882 million, an increase of $3,703 million, or 18%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.3% from 87.4% during this period.

Gross margin for fiscal 2011 decreased to 32.9% from 33.6% during this period. Our contract profitability for fiscal 2011 was lower than the same period in fiscal 2010, as we continued our efforts to absorb higher annual compensation increases and subcontractor costs with improved pricing and a more efficient resource mix. Gross margin also included the impact of higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a large number of new employees to meet demand.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2011 was $3,094 million, an increase of $436 million, or 16%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.1% from 12.3% during this period.General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2011 were $1,820 million, an increase of $152 million, or 9%, over fiscal 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 7.1% from 7.7% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues, as well as a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services due to better than expected bad debt experience, partially offset by a provision for litigation matters of $75 million.40Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2011 was $3,470 million, an increase of $556 million, or 19%, over fiscal 2010, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 13.6% from 13.5% during this period.

For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:•facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;•acquire complementary businesses or technologies;•take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or•develop new services and solutions.As of August 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents was $6.6 billion, compared with $5.7 billion as of August 31, 2011.Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2012 2011 2010 2012 to 2011Change (1) (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,257 $3,442 $3,092 $815Investing activities(535) (703) (274) 168Financing activities(2,559) (2,122) (2,429) (437)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(223) 246 (92) (469)Net increase in cash and cash equivalents (1)$939 $863 $297 $77_______________ (1)May not total due to rounding.Operating activities: The $815 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues).Investing activities: The $168 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to decreased spending on business acquisitions. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Goodwill) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Financing activities: The $437 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”42Table of ContentsWe believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months, including a discretionary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans that is expected to be funded during the first half of fiscal 2013. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Borrowing FacilitiesAs of August 31, 2012, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: FacilityAmount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions of U.S. dollars)Syndicated loan facility (1)$1,000 $—Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities (2)518 —Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit (3)125 —Total$1,643 $—_______________ (1)On October 31, 2011, we replaced our $1.2 billion syndicated loan facility maturing on July 31, 2012 with a $1.0 billion syndicated loan facility maturing on October 31, 2016.

As of August 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no borrowings under these various facilities.Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $164 million and $178 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $0.03 million and $4.42 million as of August 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.43Table of ContentsShare Purchases and RedemptionsThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former senior executives and their permitted transferees. As of August 31, 2012, our aggregate available authorization was $4,179 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs.Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2012 was as follows: Accenture plc Class AOrdinary Shares Accenture SCA Class ICommon Shares and Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc.

These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.(2)During fiscal 2012, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2013. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.Other Share RedemptionsDuring fiscal 2012, we issued 4,622,450 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by senior executives, former executives and their permitted transferees.Subsequent DevelopmentOn September 24, 2012, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.81 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 12, 2012. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.81 per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2012. Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2012.44Table of ContentsObligations and CommitmentsAs of August 31, 2012, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1)(2) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt $— $— $— $— $—Operating leases 2,118 443 639 387 649Retirement obligations (3) 113 12 23 23 55Purchase obligations and other commitments (4) 213 78 102 33 —Total $2,444 $533 $764 $443 $704 _______________(1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”(2)In fiscal 2001, we accrued reorganization liabilities in connection with our transition to a corporate structure. As of August 31, 2012, the remaining liability for reorganization costs was $269 million, of which $258 million was classified as Other accrued liabilities because expirations of statutes of limitations or other final determinations could occur within 12 months. The reorganization liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Timing of the resolution of tax audits or the initiation of additional litigation and/or criminal tax proceedings may delay final resolution. Final settlement will result in a payment on a final settlement and/or recording a reorganization cost or benefit in our Consolidated Income Statement. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Reorganization Costs, net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”(3)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.(4)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”45Table of ContentsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn March 2012, the Company adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on fair value measurements. The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, i.e. an exit price. Additionally, any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 asset valuation classifications must be disclosed, including the reasons for the transfers. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.New Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network.For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of Services. As of August 31, 2012, it was anticipated that $28 million of the net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into Cost of Services within the next 12 months.We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $402 million and $358 million as of August 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.Interest Rate RiskThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2012 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.Equity Price RiskThe equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 46Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:35:34.309692
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2013” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2013. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.OverviewRevenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, credit market conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in markets around the world, as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide in many of the industries we serve, all of which are impacting, and we expect will continue to impact, our business. These conditions have impacted the types of services our clients are demanding. Clients are requesting a higher volume of outsourcing services and are placing a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and in some cases, slowing the pace and level of spending on existing contracts. These changing demand patterns are currently having an adverse impact on the timing of revenue and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $7.09 billion, compared with $6.84 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, an increase of 3.7% in U.S. dollars and 4.5% in local currency. Net revenues for fiscal 2013 were $28.56 billion, compared with $27.86 billion for fiscal 2012, an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, Health & Public Service, Products, Financial Services and Communications, Media & Technology experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency, while Resources was flat in local currency year-over-year. Revenue growth in local currency was solid in outsourcing, while consulting revenues reflected modest growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was lower than we expected due, in large part, to lower than expected demand, particularly in certain geographies experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions, such as certain countries in Europe and in Brazil. We expect year-over-year revenues to range from a slight decline to a modest increase in the near term and continue to vary across operating groups and geographic regions, with growth in certain areas of our business partially offset by lower growth or declines in other areas.In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $3.80 billion, compared with $3.74 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency. Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2013 were $15.38 billion, compared with $15.56 billion for fiscal 2012, a decrease of 1% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 1% in local currency. Three of our five operating groups, including Health & Public Service, Communications, Media & Technology and Products, experienced quarterly year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency, while Resources and Financial Services experienced declines in quarterly year-over-year consulting revenue. We continued to enter into a higher proportion of contracts with longer duration that are converting to revenue at a slower pace, and clients slowed the pace and level of their spending. We expect these trends to continue in the near term. Clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. We continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including analytics, cloud computing and mobility. Compared to fiscal 2012, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network, and we expect this trend to continue. The business environment is more competitive and, in some areas, we are experiencing pricing pressures.32Table of ContentsIn our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $3.28 billion, compared with $3.10 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, an increase of 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. Net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2013 were $13.18 billion, compared with $12.30 billion for fiscal 2012, an increase of 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency. Health & Public Service, Financial Services and Products experienced strong year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency was slight in Resources and declined in Communications, Media & Technology. Outsourcing revenue growth continued to be moderate, compared to the strong year-over-year growth that we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2013, as some clients slowed the pace and level of their spending and we expect these trends to continue in the near term. Clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. Compared to fiscal 2012, we provided a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower. When compared to fiscal 2012, the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies during fiscal 2013. This resulted in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1% and 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013, respectively. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate the foreign-exchange impact to our fiscal 2014 revenue growth will be 1% lower growth in U.S. dollars than our growth in local currency.The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts. Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on billable work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was approximately 88%, flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2013, and within our target range. This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 275,000 as of August 31, 2013, compared with approximately 266,000 as of May 31, 2013 and approximately 257,000 as of August 31, 2012. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, including those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was 12%, flat with both the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with increases or decreases in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2013 became effective September 1, 2012. As in prior fiscal years, we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing services; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; recover increases in compensation; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was 33.2%, compared with 32.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Gross margin for fiscal 2013 was 32.9%, compared with 32.3% for fiscal 2012. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2013 was principally due to higher outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by higher costs associated with investments in offerings.Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, compared with 19.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.6% for fiscal 2013, compared with 18.4% for fiscal 2012. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business-development activities; investment in offerings; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues increased approximately 30 basis points as a result of higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities, as well as acquisition-related costs. Our margins could 33Table of Contentsbe adversely affected if our cost-management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues.Operating expenses for fiscal 2013 included reorganization benefits of $274 million as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. For additional information, see Note 3 (Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, Net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was $984 million, compared with $940 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Operating income for fiscal 2013 was $4,339 million, compared with $3,872 million for fiscal 2012. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was 13.9% compared with 13.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Operating margin for fiscal 2013 was 15.2%, compared with 13.9% for fiscal 2012. The reorganization benefits of $274 million recorded during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2013 increased operating margin by 100 basis points. Excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin would have been 14.2% for fiscal 2013, an increase of 30 basis points compared with fiscal 2012.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 18.1%. The above noted reorganization benefits increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense. In addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. Absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3% compared with 27.6% in fiscal 2012.Diluted earnings per share were $4.93 for fiscal 2013, compared with $3.84 for fiscal 2012. Absent the above noted reorganization benefits and tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2013, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.21 for fiscal 2013.Our Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Bookings and BacklogNew contract bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $8.40 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.86 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.54 billion. New contract bookings for fiscal 2013 were $33.28 billion, with consulting bookings of $16.27 billion and outsourcing bookings of $17.01 billion.We provide information regarding our new contract bookings because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. However, new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. Clients continue to enter into contracts that are converting to revenue at a slower pace and clients have slowed the pace and level of their spending, all of which impact the conversion of new contract bookings to revenues. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. New contract bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New contract bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.34Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionOur contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered, and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services, and other factors affecting revenues and costs.Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining the vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value of each element. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. If the amount 35Table of Contentsof non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware and software resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware and software resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.Income TaxesDetermining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.36Table of ContentsAs a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.Revenues by Segment/Operating GroupOur five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are: Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Pricing for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.37Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncrease(Decrease)U.S. Dollars PercentIncrease(Decrease)LocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$5,686 $5,907 (4)% (2)% 20% 21%Financial Services6,166 5,843 6 7 21 21Health & Public Service4,739 4,256 11 12 17 15Products6,807 6,563 4 5 24 24Resources5,143 5,275 (2) (1) 18 19Other22 19 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES28,563 27,862 3 % 4 % 100% 100%Reimbursements1,831 1,916 (4) TOTAL REVENUES$30,394 $29,778 2 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Americas$13,519 $12,523 8 % 9 % 47% 45%EMEA (1)11,047 11,296 (2) — 39 41Asia Pacific3,997 4,043 (1) 3 14 14TOTAL NET REVENUES$28,563 $27,862 3 % 4 % 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$15,383 $15,562 (1)% 1 % 54% 56%Outsourcing13,179 12,300 7 9 46 44TOTAL NET REVENUES$28,563 $27,862 3 % 4 % 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningful(1)EMEA includes Europe, Middle East and Africa.(2)Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.We conduct business in the following countries that individually comprised 10% or more of consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011: Fiscal 2013 2012 2011United States39% 36% 35%United Kingdom9 9 10Net RevenuesOutsourcing revenue growth in local currency moderated during the second half of fiscal 2013 compared to the first half of fiscal 2013. Financial Services, Products and Health & Public Service experienced strong growth in outsourcing revenues in local currency during fiscal 2013. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was slight in Resources and declined in Communications, Media & Technology. Consulting revenues were flat in local currency during fiscal 2013. Health & Public Service experienced strong growth in consulting revenues in local currency during fiscal 2013. Consulting revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was slight in Financial Services and declined in Communications, Media & Technology, Resources and Products.38Table of ContentsThe following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012:Operating Groups•Communications, Media & Technology net revenues decreased 2% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected slight growth, driven by growth in Americas across all industry groups and Media & Entertainment in EMEA, partially offset by a significant decline in Electronics & High Tech in EMEA, principally due to an expected year-over-year revenue decline from one contract. The revenue decline on this contract is expected to continue to impact outsourcing revenue growth in the near term. In addition, outsourcing revenue growth was impacted by a decline in Electronics & High Tech in Asia Pacific. Consulting revenues reflected a modest decline, due to declines in Communications and Media & Entertainment in Americas and Electronics & High Tech in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by strong growth in Electronics & High Tech in Americas. Some of our clients continued to reduce and/or defer their investment in consulting, which had a negative impact on our consulting revenues during fiscal 2013. We expect these trends will continue to impact our net revenue growth in the near term.•Financial Services net revenues increased 7% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by all industry groups in Americas and Banking in EMEA, including the impact of an acquisition in Banking during fiscal 2012. Consulting revenues reflected slight growth, with very strong growth driven by Insurance in Americas and Asia Pacific and Capital Markets in EMEA. These increases were partially offset by declines in Insurance and Banking in EMEA and Banking in Americas. Changes in the banking and capital markets industries continue to influence the business needs of our clients. This is resulting in higher current demand for outsourcing services, including transformational projects, and lower demand for short-term consulting services and we expect this trend to continue in the near term.•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 12% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, led by Public Service in Americas and Asia Pacific and Health in Americas and EMEA. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA and Health in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues also reflected strong growth, led by Public Service in Americas and Health in Americas and Asia Pacific.•Products net revenues increased 5% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Life Sciences, Retail and Industrial Equipment. Consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in Asia Pacific across most industry groups, Americas and EMEA in Retail, and Americas in Consumer Goods & Services. These decreases were largely offset by growth in Americas and EMEA in Life Sciences, Americas in Industrial Equipment and EMEA in Consumer Goods & Services. During fiscal 2013, several large systems integration projects ended, transitioned to smaller phases or to outsourcing services. We also had higher demand for outsourcing services, including transformational projects, and lower demand for short-term consulting services and we expect this trend to continue in the near term.•Resources net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected modest growth, driven by all industry groups in EMEA and Utilities and Energy in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in Utilities in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected a modest decline, as growth in Chemicals across all geographic regions was more than offset by declines in Natural Resources in Asia Pacific and Americas, Utilities in EMEA and Energy in Americas. Some of our clients, primarily in Natural Resources and Utilities, reduced their level of consulting investments. In addition, several large systems integration projects have ended or have transitioned to smaller phases and demand for our outsourcing services has moderated. We expect these trends will continue to impact Resources year-over-year net revenue growth in the near term.Geographic Regions•Americas net revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by growth in the United States.•EMEA net revenues were flat in local currency. We experienced a significant decline in Finland, principally due to an expected year-over-year decline from one contract in Communications, Media & Technology, as well as declines in Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These declines were offset by growth in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, South Africa and Italy.•Asia Pacific net revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by China, India, Singapore and Australia, partially offset by declines in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for fiscal 2013 were $26,056 million, an increase of $149 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.7% from 87.0% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2013 were $24,224 million, an increase of $233 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 84.8% from 86.1% during this period.39Table of ContentsCost of ServicesCost of services for fiscal 2013 was $21,010 million, an increase of $220 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.1% from 69.8% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2013 was $19,179 million, an increase of $304 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.1% from 67.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2013 increased to 32.9% from 32.3% during this period, principally due to higher outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by higher costs associated with investments in offerings.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2013 was $3,482 million, an increase of $178 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2012, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.2% from 11.9% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities, as well as acquisition-related costs.General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2013 were $1,836 million, an increase of $25 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.4% from 6.5% during this period.Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, netWe recorded net reorganization benefits of $272 million ($274 million in reorganization benefits less $1.9 million in interest expense accrued) during fiscal 2013 as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, Net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Operating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2013 was $4,339 million, an increase of $467 million, or 12%, over fiscal 2012, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 15.2% from 13.9% during this period. The reorganization benefits of $274 million recorded during fiscal 2013 increased operating margin by 100 basis points. Excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2013 increased 30 basis points compared to fiscal 2012.

The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2013, exclusive of the reorganization benefits, compared with fiscal 2012. See “Reorganization (Benefits), Costs, net.”•Communications, Media & Technology operating income decreased, primarily due to a decline in consulting revenue and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. Operating income was also impacted by an expected significant year-over-year revenue decline from one outsourcing contract.•Financial Services operating income increased, primarily due to strong outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing and consulting contract profitability. Operating income for fiscal 2012 included the impact of costs related to acquisitions.•Health & Public Service operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract profitability.•Products operating income increased, primarily due to strong outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by a decline in consulting revenues.•Resources operating income decreased, primarily due to a decline in consulting revenue and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.Interest IncomeInterest income for fiscal 2013 was $33 million, a decrease of $10 million, or 23%, from fiscal 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances.Other (Expense) Income, netOther (expense) income, net for fiscal 2013 was $18 million, a decrease of $23 million from fiscal 2012. The change was primarily driven by net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2013, compared to net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 18.1%, compared with 27.6% for fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased income before taxes without any increase in income tax expense. The effective tax rate was also impacted by a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 recorded during fiscal 2013. Absent these items, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3%, which is lower than fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower additions to tax reserves.41Table of ContentsNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2013 was $273 million, an increase of $1 million over fiscal 2012. The increase was due to higher Net income of $730 million, offset by a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 7% for fiscal 2013 from 9% for fiscal 2012.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $4.93 for fiscal 2013, compared with $3.84 for fiscal 2012. The $1.09 increase in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased earnings per share by $0.38, and the $243 million tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits, which increased earnings per share by $0.34. Excluding the impact of these benefits, earnings per share increased $0.37 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2012, due to increases of $0.19 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.13 from a lower effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits and reorganization benefits, and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 from lower non-operating income. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”42Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncreaseU.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2012 2011 2012 2011 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$5,907 $5,434 9% 11% 21% 22%Financial Services5,843 5,381 9 11 21 21Health & Public Service4,256 3,861 10 11 15 15Products6,563 5,931 11 13 24 23Resources5,275 4,882 8 10 19 19Other19 18 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES27,862 25,507 9% 11% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,916 1,846 4 TOTAL REVENUES$29,778 $27,353 9% GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Americas$12,523 $11,271 11% 13% 45% 44%EMEA11,296 10,854 4 8 41 43Asia Pacific4,043 3,383 20 18 14 13TOTAL NET REVENUES$27,862 $25,507 9% 11% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$15,562 $14,924 4% 6% 56% 59%Outsourcing12,300 10,583 16 19 44 41TOTAL NET REVENUES$27,862 $25,507 9% 11% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningful(1)Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Net RevenuesRevenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing during fiscal 2012. All five of our operating groups experienced double-digit year-over-year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2012. Consulting revenue growth in local currency moderated significantly during the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012. While Health & Public Service experienced strong growth in consulting revenues in local currency during fiscal 2012, year-over-year consulting revenue growth in local currency either moderated or declined for all other operating groups in the second half of fiscal 2012.The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011:Operating Groups•Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, led by Electronics & High Tech in EMEA, principally due to a significant short-term increase from one contract. We also experienced outsourcing growth in Communications across all geographic regions. Consulting revenues declined slightly, with growth in the first half of fiscal 2012 offset by contraction during the second half of the fiscal year. For fiscal 2012, consulting revenues reflected a decline in Communications in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Media & Entertainment in Americas and Electronics & High Tech in Asia Pacific. Some of our clients, primarily in Communications, continued to exercise caution by reducing and/or deferring their investment in consulting, which had a negative impact on our consulting revenues.43Table of Contents•Financial Services net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth, driven by all industry groups in Americas, including the impact of an acquisition in Banking. We also experienced outsourcing growth across all industry groups in Asia Pacific and Capital Markets in EMEA. Consulting revenues reflected modest growth, driven by significant growth in Insurance across all geographic regions, including the impact of an acquisition. This growth was partially offset by declines in Banking in EMEA and Americas and Capital Markets in EMEA. The uncertainty in the banking and capital markets industries impacted our consulting revenue growth during fiscal 2012.•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, led by Health across all geographic regions and Public Service in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by Health across all geographic regions and Public Service in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues during fiscal 2011 reflected revenues recognized upon favorable resolution of billing holdbacks on certain contracts with United States government agencies. The global uncertainty and challenges in the public sector continued to have an impact on demand in our public service business.•Products net revenues increased 13% in local currency. Consulting revenues increased, driven primarily by growth across all industry groups in Americas and most industry groups in Asia Pacific. By industry group, growth was led by Retail and Industrial Equipment. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and most industry groups, led by Life Sciences, Air, Freight & Travel Services and Retail.•Resources net revenues increased 10% in local currency.

Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and all industry groups, led by Energy and Natural Resources. Geographic Regions•Americas net revenues increased 13% in local currency, led by the United States and Brazil. In general, revenue growth moderated across Americas in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012.•EMEA net revenues increased 8% in local currency, driven by growth in Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and South Africa. In general, revenue growth moderated across EMEA in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the first half of fiscal 2012.•Asia Pacific net revenues increased 18% in local currency, driven by Australia, Japan, China, Singapore, South Korea and India.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $25,906 million, an increase of $2,024 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 87.0% from 87.3% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2012 were $23,991 million, an increase of $1,954 million, or 9%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.1% from 86.4% during this period.Cost of ServicesCost of services for fiscal 2012 was $20,790 million, an increase of $1,824 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.8% from 69.3% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2012 was $18,875 million, an increase of $1,754 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.7% from 67.1% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 decreased to 32.3% from 32.9% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was lower than for fiscal 2011, principally due to higher payroll costs as a percentage of net revenues, including costs associated with investments in offerings and acquisitions, partially offset by higher contract profitability.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 was $3,303 million, an increase of $209 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.9% from 12.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to growth of business development costs at a rate lower than that of net revenues.General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2012 were $1,811 million, a decrease of $9 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.5% from 7.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was due to management of these costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues. In addition, during fiscal 2011, we recorded a provision for litigation matters for $75 million, or 0.3% of net revenues, which was partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services.44Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2012 was $3,872 million, an increase of $401 million, or 12%, over fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 13.9% from 13.6% during this period. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2012 2011 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin Increase(Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology$845 14% $728 13% $118Financial Services810 14 898 17 (89)Health & Public Service376 9 318 8 58Products864 13 680 11 184Resources977 19 846 17 130Total$3,872 13.9% $3,470 13.6% $401 _______________ (1) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.During fiscal 2012, the results of each operating group benefited from our management of general and administrative costs at a growth rate lower than that of net revenues. In addition, during fiscal 2011, each operating group recorded a portion of the $75 million provision for litigation matters, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance for client receivables and unbilled services. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, exclusive of these impacts.•Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased, primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth, principally related to a significant short-term increase from one contract.•Financial Services operating income decreased, primarily due to a lower proportion of high margin consulting work, costs related to recent acquisitions and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by strong outsourcing revenue growth.•Health & Public Service operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by the negative impact of delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts. Health & Public Service operating margin was impacted by administrative and compliance costs associated with our U.S. Federal practice.•Products operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and improved consulting and outsourcing contract profitability.•Resources operating income increased, primarily due to strong revenue growth.Interest IncomeInterest income for fiscal 2012 was $43 million, an increase of $1 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher cash balances.Other Income, netOther income, net for fiscal 2012 was $5 million, a decrease of $10 million from fiscal 2011. The change was driven primarily by lower net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 27.6%, compared with 27.3% for fiscal 2011. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 included higher expenses for additions to tax reserves and changes in our geographic mix of income, partially offset by higher benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities.45Table of ContentsNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2012 was $271 million, a decrease of $4 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2011. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 9% for fiscal 2012 from 10% for fiscal 2011, partially offset by an increase in Net income of $272 million.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $3.84 for fiscal 2012, compared with $3.39 for fiscal 2011. The $0.45 increase in our earnings per share was due to increases of $0.40 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from a higher effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower non-operating income, compared with fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the impact of the issuance of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units in connection with the fiscal 2012 payment of cash dividends. This restatement resulted in a one cent decrease in diluted earnings per share from $3.40 to $3.39 for fiscal 2011. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:•facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;•acquire complementary businesses or technologies;•take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or•develop new services and solutions.As of August 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents was $5.6 billion, compared with $6.6 billion as of August 31, 2012.Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2013 2012 2011 2013 to 2012 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,303 $4,257 $3,442 $(954)Investing activities(1,156) (535) (703) (621)Financing activities(3,066) (2,559) (2,122) (507)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(90) (223) 246 133Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(1,009) $939 $863 $(1,948)_______________ (1)Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Operating activities: The reduction in operating cash flow included the impact of a discretionary cash contribution of $500 million made to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan during fiscal 2013, which had a net impact of $350 million, after tax. The reduction in operating cash flow was also due to other changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by higher net income.Investing activities: The $621 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on business acquisitions. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Goodwill) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”46Table of ContentsFinancing activities: The $507 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of ordinary shares and an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Borrowing FacilitiesAs of August 31, 2013, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: FacilityAmount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions of U.S. dollars)Syndicated loan facility (1)$1,000 $—Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities (2)508 —Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit (3)170 —Total$1,678 $—_______________ (1)This facility, which matures on October 31, 2016, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of August 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no borrowings under the facility.(2)We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no borrowings under these facilities.(3)We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no borrowings under these various facilities.Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $179 million and $164 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $25.60 million and $0.03 million as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.47Table of ContentsShare Purchases and RedemptionsThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. As of August 31, 2013, our aggregate available authorization was $1,964 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs.Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2013 was as follows: Accenture plc Class AOrdinary Shares Accenture SCA Class ICommon Shares and Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts)Open-market share purchases (1)26,547,155 $1,997 — $—Other share purchase programs— — 3,062,148 218Other purchases (2)4,750,122 330 — —Total31,297,277 $2,326 3,062,148 $218 _______________(1)We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.(2)During fiscal 2013, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.(3)Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2014. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.Other Share RedemptionsDuring fiscal 2013, we issued 11,019,187 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.Subsequent DevelopmentsOn September 25, 2013, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.93 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 11, 2013. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.93 per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 8, 2013. Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2013.On September 25, 2013, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $5.0 billion in additional share repurchase authority bringing Accenture’s total outstanding authority to approximately $6.96 billion.48Table of ContentsObligations and CommitmentsAs of August 31, 2013, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt $32 $— $2 $6 $25Operating leases 2,160 455 649 383 675Retirement obligations (2) 111 12 23 23 54Purchase obligations and other commitments (3) 231 171 53 5 2Total $2,534 $637 $726 $416 $755 _______________(1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”(2)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.(3)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.(4)Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”49Table of ContentsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn August 2013, we early adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) which requires enhanced disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to present separately, by item, reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The early adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information related to the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”In September 2012, we adopted guidance issued by the FASB which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change in the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, which are now presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income rather than in the Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity Statements, under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance for our fiscal 2013 annual goodwill impairment test. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”New Accounting PronouncementIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of offset, amounts offset and the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for Accenture beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time we will include the required disclosures.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2013, it was anticipated that $177 million of the net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. 50Table of ContentsWe use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $309 million and $402 million as of August 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Interest Rate RiskThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2013 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.Equity Price RiskThe equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 17:35:33.100526
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2014,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2014” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2014. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.OverviewRevenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in certain markets around the world, as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide, all of which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $7.78 billion, compared with $7.09 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency. Net revenues for fiscal 2014 were $30.00 billion, compared with $28.56 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of 5% in both U.S. dollars and local currency. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Communications, Media & Technology, Products, Health & Public Service and Financial Services experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency, while Resources was flat year-over-year in local currency. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and modest in consulting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Clients continue to request a higher volume of outsourcing services, place a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and manage the pace and level of spending on existing consulting and outsourcing contracts. The business environment remains competitive and, in the first half of fiscal 2014, we experienced pricing pressures. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $4.02 billion, compared with $3.80 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 6% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2014 were $15.74 billion, compared with $15.38 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency. Clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. We continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including digital services (digital marketing, analytics and mobility) and cloud computing. Compared to fiscal 2013, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. This trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue, and we expect this trend to continue. In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $3.76 billion, compared with $3.28 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2014 were $14.26 billion, compared with $13.18 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of 8% in both U.S. dollars and local currency. Clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. Compared to fiscal 2013, we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be lower. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in U.S. dollars may be higher. When compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1% higher than our revenue growth in 28Table of Contentslocal currency. When compared to fiscal 2013, there was no aggregate foreign currency translation impact during fiscal 2014, resulting in U.S. dollar revenue growth that was the same as our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. Cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts. Utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals’ time spent on chargeable work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was approximately 88%, flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and within our target range. This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand.We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to more than 305,000 as of August 31, 2014, compared with approximately 293,000 as of May 31, 2014 and approximately 275,000 as of August 31, 2013. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, primarily those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 15%, up from 14% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and 12% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2014 became effective September 1, 2013. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing and emerging technology services; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 31.7%, compared with 33.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Gross margin for fiscal 2014 was 32.3%, compared with 32.9% for fiscal 2013. There were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during fiscal 2014. We experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases and/or rebalance the mix of resources. In addition, we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts. While we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014, the amounts accrued are lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, compared with 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.0% for fiscal 2014, compared with 18.6% for fiscal 2013. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business-development activities; investment in offerings; marketing-and advertising-related activities; and acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs each decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of net revenues. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was $1,079 million, compared with $984 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Operating income for fiscal 2014 was $4,301 million, compared with $4,339 million for fiscal 2013. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 13.9%, flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Operating margin for fiscal 2014 was 14.3%, compared with 15.2% for fiscal 2013. We recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million during fiscal 2013 which increased operating margin by 100 basis points. Excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2013 would have been 14.2%.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 26.1%, compared with 18.1% for fiscal 2013. The above noted reorganization benefits recorded during fiscal 2013 increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense. In addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. Absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.52 for fiscal 2014, compared with $4.93 for fiscal 2013, which included $0.72 in benefits from final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities and reductions in reorganization liabilities. Excluding these benefits, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2013 would have been $4.21.29Table of ContentsOur Operating income and Earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 8 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Bookings and BacklogNew bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $8.33 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.95 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.38 billion. New bookings for fiscal 2014 were $35.88 billion, with consulting bookings of $17.15 billion and outsourcing bookings of $18.73 billion.We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.30Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionOur contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. The selling price of each element is determined by obtaining third party evidence of fair value of each element and is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the Company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered 31Table of Contentselement accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements.Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.Income TaxesDetermining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with FASB guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings.As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities 32Table of Contentsand historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.Revenues by Segment/Operating GroupOur five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.33Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncrease(Decrease)U.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$5,924 $5,686 4 % 5% 20% 20%Financial Services6,511 6,166 6 5 22 21Health & Public Service5,022 4,739 6 7 17 17Products7,395 6,807 9 8 24 24Resources5,135 5,143 — 1 17 18Other15 22 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES30,002 28,563 5 % 5% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,872 1,831 2 TOTAL REVENUES$31,875 $30,394 5 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Americas$14,201 $13,519 5 % 6% 47% 47%EMEA (1)11,915 11,047 8 4 40 39Asia Pacific3,886 3,997 (3) 4 13 14TOTAL NET REVENUES$30,002 $28,563 5 % 5% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$15,738 $15,383 2 % 3% 52% 54%Outsourcing14,265 13,179 8 8 48 46TOTAL NET REVENUES$30,002 $28,563 5 % 5% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Our business in the United States represented 40%, 39% and 36% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods. Net RevenuesThe following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013:Operating Groups•Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 5% in local currency. Outsourcing revenue growth was driven by all industry groups in Americas and Electronics & High Tech in Asia Pacific. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Electronics & High Tech in EMEA. Consulting revenues reflected modest growth, led by Electronics & High Tech in Americas and EMEA, partially offset by declines in Communications across all geographic regions.•Financial Services net revenues increased 5% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by all industry groups in EMEA and Asia Pacific and Capital Markets in Americas. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Insurance in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in Insurance in EMEA and Americas, partially offset by growth in Banking in EMEA and Asia Pacific. While fiscal 2014 consulting net revenues reflected a slight decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2014 partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2014.34Table of Contents•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, led by Health and Public Service in Americas, partially offset by a decline in Health in EMEA. Consulting revenues reflected modest growth, driven by Public Service and Health in Americas and Public Service in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA.•Products net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions in most industry groups, led by Air, Freight & Travel Services and Life Sciences in Americas and Retail in EMEA. These increases were partially offset by declines in Retail in Americas, and Consumer Goods & Services and Air, Freight & Travel Services in EMEA. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, driven by most industry groups in EMEA, led by Retail, Consumer Goods & Services and Auto, and in Americas, led by Consumer Goods & Services and Air, Freight & Travel Services. This growth was partially offset by declines in Retail in Asia Pacific and Americas.•Resources net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected modest growth, driven by Energy in Americas and Utilities in EMEA, partially offset by a decline in Utilities in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in Natural Resources across all geographic regions and Energy in Americas, partially offset by growth in Energy in Asia Pacific and EMEA, Utilities in EMEA and Chemicals in Americas. Some of our clients, primarily in Natural Resources, continued to reduce their level of consulting investments. In addition, several large systems integration projects have ended or have transitioned to smaller phases and demand for our services has moderated. We expect these trends will continue to impact Resources year-over-year net revenue growth in the near term.Geographic Regions•Americas net revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by the United States, partially offset by a decline in Canada.•EMEA net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany and Norway. These increases were partially offset by declines in Spain, South Africa and Finland.•Asia Pacific net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by Japan and to a lesser extent India, partially offset by declines in Singapore and South Korea.In fiscal 2015, we will begin reporting our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada); Europe; and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey). See Item 9B, “Other Information” for fiscal 2014 and 2013 net revenues aligned with these revised geographic regions. Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for fiscal 2014 were $27,574 million, an increase of $1,519 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 86.5% from 85.7% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2014 were $25,702 million, an increase of $1,478 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 85.7% from 84.8% during this period. Operating expenses for fiscal 2013 included reorganization benefits of $274 million as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001.Cost of ServicesCost of services for fiscal 2014 was $22,190 million, an increase of $1,180 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.6% from 69.1% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2014 was $20,318 million, an increase of $1,139 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.7% from 67.1% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2014 decreased to 32.3% from 32.9% during this period. There were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during fiscal 2014. We experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases and/or rebalance the mix of resources. In addition, we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts. While we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014, the amounts accrued are lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014 was $3,583 million, an increase of $101 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.9% from 12.2% during this period. General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2014 were $1,819 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.1% from 6.4% during this period. 35Table of ContentsReorganization (Benefits) Costs, netWe recorded net reorganization benefits of $272 million ($274 million in reorganization benefits less $1.9 million in interest expense accrued) during fiscal 2013 as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, Net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Operating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2014 was $4,301 million, a decrease of $38 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 14.3% from 15.2% during this period. During fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased operating margin by 100 basis points. Excluding the effects of the fiscal 2013 reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2014 increased 10 basis points compared to fiscal 2013. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2014 2013 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin (in millions of U.S. dollars)Communications, Media & Technology$770 13% $786 14%Financial Services957 15 1,003 16Health & Public Service679 14 594 13Products992 13 985 14Resources902 18 971 19Total$4,301 14.3% $4,339 15.2% _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Fiscal 2013 Reorganization Benefits (Non-GAAP) Fiscal 2014 2013 Operating Income and Operating Margin as Reported (GAAP) Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Reorganization Benefits (Non-GAAP) OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome(GAAP) Reorganization Benefits (1) Operating Income (2) OperatingMargin (2) Increase(Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars)Communications, Media & Technology$770 13% $786 $53 $733 13% $37Financial Services957 15 1,003 59 944 15 13Health & Public Service679 14 594 48 546 12 132Products992 13 985 65 921 14 71Resources902 18 971 49 921 18 (19)Total$4,301 14.3% $4,339 $274 $4,065 14.2% $236_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)Represents reorganization benefits related to final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure during 2001. (2)We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding reorganization benefits, as we believe the effect of the reorganization benefits on Operating income and operating margin facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these benefits and our operating performance.36Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2014, the financial results of each operating group benefited from a reduction in variable compensation compared to fiscal 2013. The commentary below provides additional insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, exclusive of the reorganization benefit recorded in fiscal 2013: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income was impacted by lower contract profitability, including early-stage work at lower margins on a few large contracts. Operating income was favorably impacted by revenue growth.•Financial Services operating income was impacted by lower contract profitability, including early-stage work at lower margins on a few large outsourcing contracts. Operating income was favorably impacted by outsourcing revenue growth.•Health & Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth.•Products operating income was impacted by lower consulting contract profitability, including delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts. Operating income was favorably impacted by revenue growth.•Resources operating income was impacted by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. Operating income was favorably impacted by higher outsourcing contract profitability.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 26.1%, compared with 18.1% for fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense. In addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. Absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3%. The higher effective tax rate during fiscal 2014 is primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2014 was $234 million, a decrease of $38 million, or 14%, from fiscal 2013. The decrease was due to lower Net income of $379 million and a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 6% for fiscal 2014 from 7% for fiscal 2013.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $4.52 for fiscal 2014, compared with $4.93 for fiscal 2013. The $0.41 decrease in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by $0.38, and the $243 million tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits, which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by $0.34. Excluding the impact of these benefits, earnings per share for fiscal 2014 increased $0.31 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2013, due to increases of $0.25 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.12 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.06 from a higher effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits and reorganization benefits. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”37Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncrease(Decrease)U.S. Dollars PercentIncrease(Decrease)LocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$5,686 $5,907 (4)% (2)% 20% 21%Financial Services6,166 5,843 6 7 21 21Health & Public Service4,739 4,256 11 12 17 15Products6,807 6,563 4 5 24 24Resources5,143 5,275 (2) (1) 18 19Other22 19 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES28,563 27,862 3 % 4 % 100% 100%Reimbursements1,831 1,916 (4) TOTAL REVENUES$30,394 $29,778 2 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Americas$13,519 $12,523 8 % 9 % 47% 45%EMEA (1)11,047 11,296 (2) — 39 41Asia Pacific3,997 4,043 (1) 3 14 14TOTAL NET REVENUES$28,563 $27,862 3 % 4 % 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$15,383 $15,562 (1)% 1 % 54% 56%Outsourcing13,179 12,300 7 9 46 44TOTAL NET REVENUES$28,563 $27,862 3 % 4 % 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Net RevenuesOutsourcing revenue growth in local currency moderated during the second half of fiscal 2013 compared to the first half of fiscal 2013. Financial Services, Products and Health & Public Service experienced strong growth in outsourcing revenues in local currency during fiscal 2013. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was slight in Resources and declined in Communications, Media & Technology. Consulting revenues were flat in local currency during fiscal 2013. Health & Public Service experienced strong growth in consulting revenues in local currency during fiscal 2013. Consulting revenue growth in local currency during fiscal 2013 was slight in Financial Services and declined in Communications, Media & Technology, Resources and Products.The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012:Operating Groups•Communications, Media & Technology net revenues decreased 2% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected slight growth, driven by growth in Americas across all industry groups and Media & Entertainment in EMEA, partially offset by a significant decline in Electronics & High Tech in EMEA, principally due to an expected year-over-year revenue decline from one contract. In addition, outsourcing revenue growth was impacted by a decline in Electronics & High Tech in Asia Pacific. Consulting revenues reflected a modest decline, due to declines in Communications and Media & Entertainment in Americas and Electronics & High Tech in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by strong growth in Electronics & High Tech in Americas. Some of our clients continued to reduce and/or defer their investment in consulting, which had a negative impact on our consulting revenues during fiscal 2013. 38Table of Contents•Financial Services net revenues increased 7% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by all industry groups in Americas and Banking in EMEA, including the impact of an acquisition in Banking during fiscal 2012. Consulting revenues reflected slight growth, with very strong growth driven by Insurance in Americas and Asia Pacific and Capital Markets in EMEA. These increases were partially offset by declines in Insurance and Banking in EMEA and Banking in Americas. Changes in the banking and capital markets industries continued to influence the business needs of our clients. This resulted in higher demand for outsourcing services, including transformational projects, and lower demand for short-term consulting services.•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 12% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, led by Public Service in Americas and Asia Pacific and Health in Americas and EMEA. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA and Health in Asia Pacific. Outsourcing revenues also reflected strong growth, led by Public Service in Americas and Health in Americas and Asia Pacific.•Products net revenues increased 5% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions and industry groups, led by Life Sciences, Retail and Industrial Equipment. Consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in Asia Pacific across most industry groups, Americas and EMEA in Retail, and Americas in Consumer Goods & Services. These decreases were largely offset by growth in Americas and EMEA in Life Sciences, Americas in Industrial Equipment and EMEA in Consumer Goods & Services. During fiscal 2013, several large systems integration projects ended, transitioned to smaller phases or to outsourcing services. We also had higher demand for outsourcing services, including transformational projects, and lower demand for short-term consulting services.•Resources net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected modest growth, driven by all industry groups in EMEA and Utilities and Energy in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in Utilities in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected a modest decline, as growth in Chemicals across all geographic regions was more than offset by declines in Natural Resources in Asia Pacific and Americas, Utilities in EMEA and Energy in Americas. Some of our clients, primarily in Natural Resources and Utilities, reduced their level of consulting investments. In addition, several large systems integration projects ended or transitioned to smaller phases and demand for our outsourcing services moderated.Geographic Regions•Americas net revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by growth in the United States.•EMEA net revenues were flat in local currency. We experienced a significant decline in Finland, principally due to an expected year-over-year decline from one contract in Communications, Media & Technology, as well as declines in Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These declines were offset by growth in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, South Africa and Italy.•Asia Pacific net revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by China, India, Singapore and Australia, partially offset by declines in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for fiscal 2013 were $26,056 million, an increase of $149 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.7% from 87.0% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2013 were $24,224 million, an increase of $233 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 84.8% from 86.1% during this period.Cost of ServicesCost of services for fiscal 2013 was $21,010 million, an increase of $220 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.1% from 69.8% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2013 was $19,179 million, an increase of $304 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.1% from 67.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2013 increased to 32.9% from 32.3% during this period, principally due to higher outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by higher costs associated with investments in offerings.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2013 was $3,482 million, an increase of $178 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2012, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 12.2% from 11.9% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities, as well as acquisition-related costs.39Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2013 were $1,836 million, an increase of $25 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2012, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.4% from 6.5% during this period.Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, netWe recorded net reorganization benefits of $272 million ($274 million in reorganization benefits less $1.9 million in interest expense accrued) during fiscal 2013 as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. For additional information, refer to Note 3 (Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, Net) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Operating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2013 was $4,339 million, an increase of $467 million, or 12%, over fiscal 2012, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 15.2% from 13.9% during this period. The reorganization benefits of $274 million recorded during fiscal 2013 increased operating margin by 100 basis points. Excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2013 increased 30 basis points compared to fiscal 2012. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2013 2012 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin (in millions of U.S. dollars)Communications, Media & Technology$786 14% $845 14%Financial Services1,003 16 810 14Health & Public Service594 13 376 9Products985 14 864 13Resources971 19 977 19Total$4,339 15.2% $3,872 13.9%Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Fiscal 2013 Reorganization Benefits (Non-GAAP) Fiscal 2013 2012 Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Reorganization Benefits (Non-GAAP) Operating Income and Operating Margin as Reported (GAAP) OperatingIncome(GAAP) Reorganization Benefits (1) Operating Income (2) OperatingMargin (2) OperatingIncome OperatingMargin Increase(Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars)Communications, Media & Technology$786 $53 $733 13% $845 14% $(113)Financial Services1,003 59 944 15 810 14 134Health & Public Service594 48 546 12 376 9 170Products985 65 921 14 864 13 57Resources971 49 921 18 977 19 (55)Total$4,339 $274 $4,065 14.2% $3,872 13.9% $193_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)Represents reorganization benefits related to final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure during 2001. (2)We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding reorganization benefits, as we believe quantifying the effect of the reorganization benefits on Operating income and operating margin facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these benefits and our operating performance.40Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2013, each operating group recorded a portion of the $274 million reorganization benefits. The commentary below provides additional insight into operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2013, exclusive of the reorganization benefits, compared with fiscal 2012. See “Reorganization (Benefits), Costs, net.”•Communications, Media & Technology operating income decreased, primarily due to a decline in consulting revenue and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. Operating income was also impacted by an expected significant year-over-year revenue decline from one outsourcing contract.•Financial Services operating income increased, primarily due to strong outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing and consulting contract profitability. Operating income for fiscal 2012 included the impact of costs related to acquisitions.•Health & Public Service operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract profitability.•Products operating income increased, primarily due to strong outsourcing revenue growth and improved outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by a decline in consulting revenues.•Resources operating income decreased, primarily due to a decline in consulting revenue and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.Interest IncomeInterest income for fiscal 2013 was $33 million, a decrease of $10 million, or 23%, from fiscal 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances.Other (Expense) Income, netOther (expense) income, net for fiscal 2013 was $18 million, a decrease of $23 million from fiscal 2012. The change was primarily driven by net foreign exchange losses during fiscal 2013, compared to net foreign exchange gains during fiscal 2012.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 18.1%, compared with 27.6% for fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased income before taxes without any increase in income tax expense. The effective tax rate was also impacted by a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 recorded during fiscal 2013. Absent these items, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3%, which is lower than fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower additions to tax reserves.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture SCA and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2013 was $273 million, an increase of $1 million over fiscal 2012. The increase was due to higher Net income of $730 million, offset by a reduction in the Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 7% for fiscal 2013 from 9% for fiscal 2012.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $4.93 for fiscal 2013, compared with $3.84 for fiscal 2012. The $1.09 increase in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased earnings per share by $0.38, and the $243 million tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits, which increased earnings per share by $0.34. Excluding the impact of these benefits, earnings per share increased $0.37 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2012, due to increases of $0.19 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.13 from a lower effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits and reorganization benefits, and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 from lower non-operating income. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”41Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:•facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;•acquire complementary businesses or technologies;•take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or•develop new services and solutions.As of August 31, 2014, Cash and cash equivalents was $4.9 billion, compared with $5.6 billion as of August 31, 2013.Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2014 2013 2012 2014 to 2013 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,486 $3,303 $4,257 $183Investing activities(1,056) (1,156) (535) 100Financing activities(3,165) (3,066) (2,559) (100)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents25 (90) (223) 115Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(711) $(1,009) $939 $298_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Operating activities: The year-over-year improvement in operating cash flow was primarily due to a discretionary cash contribution of $500 million made to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2013, which had a net impact of $350 million, after tax. This increase was partially offset by lower collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues) and higher current year operational spending. Investing activities: The $100 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Financing activities: The $100 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 14 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.42Table of ContentsBorrowing FacilitiesAs of August 31, 2014, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: FacilityAmount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions of U.S. dollars)Syndicated loan facility (1)$1,000 $—Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities (2)563 —Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit (3)170 —Total$1,733 $—_______________ (1)This facility, which matures on October 31, 2016, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of August 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no borrowings under the facility.(2)We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no borrowings under these facilities.(3)We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no borrowings under these various facilities.Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $170 million and $179 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $27 million and $26 million as of August 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Share Purchases and RedemptionsThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by our current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. As of August 31, 2014, our aggregate available authorization was $4,746 million for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and these other share purchase programs.Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2014 was as follows: Accenture plc Class AOrdinary Shares Accenture SCA Class ICommon Shares and Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts)Open-market share purchases (1)26,217,214 $2,062 — $—Other share purchase programs— — 1,969,382 156Other purchases (2)4,411,320 342 — —Total30,628,534 $2,403 1,969,382 $156 _______________Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)We conduct a publicly announced, open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.(2)During fiscal 2014, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.43Table of ContentsWe intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2015. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.Other Share RedemptionsDuring fiscal 2014, we issued 1,242,209 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture SCA Class I common shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture SCA Class I common shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.Subsequent DevelopmentOn September 23, 2014, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 17, 2014. Accenture plc will cause Accenture SCA to declare a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share on its Class I common shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 14, 2014. Both dividends are payable on November 17, 2014.44Table of ContentsObligations and CommitmentsAs of August 31, 2014, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt $33 $— $5 $6 $21Operating leases 2,164 482 686 388 608Retirement obligations (2) 107 11 22 22 52Purchase obligations and other commitments (3) 199 138 61 — —Total $2,503 $631 $774 $417 $681 _______________Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”(2)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.(3)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.Typically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us in connection with arrangements where third party nonperformance has given rise to the client’s claim. Payments by us under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”45Table of ContentsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementIn September 2013, we adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), which requires enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements. The guidance also requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of offset, amounts of offset and the related net exposure. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information related to master netting arrangements, see Note 8 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”New Accounting PronouncementOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real, U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound and U.S. dollar/Swiss franc—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network. For additional information, see Note 8 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2014, it was anticipated that $20 million of the net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $259 million and $309 million as of August 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Interest Rate RiskThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2014 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.Equity Price RiskThe equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.46Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:35:33.604483

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2015” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2015. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.OverviewRevenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in certain markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There continues to be significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and we expect will continue to have a material effect on our financial results. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Net revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to fiscal 2014. Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. All of our operating groups experienced quarterly year-over-year revenue growth in local currency. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable and we saw improvement in certain areas of our business. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to fiscal 2014. We continue to experience growing demand for digital-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. Compared to fiscal 2014, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. This trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue in our systems integration business, and we expect this trend to continue. In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 9% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to fiscal 2014. We are experiencing growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and operation and maintenance of digital-related services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. Compared to fiscal 2014, we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. When compared to the same periods in fiscal 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against many currencies during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 10% and 7.5% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. 27Table of ContentsThe primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. Effective September 1, 2014, we updated the methodology we use to calculate utilization to include all billable employees’ time spent on chargeable work. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 90%, flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2015. This level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our Global Delivery Network and in most countries. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to more than 358,000 as of August 31, 2015, compared to more than 336,000 as of May 31, 2015 and more than 305,000 as of August 31, 2014. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, primarily those delivered through our Global Delivery Network in lower-cost locations, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 14%, down from 15% in both the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 31.7%, flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Gross margin for fiscal 2015 was 31.6%, compared with 32.3% for fiscal 2014. The reduction in gross margin for fiscal 2015 was principally due to higher labor costs, increased usage of subcontractors and higher non-payroll costs including recruiting and training costs from the addition of a larger number of employees compared to fiscal 2014. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.1% for fiscal 2015, compared with 18.0% for fiscal 2014. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 60 basis points principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities. General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 30 basis points. Operating expenses in fiscal 2015 included a non-cash pension settlement charge of $64 million related to lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 13.9%, flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Operating margin for fiscal 2015 was 14.3%, flat with fiscal 2014. The pension settlement charge of $64 million recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased operating margin by 20 basis points for fiscal 2015. Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin would have been 14.5% for fiscal 2015, an increase of 20 basis points compared with fiscal 2014.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 25.8%, compared with 26.1% for fiscal 2014. Absent the tax impact of the $64 million pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate would have been 26.0% for fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with $4.52 for fiscal 2014. The pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.06 in fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.82 for fiscal 2015.We have also presented Operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the non-cash pension settlement charge, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of this charge and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period. 28Table of ContentsOur Operating income and Earnings per share are affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Bookings and BacklogNew bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 were $8.81 billion, with consulting bookings of $4.08 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.73 billion. New bookings for fiscal 2015 were $34.36 billion, with consulting bookings of $16.70 billion and outsourcing bookings of $17.66 billion.We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.29Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionOur contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable.We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities.Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned.Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs.Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred.We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable. The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a 30Table of Contentsdeliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables.Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed.Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters.Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. In addition, Reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.Income TaxesDetermining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. During fiscal 2015, the Company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested and recorded a tax liability of $247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax 31Table of Contentsaudit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.Revenues by Segment/Operating GroupOur five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.32Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncrease(Decrease)U.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2015 2014 2015 2014 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$6,349 $5,924 7 % 16% 20% 20%Financial Services6,635 6,511 2 11 21 22Health & Public Service5,463 5,022 9 12 18 17Products7,596 7,395 3 10 25 24Resources4,989 5,135 (3) 5 16 17Other17 15 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES31,048 30,002 3 % 11% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,866 1,872 — TOTAL REVENUES$32,914 $31,875 3 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS (1) North America$14,209 $12,797 11 % 12% 46% 43%Europe10,930 11,255 (3) 10 35 37Growth Markets5,909 5,951 (1) 11 19 20TOTAL NET REVENUES$31,048 $30,002 3 % 11% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$16,204 $15,738 3 % 11% 52% 52%Outsourcing14,844 14,265 4 11 48 48TOTAL NET REVENUES$31,048 $30,002 3 % 11% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)Effective September 1, 2014, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada); Europe; and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey). Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Our business in the United States represented 43%, 40% and 39% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods.Net RevenuesThe following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014:Operating Groups•Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 16% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Communications in all geographic regions as well as Media & Entertainment in North America. Consulting revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Communications in North America and Growth Markets.•Financial Services net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected significant growth, driven by growth across both industry groups and all geographic regions, led by Banking & Capital Markets in Europe. Outsourcing revenue growth was driven by Banking & Capital Markets and Insurance in Europe and Banking & Capital Markets in Growth Markets. These outsourcing increases were partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in North America.33Table of Contents•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 12% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth, led by Health and Public Service in North America. Consulting revenue growth was driven by Health and Public Service in North America.•Products net revenues increased 10% in local currency. Consulting revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Industrial in Europe. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by all geographic regions and in most industry groups, led by Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. These outsourcing increases were partially offset by a decline in Industrial in Europe.•Resources net revenues increased 5% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by Utilities across all geographic regions, Chemicals & Natural Resources in Growth Markets and Energy in Europe. Consulting revenues reflected slight growth, driven by Utilities across all geographic regions and Chemicals & Natural Resources in Europe. These consulting increases were largely offset by declines in Energy in Europe and North America and Chemicals & Natural Resources in Growth Markets.Geographic Regions•North America net revenues increased 12% in local currency, driven by the United States.•Europe net revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and France.•Growth Markets net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by Japan, Brazil and Australia, partially offset by declines in South Korea and Singapore.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $904 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2014, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 86.5%, compared with fiscal 2014. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $910 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2014, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 85.7%, compared with fiscal 2014.Cost of ServicesCost of services for fiscal 2015 increased $915 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2014, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.2% from 69.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $921 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2014, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.4% from 67.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2015 decreased to 31.6% from 32.3% during this period, principally due to higher labor costs, increased usage of subcontractors and higher non-payroll costs including recruiting and training costs from the addition of a larger number of employees compared to fiscal 2014.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015 decreased $78 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2014, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.3% from 11.9% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities. General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2015 decreased $15 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2014, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.8% from 6.1% during this period. Pension Settlement ChargeWe recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of $64 million, pre-tax, during fiscal 2015 as a result of lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments. For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”34Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2015 increased $135 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2014. The pension settlement charge of $64 million recorded in fiscal 2015 decreased operating margin by 20 basis points. Excluding the effects of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2015 increased 20 basis points compared with fiscal 2014.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2015 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2015, each operating group recorded a portion of the $64 million pension settlement charge. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2015, exclusive of the pension settlement charge, compared with fiscal 2014: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth, lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues and higher contract profitability.•Health & Public Service operating income increased due to outsourcing revenue growth.•Products operating income increased due to higher contract profitability and consulting revenue growth.•Resources operating income decreased due to lower contract profitability.35Table of ContentsOther Expense, netOther expense, net for fiscal 2015 increased $29 million over fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses, including losses incurred on the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 25.8%, compared with 26.1% for fiscal 2014. Absent the tax impact of the $64 million pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0%. The fiscal 2015 tax rate includes higher benefits related to final determinations of tax liabilities for prior years, including a $170 million benefit related to final settlement of U.S. tax audits for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and benefits related to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, offset by an increase in withholding taxes payable on the distribution of U.S. earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2015 decreased $14 million, or 6%, from fiscal 2014. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest, partially offset by higher Net income of $98 million for fiscal 2015. Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $4.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with $4.52 for fiscal 2014. The $0.24 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $64 million pension settlement charge, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.06. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 increased $0.30 compared with fiscal 2014, due to increases of $0.22 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.02 from lower non-operating income. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”36Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncrease(Decrease)U.S. Dollars PercentIncrease(Decrease)LocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2014 2013 2014 2013 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$5,924 $5,686 4 % 5% 20% 20%Financial Services6,511 6,166 6 5 22 21Health & Public Service5,022 4,739 6 7 17 17Products7,395 6,807 9 8 24 24Resources5,135 5,143 — 1 17 18Other15 22 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES30,002 28,563 5 % 5% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,872 1,831 2 TOTAL REVENUES$31,875 $30,394 5 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Americas$14,201 $13,519 5 % 6% 47% 47%EMEA (1)11,915 11,047 8 4 40 39Asia Pacific3,886 3,997 (3) 4 13 14TOTAL NET REVENUES$30,002 $28,563 5 % 5% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$15,738 $15,383 2 % 3% 52% 54%Outsourcing14,265 13,179 8 8 48 46TOTAL NET REVENUES$30,002 $28,563 5 % 5% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Our business in the United States represented 40%, 39% and 36% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods.Net RevenuesThe following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, based on the organization of our geographic regions and industry groups in place during these fiscal years:Operating Groups•Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 5% in local currency. Outsourcing revenue growth was driven by all industry groups in Americas and Electronics & High Tech in Asia Pacific. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Electronics & High Tech in EMEA. Consulting revenues reflected modest growth, led by Electronics & High Tech in Americas and EMEA, partially offset by declines in Communications across all geographic regions.•Financial Services net revenues increased 5% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by all industry groups in EMEA and Asia Pacific and Capital Markets in Americas. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Insurance in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in Insurance in EMEA and Americas, partially offset by growth in Banking in EMEA and Asia Pacific. While fiscal 2014 consulting net revenues reflected a slight decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2014 partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2014.•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, led by Health and Public Service in Americas, partially offset by a decline in Health in EMEA. Consulting revenues 37Table of Contentsreflected modest growth, driven by Public Service and Health in Americas and Public Service in Asia Pacific, partially offset by a decline in Public Service in EMEA.•Products net revenues increased 8% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions in most industry groups, led by Air, Freight & Travel Services and Life Sciences in Americas and Retail in EMEA. These increases were partially offset by declines in Retail in Americas, and Consumer Goods & Services and Air, Freight & Travel Services in EMEA. Consulting revenues reflected strong growth, driven by most industry groups in EMEA, led by Retail, Consumer Goods & Services and Auto, and in Americas, led by Consumer Goods & Services and Air, Freight & Travel Services. This growth was partially offset by declines in Retail in Asia Pacific and Americas.•Resources net revenues increased 1% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected modest growth, driven by Energy in Americas and Utilities in EMEA, partially offset by a decline in Utilities in Americas. Consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in Natural Resources across all geographic regions and Energy in Americas, partially offset by growth in Energy in Asia Pacific and EMEA, Utilities in EMEA and Chemicals in Americas. Some of our clients, primarily in Natural Resources, continued to reduce their level of consulting investments. In addition, several large systems integration projects have ended or have transitioned to smaller phases and demand for our services has moderated. Geographic Regions•Americas net revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by the United States, partially offset by a decline in Canada.•EMEA net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany and Norway. These increases were partially offset by declines in Spain, South Africa and Finland.•Asia Pacific net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by Japan and to a lesser extent India, partially offset by declines in Singapore and South Korea.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for fiscal 2014 increased $1,519 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 86.5% from 85.7% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2014 increased $1,478 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 85.7% from 84.8% during this period. Operating expenses for fiscal 2013 included reorganization benefits of $274 million as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001.Cost of ServicesCost of services for fiscal 2014 increased $1,180 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.6% from 69.1% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2014 increased $1,139 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.7% from 67.1% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2014 decreased to 32.3% from 32.9% during this period. There were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during fiscal 2014. We experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases and/or rebalance the mix of resources. In addition, we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts. While we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014, the amounts accrued were lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014 increased $101 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.9% from 12.2% during this period. 38Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2014 decreased $17 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.1% from 6.4% during this period. Reorganization (Benefits) Costs, netWe recorded net reorganization benefits of $272 million ($274 million in reorganization benefits less $1.9 million in interest expense accrued) during fiscal 2013 as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. Operating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2014 decreased $38 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 14.3% from 15.2% during this period. During fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased operating margin by 100 basis points. Excluding the effects of the fiscal 2013 reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2014 increased 10 basis points compared to fiscal 2013. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2014 2013 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin (in millions of U.S. dollars)Communications, Media & Technology$770 13% $786 14%Financial Services957 15 1,003 16Health & Public Service679 14 594 13Products992 13 985 14Resources902 18 971 19Total$4,301 14.3% $4,339 15.2% _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Fiscal 2013 Reorganization Benefits (Non-GAAP) Fiscal 2014 2013 Operating Income and Operating Margin as Reported (GAAP) Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Reorganization Benefits (Non-GAAP) OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome(GAAP) Reorganization Benefits (1) Operating Income (2) OperatingMargin (2) Increase(Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars)Communications, Media & Technology$770 13% $786 $53 $733 13% $37Financial Services957 15 1,003 59 944 15 13Health & Public Service679 14 594 48 546 12 132Products992 13 985 65 921 14 71Resources902 18 971 49 921 18 (19)Total$4,301 14.3% $4,339 $274 $4,065 14.2% $236_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)Represents reorganization benefits related to final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure during 2001. (2)We have presented Operating income and operating margin excluding reorganization benefits, as we believe the effect of the reorganization benefits on Operating income and operating margin facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these benefits and our operating performance.39Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2014, the financial results of each operating group benefited from a reduction in variable compensation compared to fiscal 2013. The commentary below provides additional insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, exclusive of the reorganization benefit recorded in fiscal 2013: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income was impacted by lower contract profitability, including early-stage work at lower margins on a few large contracts. Operating income was favorably impacted by revenue growth.•Financial Services operating income was impacted by lower contract profitability, including early-stage work at lower margins on a few large outsourcing contracts. Operating income was favorably impacted by outsourcing revenue growth.•Health & Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth.•Products operating income was impacted by lower consulting contract profitability, including delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts. Operating income was favorably impacted by revenue growth.•Resources operating income was impacted by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. Operating income was favorably impacted by higher outsourcing contract profitability.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 26.1%, compared with 18.1% for fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense. In addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. Absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3%. The higher effective tax rate during fiscal 2014 is primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” The resulting Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2014 decreased $38 million, or 14%, from fiscal 2013. The decrease was due to lower Net income of $379 million and a reduction in the Accenture Holdings ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 6% for fiscal 2014 from 7% for fiscal 2013.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $4.52 for fiscal 2014, compared with $4.93 for fiscal 2013. The $0.41 decrease in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by $0.38, and the $243 million tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits, which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by $0.34. Excluding the impact of these benefits, earnings per share for fiscal 2014 increased $0.31 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2013, due to increases of $0.25 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.12 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.06 from a higher effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of U.S. federal tax audits and reorganization benefits. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”40Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:•facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;•acquire complementary businesses or technologies;•take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or•develop new services and solutions.As of August 31, 2015, Cash and cash equivalents were $4.4 billion, compared with $4.9 billion as of August 31, 2014.Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2015 2014 2013 2015 to 2014 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,092 $3,486 $3,303 $606Investing activities(1,170) (1,056) (1,156) (114)Financing activities(3,202) (3,165) (3,066) (37)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(280) 25 (90) (305)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(561) $(711) $(1,009) $150_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Operating activities: The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including lower spending on certain compensation payments and higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues).Investing activities: The $114 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increased spending on property and equipment and business acquisitions.Financing activities: The $37 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by decreased purchases of shares. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.41Table of ContentsBorrowing FacilitiesAs of August 31, 2015, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: FacilityAmount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions of U.S. dollars)Syndicated loan facility (1)$1,000 $—Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities (2)516 —Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit (3)145 —Total$1,661 $—_______________ (1)This facility, which matures on October 31, 2016, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Financing is provided under this facility at the prime rate or at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of August 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no borrowings under the facility.(2)We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local-currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of August 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no borrowings under these facilities.(3)We also maintain local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit for those locations that cannot access our global facilities. As of August 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no borrowings under these various facilities.Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $167 million and $170 million of letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we had total outstanding debt of $27 million as of both August 31, 2015 and 2014.Share Purchases and RedemptionsThe Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares (or, prior to August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA Class I common shares) and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.Our share purchase activity during fiscal 2015 was as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary and Accenture CanadaHoldings Inc.

These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees.(2)During fiscal 2015, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2016. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels 42Table of Contentsof cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.Other Share RedemptionsDuring fiscal 2015, we issued 6,240,119 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares (or, prior to August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA Class I common shares) pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.Subsequent DevelopmentsOn September 21, 2015, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.10 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 16, 2015. On September 23, 2015, the Board of Directors of Accenture Holdings plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.10 per share on its ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 13, 2015. Both dividends are payable on November 13, 2015.On September 21, 2015, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc approved $5,000 million in additional share repurchase authority, bringing Accenture’s total outstanding authority to approximately $7,581 million.Obligations and CommitmentsAs of August 31, 2015, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt $27 $2 $6 $7 $13Operating leases 2,455 470 742 512 732Retirement obligations (2) 107 11 22 22 52Purchase obligations and other commitments (3) 168 106 62 1 —Total $2,758 $588 $831 $542 $796 _______________Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, refer to Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”(2)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001.(3)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”43Table of ContentsNew Accounting PronouncementOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties.Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real and U.S. dollar/U.K. pound—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2015, it was anticipated that approximately $20 million of net losses, net of tax currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $305 million and $259 million as of August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Interest Rate RiskThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2015 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.Equity Price RiskThe equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 17:35:34.196696
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2016,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2016” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2016. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Net revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to fiscal 2015. Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, revenue growth in local currency was significant in Products and strong in Health & Public Service and Financial Services. Communications, Media & Technology revenue growth in local currency was solid, while Resources was flat. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and solid in outsourcing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. While the business environment remained competitive, we experienced pricing improvement in several areas of our business in fiscal 2016. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Net consulting revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency compared to fiscal 2015. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was led by very significant growth in Products, as well as strong growth in Financial Services, Health & Public Service and Communications, Media & Technology, while Resources had a slight decline. We continue to experience growing demand for digital-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. Compared to fiscal 2015, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower cost resources in our Global Delivery Network. This trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue in our systems integration business, and we expect this trend to continue.In our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency compared to fiscal 2015. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was driven by very strong growth in Health & Public Service as well as solid growth in Products and Financial Services. We are experiencing growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digital-related services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming 28Table of Contentstheir operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. Compared to fiscal 2015, we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. When compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015, the U.S. dollar strengthened against many currencies during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% and 5% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for fiscal 2017, we estimate that our full fiscal 2017 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately equal to our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 92%, up from 91% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 90% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 384,000 as of August 31, 2016, compared to approximately 358,000 as of August 31, 2015. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 16%, up from 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2016 became effective December 1, 2015. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 31.3%, compared with 31.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Gross margin for fiscal 2016 was 31.3%, compared with 31.6% for fiscal 2015. The reduction in gross margin for fiscal 2016 was principally due to higher labor costs and higher costs associated with acquisition activities compared to fiscal 2015. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with 17.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.6% for fiscal 2016, compared with 17.1% for fiscal 2015. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis points principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points.Operating expenses in fiscal 2015 included a Pension settlement charge of $64 million related to lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 14.1%, compared with 13.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 14.6%, compared with 14.3% for fiscal 2015. The Pension settlement charge of $64 million recorded in fiscal 2015 decreased operating 29Table of Contentsmargin by 20 basis points for fiscal 2015. Excluding the effect of the Pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2015 would have been 14.5%. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a $548 million gain on sale of business and $56 million in taxes related to the divestiture of our Navitaire business, as well as a $301 million gain on sale of business and $48 million in taxes related to the partial divestiture of our Duck Creek business. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 22.4%, compared with 25.8% for fiscal 2015. Absent the $849 million Gain on sale of businesses and related $104 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2%. Absent the $64 million Pension settlement charge and related $25 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0%.Diluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016, compared with $4.76 for fiscal 2015. The Gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, recorded during fiscal 2016 increased Diluted earnings per share by $1.11 in fiscal 2016. The Pension settlement charge, net of taxes, recorded during fiscal 2015 decreased Diluted earnings per share by $0.06 in fiscal 2015. Excluding these impacts, Diluted earnings per share would have been $5.34 and $4.82 for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have presented Operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and Diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the fiscal 2016 Gain on sale of businesses and the fiscal 2015 Pension settlement charge, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period. Our Operating income and Diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our Global Delivery Network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Bookings and Backlog New bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 were $8.99 billion, with consulting bookings of $4.81 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.18 billion. New bookings for fiscal 2016 were $35.39 billion, with consulting bookings of $19.16 billion and outsourcing bookings of $16.23 billion.We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. 30Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs. Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or 31Table of Contentsincremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred. We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable. The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables. Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. 32Table of ContentsNo taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. During fiscal 2015, the Company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded a tax liability of $247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions. Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. 33Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncrease(Decrease)U.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2016 2015 2016 2015 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$6,616 $6,349 4 % 9% 20% 20%Financial Services7,031 6,635 6 11 21 21Health & Public Service5,987 5,463 10 12 18 18Products8,395 7,596 11 15 26 25Resources4,839 4,989 (3) 3 15 16Other15 17 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES32,883 31,048 6 % 10% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,915 1,866 3 TOTAL REVENUES$34,798 $32,914 6 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS North America$15,653 $14,209 10 % 11% 48% 46%Europe11,448 10,930 5 11 35 35Growth Markets5,781 5,909 (2) 8 17 19TOTAL NET REVENUES$32,883 $31,048 6 % 10% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$17,868 $16,204 10 % 15% 54% 52%Outsourcing15,015 14,844 1 6 46 48TOTAL NET REVENUES$32,883 $31,048 6 % 10% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Our business in the United States represented 46%, 43% and 40% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods. Net Revenues The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015:Operating Groups •Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 9% in local currency. Net revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all industry groups in North America and Growth Markets, as well as Media & Entertainment in Europe.•Financial Services net revenues increased 11% in local currency. Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in both industry groups across all geographic regions, led by Banking & Capital Markets in Europe.•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 12% in local currency. Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth in both industry groups across all geographic regions, led by Public Service and Health in North America.•Products net revenues increased 15% in local currency. Net revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, as well as Industrial in Europe and Life Sciences in North America.34Table of Contents•Resources net revenues increased 3% in local currency. Net revenues reflected modest growth, as significant growth in Utilities across all geographic regions was largely offset by declines in Chemicals & Natural Resources in Growth Markets and North America and Energy in Europe and Growth Markets. We have experienced lower or negative revenue growth in Chemicals & Natural Resources and Energy, principally due to economic challenges in these industries, and we expect this trend to continue in the near term.Geographic Regions •North America net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by the United States.•Europe net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany and France.•Growth Markets net revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by Japan, as well as China, India, South Africa and Mexico.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2016 increased $1,509 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2015, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 86.2% from 86.5% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2016 increased $1,460 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2015, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 85.4% from 85.7% during this period.Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2016 increased $1,415 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2015, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.5% from 70.2% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2016 increased $1,367 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2015, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.7% from 68.4% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2016 decreased to 31.3% from 31.6% in fiscal 2015. The reduction in gross margin for fiscal 2016 was principally due to higher labor costs and higher costs associated with acquisition activities compared to fiscal 2015. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2016 increased $75 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2015, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.9% from 11.3% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2016 increased $83 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2015, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.7% from 5.8% during this period. Pension Settlement Charge We recorded a Pension settlement charge of $64 million during fiscal 2015 as a result of lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 35Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2016 increased $375 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded a Pension settlement charge of $64 million, which decreased operating margin by 20 basis points. Excluding the effect of the fiscal 2015 Pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2016 increased 10 basis points compared with fiscal 2015. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2016 2015 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin (in millions of U.S. dollars)Communications, Media & Technology$966 15% $871 14%Financial Services1,128 16 1,079 16Health & Public Service807 13 701 13Products1,282 15 1,082 14Resources628 13 702 14Total$4,810 14.6% $4,436 14.3% _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.

(1)Represents Pension settlement charge related to lump sum cash payment from plan assets offered to eligible former employees. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2016 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2016, each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, exclusive of the Pension settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2015: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and consulting revenue growth.•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth.•Health & Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.36Table of Contents•Products operating income increased due to very significant consulting revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.•Resources operating income decreased due to lower outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.Other Expense, net Other expense, net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. During fiscal 2016, Other expense, net increased $25 million over fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses, including losses incurred on the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira. Gain on Sale of Businesses We recorded a gain from the Navitaire divestiture of $548 million and a gain from the Duck Creek partial divestiture of $301 million during fiscal 2016. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 22.4%, compared with 25.8% for fiscal 2015. Absent the $849 million Gain on sale of businesses and related $104 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2016, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2%. Absent the $64 million Pension settlement charge and related $25 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 benefited from a final determination of U.S. Federal taxes for fiscal 2012. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 benefited from a final determination of U.S. Federal taxes for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. This was offset by expenses associated with an increase in deferred tax liabilities during fiscal 2015, when we concluded that certain undistributed earnings of our U.S. subsidiaries would no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2016 increased $18 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2015. The increase was due to higher Net income of $1,076 million, primarily driven by the Gain on sale of businesses, partially offset by a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest during fiscal 2016. Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016, compared with $4.76 for fiscal 2015. The $1.69 increase in our Diluted earnings per share included the impact of the Gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11 and the impact of the Pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.06. Excluding these impacts, Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 increased $0.52 compared with fiscal 2015, due to increases of $0.34 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.13 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 from higher non-operating expense. For information regarding our Earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”37Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncrease(Decrease)U.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2015 2014 2015 2014 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$6,349 $5,924 7 % 16% 20% 20%Financial Services6,635 6,511 2 11 21 22Health & Public Service5,463 5,022 9 12 18 17Products7,596 7,395 3 10 25 24Resources4,989 5,135 (3) 5 16 17Other17 15 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES31,048 30,002 3 % 11% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,866 1,872 — TOTAL REVENUES$32,914 $31,875 3 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS (1) North America$14,209 $12,797 11 % 12% 46% 43%Europe10,930 11,255 (3) 10 35 37Growth Markets5,909 5,951 (1) 11 19 20TOTAL NET REVENUES$31,048 $30,002 3 % 11% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$16,204 $15,738 3 % 11% 52% 52%Outsourcing14,844 14,265 4 11 48 48TOTAL NET REVENUES$31,048 $30,002 3 % 11% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)Effective September 1, 2014, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada); Europe; and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey).

Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $910 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2014, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 85.7%, compared with fiscal 2014.Cost of ServicesCost of services for fiscal 2015 increased $915 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2014, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.2% from 69.6% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2015 increased $921 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2014, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.4% from 67.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2015 decreased to 31.6% from 32.3% in fiscal 2014, principally due to higher labor costs, increased usage of subcontractors and higher non-payroll costs including recruiting and training costs from the addition of a larger number of employees compared to fiscal 2014.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015 decreased $78 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2014, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.3% from 11.9% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities. General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2015 decreased $15 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2014, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.8% from 6.1% during this period.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income during fiscal 2015 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2015, each operating group recorded a portion of the $64 million Pension settlement charge. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2015, exclusive of the Pension settlement charge, compared with fiscal 2014: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth, lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues and higher contract profitability.•Health & Public Service operating income increased due to outsourcing revenue growth.•Products operating income increased due to higher contract profitability and consulting revenue growth.40Table of Contents•Resources operating income decreased due to lower contract profitability.Other Expense, netOther expense, net for fiscal 2015 increased $29 million over fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses, including losses incurred on the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 25.8%, compared with 26.1% for fiscal 2014. Absent the tax impact of the $64 million Pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0%. The fiscal 2015 tax rate includes higher benefits related to final determinations of tax liabilities for prior years, including a $170 million benefit related to final settlement of U.S. tax audits for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and benefits related to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, offset by an increase in withholding taxes payable on the distribution of U.S. earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2015 decreased $14 million, or 6%, from fiscal 2014. The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest, partially offset by higher Net income of $98 million for fiscal 2015. Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $4.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with $4.52 for fiscal 2014. The $0.24 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $64 million Pension settlement charge, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.06. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 increased $0.30 compared with fiscal 2014, due to increases of $0.22 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.02 from lower non-operating income. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”41Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends; •acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. As of August 31, 2016, Cash and cash equivalents were $4.9 billion, compared with $4.4 billion as of August 31, 2015.Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2016 2015 2014 2016 to 2015 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,575 $4,092 $3,486 $483Investing activities(610) (1,170) (1,056) 560Financing activities(3,397) (3,202) (3,165) (195)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(23) (280) 25 257Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$545 $(561) $(711) $1,105_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by revenue growth and higher operating income, as well as higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, current and non-current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by other changes in operating assets and liabilities, including higher spending on certain compensation payments. Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities decreased $560 million year-over-year, as higher spending on business acquisitions, investments and property and equipment was more than offset by proceeds of $815 million from the Navitaire divestiture and Duck Creek partial divestiture. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Financing activities: The $195 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares and an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We believe that our available cash balances and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 42Table of ContentsBorrowing Facilities As of August 31, 2016, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: FacilityAmount BorrowingsUnderFacilities (in millions of U.S. dollars)Syndicated loan facility (1)$1,000 $—Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities (2)516 —Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit (3)165 —Total$1,681 $—_______________ (1)On December 22, 2015, we replaced our $1.0 billion syndicated loan facility maturing on October 31, 2016 with a $1.0 billion syndicated loan facility maturing on December 22, 2020.

(2)During fiscal 2016, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. 43Table of ContentsWe intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2017. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Other Share Redemptions During fiscal 2016, we issued 775,023 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Subsequent Developments On September 27, 2016, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share on our Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 21, 2016. On September 28, 2016, the Board of Directors of Accenture Holdings plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share on its ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 18, 2016. Both dividends are payable on November 15, 2016.Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2016, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt $27 $3 $7 $8 $9Operating leases 2,817 517 821 577 903Retirement obligations (2) 106 11 22 22 51Purchase obligations and other commitments (3) 145 56 89 — —Total $3,096 $586 $940 $607 $962 _______________Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (2)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (3)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. 44Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In August 2016, we early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet. We adopted this ASU using the retrospective method which required reclassification of current deferred taxes as previously reported on our August 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets to non-current, resulting in an increase to non-current deferred tax assets of $816 million and a decrease to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $22 million.New Accounting Pronouncements On March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In addition, the ASU includes provisions that impact the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification of excess tax benefits on the cash flow statements. We will early adopt the standard effective September 1, 2016. Following adoption, the primary impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital, which will likely result in increased volatility in the reported amounts of income tax expense and net income. We estimate this change will reduce our fiscal 2017 effective tax rate by less than two percentage points. The actual impact of adopting this standard on the effective tax rate will vary depending on our share price during fiscal 2017. Provisions of the new guidance related to changes to classification of excess tax benefits in the cash flow statements are expected to be adopted retrospectively. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of the adoption of this guidance and our preliminary assessments are subject to change.On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment. The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2017, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2019, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2020, and allows for a modified retrospective method upon adoption. We are assessing the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Accounting Standard Codification 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU will be effective for us beginning September 1, 2018, including interim periods in our fiscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective methods of adoption. We will adopt the guidance on September 1, 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method.We are assessing the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.45Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Brazilian real, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Norwegian krone—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our Global Delivery Network. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to resources supplied by our Global Delivery Network. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2016, it was anticipated that approximately $61 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $328 million and $305 million as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Interest Rate RiskThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2016 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Other Market Risk The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of August 31, 2016.Equity Price RiskThe equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 17:35:34.411067
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2017” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2017. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for fiscal 2017 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency compared to fiscal 2016. Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across most areas of our business. During fiscal 2017, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Products and strong in Financial Services, while there was solid growth in Communications, Media & Technology and modest growth in Health & Public Service and Resources. We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets and strong growth in Europe, while growth in North America moderated. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in both outsourcing and consulting during fiscal 2017. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.In our consulting business, net revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency compared to fiscal 2016. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2017 was led by very strong growth in Products, as well as strong growth in Financial Services and modest growth in Communications, Media & Technology, while Health & Public Service and Resources had slight declines. Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.In our outsourcing business, net revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to fiscal 2016. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2017 was led by very strong growth in Products, as well as strong growth in Health & Public Service, Communications, Media & Technology and Financial Services and solid growth in Resources. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digital-related services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. Compared to fiscal 2016, the U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2017, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue 28Table of Contentsgrowth that was approximately 1% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. However, when compared to the three months ended August 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies resulting in minimal currency translation impact during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for fiscal 2017 was 91%, flat with fiscal 2016. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 425,000 as of August 31, 2017, compared to approximately 384,000 as of August 31, 2016. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2017 was 14%, flat with fiscal 2016. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for fiscal 2017 was 31.7%, compared with 31.3% for fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017 was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.9% for fiscal 2017, compared with 16.6% for fiscal 2016. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues increased 40 basis points, principally due to higher technology and facilities costs, as well as higher acquisition-related costs.During fiscal 2017, we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for fiscal 2017 was 13.3%, compared with 14.6% for fiscal 2016. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150 basis points for fiscal 2017. Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2017 would have been 14.8%. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a $548 million gain on sale of business and $56 million in taxes related to the divestiture of our Navitaire business, as well as a $301 million gain on sale of business and $48 million in taxes related to the partial divestiture of our Duck Creek business. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 21.3%, compared with 22.4% for fiscal 2016. Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes described above, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0%. Absent the gain on sale of our Navitaire and Duck Creek businesses and related taxes described above, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2%. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”29Table of ContentsDiluted earnings per share were $5.44 for fiscal 2017, compared with $6.45 for fiscal 2016. The pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in fiscal 2017. The gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $1.11 in fiscal 2016. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $5.91 and $5.34 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the fiscal 2017 pension settlement charge and the fiscal 2016 gain on sale of businesses, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our operating performance in comparison to the prior period. Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Bookings and Backlog New bookings for fiscal 2017 were $37.4 billion, with consulting bookings of $19.8 billion and outsourcing bookings of $17.6 billion.We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. 30Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs. Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or 31Table of Contentsincremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred. We enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable. The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price charged when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis by the Company to similarly situated customers. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables. Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. 32Table of ContentsNo taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. During fiscal 2015, the Company distributed substantially all of the earnings of its U.S. subsidiaries that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested and recorded a tax liability of $247 million for withholding taxes payable on this distribution. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. Operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. 33Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncreaseU.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$6,885 $6,616 4% 4% 20% 20%Financial Services7,394 7,031 5 7 21 21Health & Public Service6,178 5,987 3 3 18 18Products9,500 8,395 13 14 27 26Resources4,847 4,839 — 1 14 15Other46 15 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES34,850 32,883 6% 7% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,915 1,915 — TOTAL REVENUES$36,765 $34,798 6% GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS North America$16,291 $15,653 4% 4% 47% 48%Europe11,933 11,448 4 8 34 35Growth Markets6,626 5,781 15 12 19 17TOTAL NET REVENUES$34,850 $32,883 6% 7% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$18,754 $17,868 5% 6% 54% 54%Outsourcing16,096 15,015 7 8 46 46TOTAL NET REVENUES$34,850 $32,883 6% 7% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding. Our business in the United States represented 45%, 46% and 43% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods. Net Revenues We have changed the structure of our Communications, Media & Technology operating group to reflect the continued convergence of the communications, media and entertainment industries, as well as the opportunity we are seeing in the software and platform sectors. The new structure includes the following industry groups: Communications & Media (Telecommunications, Cable, Broadcasting and Content & Publishing); Software & Platforms (Internet & Social and Software); and High Tech (Network Equipment Providers, Aerospace & Defense, Consumer Technology, Semiconductor, Medical Equipment and Enterprise Markets). The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016:Operating Groups •Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 4% in local currency, led by Software & Platforms in North America, as well as growth across all industry groups in Growth Markets. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Communications & Media in Europe, as disruptions in the market continue to impact demand.•Financial Services net revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by Banking & Capital Markets in Europe and Growth Markets.•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by Public Service in Growth Markets and Europe.34Table of Contents•Products net revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by very strong growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, as well as Life Sciences in North America and Industrial in Europe.•Resources net revenues increased 1% in local currency, led by Utilities in Europe, partially offset by declines in Energy across all geographic regions.Geographic Regions •North America net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by the United States.•Europe net revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as France, Spain and Switzerland.•Growth Markets net revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by Japan, as well as Australia, Singapore and China.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $2,146 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.4% from 86.2% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $2,145 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.7% from 85.4% during this period.Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2017 increased $1,215 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.0% from 70.5% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $1,214 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.3% from 68.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2017 increased to 31.7% from 31.3% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017 was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues, compared to fiscal 2016. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 increased $174 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.8% from 10.9% during this period.General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2017 increased $247 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.1% from 5.7% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to higher technology and facilities costs, as well as higher acquisition-related costs. Pension Settlement Charge We recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 35Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2017 decreased $178 million, or 4%, from fiscal 2016. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150 basis points. Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for fiscal 2017 increased 20 basis points compared with fiscal 2016. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2017 2016 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin Increase(Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology$1,049 15% $966 15% $83Financial Services1,207 16 1,128 16 80Health & Public Service773 13 807 13 (34)Products1,559 16 1,282 15 276Resources555 11 628 13 (73)Pension Settlement Charge (1)(510) — — — (510)Operating Income (GAAP)$4,633 13.3% $4,810 14.6% $(178)Pension Settlement Charge (1)510 — 510Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP)$5,142 14.8% $4,810 14.6% $332 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)Represents pension settlement charge related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2017 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2017, each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.•Health & Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower outsourcing contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenues.•Products operating income increased principally due to very strong revenue growth, as well as higher consulting contract profitability.•Resources operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenue.Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. During fiscal 2017, other expense decreased $31 million from fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses.Gain (Loss) on Sale of Businesses We recorded a gain from the Navitaire divestiture of $548 million and a gain from the Duck Creek partial divestiture of $301 million during fiscal 2016. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 36Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 21.3%, compared with 22.4% for fiscal 2016. Absent the pension settlement charge of $510 million and related tax impact of $198 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0%. Absent the gain on sale of businesses of $849 million and related tax impact of $104 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes, other adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, and the recognition of excess tax benefits from share based payments as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. This was partially offset by a net increase to prior-year non-U.S. tax liabilities, primarily related to a final assessment of prior-year taxes in Switzerland. The fiscal 2016 effective tax rate also benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017 decreased $48 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2016. The decrease was due to lower net income of $715 million, primarily driven by the pension settlement charge recorded during fiscal 2017 as well as the gain on sale of businesses recorded during fiscal 2016.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $5.44 for fiscal 2017, compared with $6.45 for fiscal 2016. The $1.01 decrease in our diluted earnings per share included both the impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by $0.47 and the impact of the gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $5.91 and $5.34 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.57 due to increases of $0.38 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.06 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.04 from lower non-operating expense.

Gross margin for fiscal 2016 decreased to 31.3% from 31.6% in fiscal 2015. The reduction in gross margin for fiscal 2016 was principally due to higher labor costs and higher costs associated with acquisition activities compared to fiscal 2015.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2016 increased $75 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2015, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.9% from 11.3% in fiscal 2015. The decrease as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities.General and Administrative CostsGeneral and administrative costs for fiscal 2016 increased $83 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2015, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.7% from 5.8% in fiscal 2015.Pension Settlement ChargeWe recorded a pension settlement charge of $64 million during fiscal 2015 as a result of lump sum cash payments made from our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 39Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating MarginOperating income for fiscal 2016 increased $375 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2015.

Absent the $64 million pension settlement charge and related $25 million in taxes recorded during fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 benefited from a final determination of U.S. federal taxes for fiscal 2012. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 benefited from a final determination of U.S. federal taxes for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. This was offset by expenses associated with an increase in deferred tax liabilities during fiscal 2015, when we concluded that certain undistributed earnings of our U.S. subsidiaries would no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2016 increased $18 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2015. The increase was due to higher net income of $1,076 million, primarily driven by the gain on sale of businesses, partially offset by a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest during fiscal 2016.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016, compared with $4.76 for fiscal 2015.The $1.69 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11 and the impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.06. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 increased $0.52 compared with fiscal 2015, due to increases of $0.34 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.13 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 from higher non-operating expense. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.""41Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility. In addition, we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends; •acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. As of August 31, 2017, Cash and cash equivalents were $4.1 billion, compared with $4.9 billion as of August 31, 2016.Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2017 2016 2015 2017 to 2016 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,973 $4,667 $4,176 $306Investing activities(2,234) (610) (1,170) (1,624)Financing activities(3,560) (3,489) (3,286) (71)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents42 (23) (280) 65Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(779) $545 $(561) $(1,324)_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income in fiscal 2017 after excluding the non-cash impact of the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017 and the gain on sale of businesses in fiscal 2016 (proceeds from divestitures are reflected in investing activities).Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities increased $1,624 million year-over-year, due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments in fiscal 2017. Additionally, in fiscal 2016, spending on business acquisitions and investments was largely offset by proceeds from the Navitaire divestiture and Duck Creek partial divestiture. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Financing activities: The $71 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.Borrowing Facilities See Note 8 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 42Table of ContentsShare Purchases and Redemptions We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2018. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Subsequent Developments See Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2017, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt $25 $3 $8 $10 $4Operating leases 3,707 562 958 758 1,429Retirement obligations (2) 103 11 22 21 49Purchase obligations and other commitments (3) 157 67 87 3 —Total $3,992 $643 $1,075 $792 $1,482 _______________(1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (2)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (3)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Recently Adopted and New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 43Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Swedish krona—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2017, it was anticipated that approximately $112 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $494 million and $328 million as of August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Interest Rate RiskThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2017 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Other Market Risk The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of August 31, 2017.Equity Price RiskThe equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 17:35:31.789642
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2018,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2018. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for fiscal 2018 increased 13.5% in U.S. dollars and 10.5% in local currency compared to fiscal 2017. Demand for our services and solutions continued to be very strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During fiscal 2018, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Communication, Media & Technology, Resources and Products and strong in Financial Services and Health & Public Service. We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets and strong growth in North America and Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in consulting and strong in outsourcing during fiscal 2018. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.In our consulting business, net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency compared to fiscal 2017. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2018 was led by very strong growth in Communications, Media & Technology, Resources, Financial Services and Products as well as strong growth in Health & Public Service. Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.In our outsourcing business, net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to fiscal 2017. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2018 was led by very strong growth in Communications, Media & Technology, Resources and Products, as well as strong growth in Health & Public Service and modest growth in Financial Services. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during fiscal 2018, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was 28Table of Contentsapproximately 3% higher than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 2.5% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for fiscal 2018 was 91%, flat with fiscal 2017. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 459,000 as of August 31, 2018, compared to approximately 425,000 as of August 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2018 was 15%, up from 14% in fiscal 2017. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for fiscal 2018 was 31.4%, compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to fiscal 2017, partially offset by other cost efficiencies in fiscal 2018.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.7% for fiscal 2018, compared with 16.9% for fiscal 2017. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 20 basis points and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat.During fiscal 2017, we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for fiscal 2018 was 14.8%, compared with 13.3% for fiscal 2017. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 150 basis points for fiscal 2017. Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for fiscal 2017 would have been flat with fiscal 2018 at 14.8%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 27.4%, compared with 21.3% for fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) of $178 million. Absent this charge and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 23.0%. Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes described above, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have also been 23.0%. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Diluted earnings per share were $6.34 for fiscal 2018, compared with $5.44 for fiscal 2017. The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.40 in fiscal 2018. The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in fiscal 2017. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.74 and $5.91 for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. We have presented effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in fiscal 2018 and the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017 as well as operating income and operating margin 29Table of Contentsexcluding the impact of the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impacts of these items and our financial performance when comparing these periods. Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” As described further in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), on March 13, 2018 our subsidiary Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. The merger was internal and administrative in nature.Beginning in fiscal 2019, we are adopting new accounting standards that will affect the accounting for revenue and pension costs: Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09: “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606); and ASU No. 2017-07: “Compensation—Retirement Benefits” (Topic 715). In connection with the adoption, we will present total revenues and will no longer report revenues before reimbursements. Also, certain components of pension costs will be reclassified from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. In our subsequent periodic reports, prior-period results will be revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. Additionally, on September 1, 2018, we will adopt ASU No. 2016-16: “Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory”, which will require us to record deferred tax assets of up to $2.1 billion and incremental income tax expense going forward, as these deferred tax assets are utilized. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Bookings and BacklogNew bookings for fiscal 2018 were $42.81 billion, with consulting bookings of $23.63 billion and outsourcing bookings of $19.18 billion. We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. Normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. 30Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition Our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. In addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. We recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. Our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in Cost of services and classified in Other accrued liabilities. Revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. For non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. Contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. Outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. In a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. Revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. In such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. Revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. We continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. Circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs. Costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. The deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. Contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred. 31Table of ContentsWe enter into contracts that may consist of multiple deliverables. These contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. Revenues for contracts with multiple deliverables are allocated based on the lesser of the element’s relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another deliverable. The selling price of each deliverable is determined by obtaining third party evidence of the selling price for the deliverable and is based on the price we charge when largely similar services are sold on a standalone basis to similarly situated customers. If the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a deliverable accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. Revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate deliverables when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate deliverables exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the completed deliverable, performance of the in-process deliverable is considered probable and substantially in our control. While determining fair value and identifying separate deliverables require judgment, generally fair value and the separate deliverables are readily identifiable as we also sell those deliverables unaccompanied by other deliverables. Revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as Unbilled services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as Deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. Client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. Our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. Consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. Net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. Reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. In addition, Reimbursements include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. We report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The Tax Act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. Due to the recent enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we had previously recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements. In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded an adjustment of $40,927 to our provisional tax expense resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act. While we now consider our analysis of these items under the Tax Act to be complete, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance. The election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the election is made. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. 32Table of ContentsWe apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute any remaining undistributed earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. In addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting net revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. 33Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncreaseU.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$8,031 $6,885 17% 14% 20% 20%Financial Services8,238 7,394 11 7 21 21Health & Public Service6,688 6,178 8 7 17 18Products10,854 9,500 14 11 28 27Resources5,657 4,847 17 13 14 14Other105 46 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES39,573 34,850 13.5% 10.5% 100% 100%Reimbursements2,030 1,915 6 TOTAL REVENUES$41,603 $36,765 13% GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS (1) North America$17,849 $16,291 10% 9% 45% 47%Europe14,112 12,002 18 9 36 34Growth Markets7,613 6,557 16 16 19 19TOTAL NET REVENUES$39,573 $34,850 13.5% 10.5% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$21,574 $18,754 15% 12% 55% 54%Outsourcing17,999 16,096 12 9 45 46TOTAL NET REVENUES$39,573 $34,850 13.5% 10.5% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2017, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada), Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Our business in the United States represented 43%, 45% and 46% of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during these periods. Net Revenues The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017: Operating Groups •Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by growth across all geographic regions in Software & Platforms and Communications & Media, led by Software & Platforms in North America.•Financial Services net revenues increased 7% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Banking & Capital Markets in Europe and Growth Markets.•Health & Public Service net revenues increased 7% in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service across all geographic regions and Health in North America.•Products net revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by growth across all geographic regions, in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Industrial.34Table of Contents•Resources net revenues increased 13% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions led by Chemicals & Natural Resources and Energy.Geographic Regions •North America net revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States.•Europe net revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by Germany, Italy, France, Ireland and Spain.•Growth Markets net revenues increased 16% in local currency, led by Japan, as well as Australia, Brazil, and Singapore.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3,630 million, or 11%, over fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 86.0% from 87.4% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3,515 million, or 12%, over fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 85.2% from 86.7% during this period.Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2018 increased $3,426 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 70.1% from 70.0% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $3,311 million, or 14%, over fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.6% from 68.3% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2018 decreased to 31.4% from 31.7% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to fiscal 2017, partially offset by other cost efficiencies in fiscal 2018. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 increased $444 million, or 12%, over fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.6% from 10.8% during this period.General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2018 increased $270 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 6.1% during this period. Pension Settlement Charge We recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 35Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2018 increased $1,208 million, or 26%, over fiscal 2017. The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin in fiscal 2017 by 150 basis points. Excluding the effect of this charge, operating margin for fiscal 2018 was 14.8%, flat with fiscal 2017. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2018 2017 OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin Increase(Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology$1,368 17% $1,049 15% $319Financial Services1,353 16 1,207 16 145Health & Public Service756 11 773 13 (17)Products1,650 15 1,559 16 91Resources715 13 555 11 160Pension Settlement Charge (1)— — (510) — 510Operating Income (GAAP)$5,841 14.8% $4,633 13.3% $1,208Pension Settlement Charge (1)— 510 (510)Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP)$5,841 14.8% $5,142 14.8% $699 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1)Represents the pension settlement charge related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2018 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth.•Health & Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower consulting contract profitability.•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability.•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth.Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. During fiscal 2018, other expense increased $31 million over fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses.Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 27.4%, compared with 21.3% for fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 23.0%. Absent the pension settlement charge of $510 million and related tax impact of $198 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0%. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, as described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), beginning in fiscal 2019 we will recognize incremental income tax expense as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-16. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational 36Table of ContentsStructure.” Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2018 decreased $35 million, or 18%, from fiscal 2017, primarily due to the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, which decreased the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $6.34 for fiscal 2018, compared with $5.44 for fiscal 2017. The $0.90 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 by $0.40. The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by $0.47. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.74 and $5.91 for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.83. This increase was due to increases of $0.82 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.05 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from lower non-operating income and $0.02 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interest. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 37Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncreaseU.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalNet Revenues for Fiscal 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$6,885 $6,616 4% 4% 20% 20%Financial Services7,394 7,031 5 7 21 21Health & Public Service6,178 5,987 3 3 18 18Products9,500 8,395 13 14 27 26Resources4,847 4,839 — 1 14 15Other46 15 n/m n/m — —TOTAL NET REVENUES34,850 32,883 6% 7% 100% 100%Reimbursements1,915 1,915 — TOTAL REVENUES$36,765 $34,798 6% GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS (1) North America$16,291 $15,653 4% 4% 47% 48%Europe12,002 11,512 4 8 34 35Growth Markets6,557 5,717 15 12 19 17TOTAL NET REVENUES$34,850 $32,883 6% 7% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$18,754 $17,868 5% 6% 54% 54%Outsourcing16,096 15,015 7 8 46 46TOTAL NET REVENUES$34,850 $32,883 6% 7% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.

Net Revenues The following net revenues commentary discusses local currency net revenue changes for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016: Operating Groups •Communications, Media & Technology net revenues increased 4% in local currency, led by Software & Platforms in North America, as well as growth across all industry groups in Growth Markets. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Communications & Media in Europe, as disruptions in the market continue to impact demand. •Financial Services net revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by Banking & Capital Markets in Europe and Growth Markets. •Health & Public Service net revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by Public Service in Growth Markets and Europe. •Products net revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by very strong growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, as well as Life Sciences in North America and Industrial in Europe. 38Table of Contents•Resources net revenues increased 1% in local currency, led by Utilities in Europe, partially offset by declines in Energy across all geographic regions. Geographic Regions •North America net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by the United States. •Europe net revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as France, Spain and Switzerland. •Growth Markets net revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by Japan, as well as Australia, Singapore and China. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $2,146 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.4% from 86.2% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $2,145 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.7% from 85.4% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2017 increased $1,215 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.0% from 70.5% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $1,214 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 68.3% from 68.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2017 increased to 31.7% from 31.3% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2017 was principally due to lower labor costs as a percentage of net revenues, compared to fiscal 2016. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 increased $174 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.8% from 10.9% during this period.General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2017 increased $247 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2016, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.1% from 5.7% during this period. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was principally due to higher technology and facilities costs, as well as higher acquisition-related costs.Pension Settlement Charge We recorded a pension settlement charge of $510 million during fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan. For additional information, see Note 10 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 39Table of ContentsOperating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2017 decreased $178 million, or 4%, from fiscal 2016.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2017 was similar to that disclosed for net revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2017, each operating group experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth. •Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth. •Health & Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower outsourcing contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenues. •Products operating income increased principally due to very strong revenue growth, as well as higher consulting contract profitability. •Resources operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and a decline in consulting revenue. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. During fiscal 2017, other expense decreased $31 million from fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Businesses We recorded a gain from the Navitaire divestiture of $548 million and a gain from the Duck Creek partial divestiture of $301 million during fiscal 2016. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 40Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 21.3%, compared with 22.4% for fiscal 2016. Absent the pension settlement charge of $510 million and related tax impact of $198 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0%. Absent the gain on sale of businesses of $849 million and related tax impact of $104 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 would have been 24.2%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes, other adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, and the recognition of excess tax benefits from share based payments as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. This was partially offset by a net increase to prior-year non-U.S. tax liabilities, primarily related to a final assessment of prior-year taxes in Switzerland. The fiscal 2016 effective tax rate also benefited from the final determination of prior-year U.S. taxes. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., and prior to March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc. See “Business—Organizational Structure and History.” Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017 decreased $48 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2016. The decrease was due to lower net income of $715 million, primarily driven by the pension settlement charge recorded during fiscal 2017 as well as the gain on sale of businesses recorded during fiscal 2016. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $5.44 for fiscal 2017, compared with $6.45 for fiscal 2016. The $1.01 decrease in our diluted earnings per share included both the impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by $0.47 and the impact of the gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $5.91 and $5.34 for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.57 due to increases of $0.38 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.09 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.06 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.04 from lower non-operating expense. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 41Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility. In addition, we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends; •acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. As of August 31, 2018, Cash and cash equivalents were $5.1 billion, compared with $4.1 billion as of August 31, 2017. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2018 2017 2016 2018 to 2017 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$6,027 $4,973 $4,667 $1,054Investing activities(1,250) (2,234) (610) 984Financing activities(3,709) (3,560) (3,489) (149)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(134) 42 (23) (176)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$934 $(779) $545 $1,713Operating activities: The $1,054 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and lower tax disbursements, as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities, including lower spending on certain compensation payments.Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities decreased $984 million due to lower spending on business acquisitions and investments, partially offset by higher spending on property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Financing activities: The $149 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as the purchase of additional interests in consolidated subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.Borrowing Facilities See Note 8 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Share Purchases and Redemptions We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2019. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing 42Table of Contentscapital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. For additional information, see Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Subsequent EventsSee Note 13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2018, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt $25 $5 $9 $11 $—Operating leases 3,651 598 1,018 750 1,286Retirement obligations (2) 100 11 22 20 47Purchase obligations and other commitments (3) 184 64 97 23 —Total $3,960 $678 $1,146 $804 $1,333_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (2)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (3)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 43Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Swedish krona—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/Indian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 7 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2018, it was anticipated that approximately $21 million of net losses, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $483 million and $494 million as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2018 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Other Market Risk The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2018. Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 17:35:27.011317
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2019,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2019. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts, to renew and extend existing contracts, and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results.Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues). This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Summary of Results Revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 8.5% in local currency compared to fiscal 2018. Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During fiscal 2019, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Resources, strong in Communications, Media & Technology, Products, and Health & Public Service and modest in Financial Services. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Growth Markets, strong in North America and solid in Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in both outsourcing and consulting during fiscal 2019. While the business environment remained competitive, we experienced pricing improvement in several areas of our business. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.In our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to fiscal 2018. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in Resources, strong growth in Health & Public Service, Products and Communications, Media & Technology and modest growth in Financial Services. Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.In our outsourcing business, revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to fiscal 2018. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in Resources, Communications, Media & Technology and Products, solid growth in Financial Services and modest 27Table of Contentsgrowth in Health & Public Service. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2019, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 3% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our full fiscal 2020 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 1% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for fiscal 2019 was 91%, consistent with fiscal 2018. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 492,000 as of August 31, 2019, compared to approximately 459,000 as of August 31, 2018. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2019 was 17%, up from 15% in fiscal 2018. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2019 was 30.8%, compared with 30.5% for fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2018.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.2% for fiscal 2019, compared with 16.1% for fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were flat. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for fiscal 2019 was 14.6%, compared with 14.4% for fiscal 2018.Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets of $2.1 billion, and we will recognize incremental income tax expense going forward as these deferred tax assets are utilized. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 28Table of ContentsThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 22.5%, compared with 27.4% for fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 23.0%. For additional information, see Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Diluted earnings per share were $7.36 for fiscal 2019, compared with $6.34 for fiscal 2018. The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.40 in fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.74 for fiscal 2018. We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in fiscal 2018, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these changes and our financial performance when comparing these periods. Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 8 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”BookingsNew bookings for fiscal 2019 were $45.5 billion, with consulting bookings of $24.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $20.8 billion. We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.29Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over-time or at a point-in-time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion. We measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs. We continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience. Additionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. Our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. For additional information, see Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 and a U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2019. The Tax Act’s “base erosion and anti-abuse tax” provision, and regulations issued thereunder, adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. 30Table of ContentsNo taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings. For additional information, see Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.Revenues by Segment/Operating Group Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. In addition to reporting revenues by operating group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. Generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. 31Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018 Revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncrease (Decrease)U.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalRevenues for Fiscal 2019 2018 (1) 2019 2018 (1) (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$8,757 $8,230 6 % 9% 20% 20%Financial Services8,494 8,566 (1) 3 20 21Health & Public Service7,161 6,878 4 6 17 17Products12,005 11,338 6 9 28 28Resources6,772 5,942 14 18 16 14Other26 39 n/m n/m — —TOTAL REVENUES$43,215 $40,993 5 % 8.5% 100% 100%GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS North America$19,986 $18,460 8 % 9% 46% 45%Europe14,681 14,626 — 5 34 36Growth Markets8,548 7,906 8 14 20 19TOTAL REVENUES$43,215 $40,993 5 % 8.5% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$24,177 $22,979 5 % 8% 56% 56%Outsourcing19,038 18,014 6 9 44 44TOTAL REVENUES$43,215 $40,993 5 % 8.5% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and eliminated our net revenues presentation. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. In addition, we updated operating group results for fiscal 2018 to include an acquisition previously categorized within Other. Our business in the United States represented 44%, 43% and 45% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other country individually comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues during these periods. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018: Operating Groups •Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by growth in Software & Platforms across all geographic regions, led by North America.•Financial Services revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by growth in Insurance across all geographic regions and Banking & Capital Markets in Growth Markets, partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in Europe.•Health & Public Service revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service in North America and Europe.•Products revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services in Europe and Growth Markets and Life Sciences in North America.32Table of Contents•Resources revenues increased 18% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions.Geographic Regions •North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States.•Europe revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by Italy, the United Kingdom and Ireland.•Growth Markets revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as Brazil and China.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2019 increased $1,816 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.4% from 85.6% during this period.Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2019 increased $1,401 million, or 5%, over fiscal 2018, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.2% from 69.5% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2019 increased to 30.8% from 30.5% in fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2018. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2019 increased $251 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2018, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.3% from 10.2% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2019 increased $164 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2018, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 5.9% during this period.Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2019 increased $406 million, or 7%, over fiscal 2018.Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2019 2018 (1) OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin Increase(Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology$1,555 18% $1,380 17% $175Financial Services1,238 15 1,365 16 (128)Health & Public Service739 10 766 11 (27)Products1,720 14 1,664 15 56Resources1,053 16 724 12 330TOTAL$6,305 14.6% $5,899 14.4% $406 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.(1) Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Certain components of pension service costs were reclassified from Operating expenses to Non-operating expenses. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2019 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.•Financial Services operating income decreased as higher consulting contract profitability and revenue growth were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.33Table of Contents•Health & Public Service operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 22.5%, compared with 27.4% for fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 23.0%. The lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and lower expense for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16 and lower tax benefits from share-based payments. For additional information, see Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiary. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2019 decreased $88 million, or 57%, from fiscal 2018, due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage in March 2018 from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $7.36 for fiscal 2019, compared with $6.34 for fiscal 2018. The $1.02 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 by $0.40. Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 increased $0.62 compared with fiscal 2018, due to increases of $0.48 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.05 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.05 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, and $0.04 from lower non-operating expense. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 34Table of ContentsResults of Operations for Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) were as follows: Fiscal PercentIncreaseU.S. Dollars PercentIncreaseLocalCurrency Percent of TotalRevenues for Fiscal 2018 (1) 2017 (1) 2018 (1) 2017 (1) (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology$8,230 $7,097 16% 14% 20% 20%Financial Services8,566 7,654 12 8 21 21Health & Public Service6,878 6,361 8 7 17 18Products11,338 9,922 14 11 28 27Resources5,942 5,096 17 13 14 14Other39 46 n/m n/m — —TOTAL REVENUES$40,993 $36,177 13% 10% 100% 100%GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS (2) North America$18,460 $16,889 9% 9% 45% 47%Europe14,626 12,471 17 9 36 34Growth Markets7,906 6,816 16 16 19 19TOTAL REVENUES$40,993 $36,177 13% 10% 100% 100%TYPE OF WORK Consulting$22,979 $20,080 14% 11% 56% 56%Outsourcing18,014 16,096 12 9 44 44TOTAL REVENUES$40,993 $36,177 13% 10% 100% 100%_______________ n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and eliminated our net revenues presentation. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. In addition, we updated operating group results for fiscal 2018 to include an acquisition previously categorized within Other. (2)Effective September 1, 2017, we revised the reporting of our geographic regions as follows: North America (the United States and Canada), Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). Four countries, including Russia, were previously in Growth Markets, but are now included in Europe. Fiscal 2017 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017: Operating Groups •Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 14% in local currency, driven by growth across all geographic regions in Software & Platforms and Communications & Media, led by Software & Platforms in North America. •Financial Services revenues increased 8% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Banking & Capital Markets in Europe and Growth Markets. •Health & Public Service revenues increased 7% in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service across all geographic regions and Health in North America. •Products revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by growth across all geographic regions, in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Industrial. 35Table of Contents•Resources revenues increased 13% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions led by Chemicals & Natural Resources and Energy. Geographic Regions •North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States. •Europe revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by Germany, Italy, France, Ireland and Spain. •Growth Markets revenues increased 16% in local currency, led by Japan, as well as Australia, Brazil, and Singapore. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $4,108 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 85.6% during this period.Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2018 increased $3,394 million, or 14%, over fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.5% from 69.4% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2018 decreased to 30.5% from 30.6% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to fiscal 2017, partially offset by other cost efficiencies in fiscal 2018. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 increased $444 million, or 12%, over fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 10.2% from 10.4% during this period.General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2018 increased $271 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 5.9% during this period. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2018 increased $707 million, or 14%, over fiscal 2017. Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Fiscal 2018 (1) 2017 (1) OperatingIncome OperatingMargin OperatingIncome OperatingMargin Increase(Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology$1,380 17% $1,057 15% $323Financial Services1,365 16 1,256 16 109Health & Public Service766 11 715 11 51Products1,664 15 1,573 16 90Resources724 12 589 12 134TOTAL$5,899 14.4% $5,191 14.4% $707 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1)Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Certain components of pension service costs were reclassified from Operating expenses to Non-operating expenses. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2018 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017: •Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. •Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth. 36Table of Contents•Health & Public Service operating income decreased primarily due to lower consulting contract profitability. •Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability. •Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. During fiscal 2018, other expense increased $40 million over fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. Pension Settlement Charge We recorded a pension settlement charge of $509,793 during fiscal 2017 as a result of the termination of our U.S. pension plan. For additional information, see Note 11 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 27.4%, compared with 21.3% for fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 would have been 23.0%. Absent the pension settlement charge of $510 million and related tax impact of $198 million, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 would have been 23.0%. For additional information, see Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2018 decreased $35 million, or 18%, from fiscal 2017, primarily due to the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, which decreased the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $6.34 for fiscal 2018, compared with $5.44 for fiscal 2017. The $0.90 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 by $0.40. The impact of the pension settlement charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 by $0.47. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.74 and $5.91 for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.83. This increase was due to increases of $0.82 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.05 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from lower non-operating income and $0.02 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interest. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in fiscal 2018 and the pension settlement charge in fiscal 2017, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these changes and our financial performance when comparing these periods.37Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. We could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends; •acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. As of August 31, 2019, Cash and cash equivalents were $6.1 billion, compared with $5.1 billion as of August 31, 2018. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Fiscal 2019 2018 2019 to 2018 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$6,627 $6,027 $600Investing activities(1,756) (1,250) (506)Financing activities(3,767) (3,709) (58)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(39) (134) 95Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,065 $934 $131Operating activities: The $600 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by higher tax disbursements. Investing activities: The $506 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Financing activities: The $58 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as an increase in purchases of shares, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from share issuances and a decrease in the purchase of additional interests in consolidated subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 14 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.Borrowing Facilities See Note 9 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Share Purchases and Redemptions We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2020. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors 38Table of Contentsmay change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. For additional information, see Note 14 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Subsequent EventsSee Note 14 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2019, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1) Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years (in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt $23 $6 $11 $6 $—Operating leases 3,840 688 1,114 792 1,246Retirement obligations (2) 95 10 20 20 44Purchase obligations and other commitments (3) 286 206 61 12 6Total $4,244 $910 $1,206 $830 $1,296_______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, see Note 10 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (2)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (3)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 39Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, and U.S. dollar/Chinese yuan—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Income Statements. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/Indian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 8 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2019, it was anticipated that approximately $34 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $509 million and $483 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2019 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Other Market Risk The privately held companies in which we invest are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2019. Equity Price Risk The equity price risk associated with our marketable equity securities that are subject to market price volatility is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",2023-12-30 17:35:27.202902
1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2020” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2020. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.Change in Reportable SegmentsEffective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. For additional information, see our Form 8-K filed on January 13, 2020.Overview The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant loss of life, disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide, causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty. This disruption and uncertainty has had and continues to have a significant adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results. For fiscal 2020, our revenues grew 3% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency, a decrease compared to the revenue growth experienced in fiscal 2019. Revenues for the first half of fiscal 2020 grew 7% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and during the second half of fiscal 2020, our revenues declined 1% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. The pandemic impacted almost all aspects of our business and forced us to quickly adapt the way we operate. As described below, we took actions to shift the majority of our workforce to a remote working environment to ensure the continuity of our business, including the sales and delivery of services to our clients, and to respond to a rapidly changing demand environment from our clients.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we enabled approximately 95% of our global workforce to work from home and suspended substantially all business travel. We continue to develop and implement our comprehensive plan to return to our and our clients’ offices where permissible, with our people’s safety and the needs of our clients guiding how we manage our phased transition.We experienced reduced demand for our services during the second half of fiscal 2020 as some clients reprioritized and delayed certain work as a result of the pandemic, particularly in the Travel, Retail, Energy, High Tech and Industrial industries and primarily for our consulting services. We also experienced increased demand in the Public Service, Software & Platforms and Life Sciences industries and from clients across all of our industry groups in connection with their digital transformations, the adoption of cloud technologies and security-related services. In this current market, the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services while deploying skilled teams of professionals effectively.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2020 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations29For further information on the impact to our results for fiscal 2020, please see “Summary of Results” below. For a discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Summary of Results Revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced revenues approximately 1%. During fiscal 2020, revenue growth in local currency was strong in Growth Markets, solid in North America and flat in Europe. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service, modest in Products, Communications, Media & Technology and Financial Services and flat in Resources. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in outsourcing and modest in consulting during fiscal 2020. The business environment remained competitive, and the changes in demand have led to increased pricing pressure, particularly for our consulting services. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.In our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2020 were flat in U.S. dollars and increased 2% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced consulting revenues approximately 2%. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth in Growth Markets and modest growth in North America, partially offset by a modest decline in Europe. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.In our outsourcing business, revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth across all geographic markets. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen, and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2020, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2021 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 2% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for fiscal 2020 was 90%, down from 91% in fiscal 2019. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, increased to approximately 506,000 as of August 31, 2020, compared to approximately 492,000 as of August 31, 2019. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2020 was 12%, down from 17% in fiscal 2019. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations30Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2020 was 31.5%, compared with 30.8% for fiscal 2019. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2019.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for fiscal 2020, compared with 16.2% for fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for fiscal 2020 was 14.7%, compared with 14.6% for fiscal 2019.During fiscal 2020, we recorded gains of $332 million and $52 million in tax expense related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 23.5%, compared with 22.5% for fiscal 2019. Absent the $332 million gains on an investment and related $52 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 would have been 23.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $7.89 for fiscal 2020, compared with $7.36 for fiscal 2019. The $280 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.43 in fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $7.46 for fiscal 2020.We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of gains related to an investment in fiscal 2020, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of this item and our performance in comparison to the prior period.Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”BookingsNew bookings for fiscal 2020 were $49.6 billion, with consulting bookings of $25.8 billion and outsourcing bookings of $23.7 billion, compared to $45.5 billion in fiscal 2019, with consulting bookings of $24.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $20.8 billion. We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in the performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2020 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations31Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over-time or at a point-in-time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion. We measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs. We continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience. Additionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. Our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. For additional information, see Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 and a U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2019. The Tax Act’s “base erosion and anti-abuse tax” provision, and regulations issued thereunder, adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses.Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items. Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2020 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations32No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. See Note 7 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and Note 16 (Segment Reporting) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further details regarding the change in our reportable segments.In addition to reporting revenues by geographic markets, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations33Results of Operations for Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources, which we now refer to as our industry groups.Revenues by geographic market, industry group and type of work are as follows: FiscalPercentIncrease (Decrease)U.S. DollarsPercentIncreaseLocalCurrencyPercent of TotalRevenues for Fiscal(in millions of U.S. dollars)20202019 (1)20202019 (1)GEOGRAPHIC MARKETSNorth America$20,982 $19,986 5 %5 %47 %46 %Europe14,402 14,696 (2)— 32 34 Growth Markets8,943 8,533 5 8 20 20 TOTAL REVENUES$44,327 $43,215 3 %4 %100 %100 %INDUSTRY GROUPSCommunications, Media & Technology$8,883 $8,757 1 %3 %20 %20 %Financial Services8,518 8,494 — 2 19 20 Health & Public Service8,023 7,161 12 13 18 17 Products12,272 12,005 2 3 28 28 Resources6,612 6,772 (2)— 15 16 Other19 26 n/mn/m— — TOTAL REVENUES$44,327 $43,215 3 %4 %100 %100 %TYPE OF WORKConsulting$24,227 $24,177 — %2 %55 %56 %Outsourcing20,100 19,038 6 7 45 44 TOTAL REVENUES$44,327 $43,215 3 %4 %100 %100 %n/m = not meaningfulAmounts in table may not total due to rounding(1)Effective September 1, 2019 we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of one country from Growth Markets to Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Revenues Revenues were impacted by a reduction of approximately 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs in fiscal 2020 across all markets. The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019: Geographic Markets •North America revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Life Sciences, Software & Platforms, Health and Banking & Capital Markets. These increases were partially offset by declines in Chemicals & Natural Resources and High Tech. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.•Europe revenues were flat in local currency, led by growth in Life Sciences, Software & Platforms, Chemicals & Natural Resources and Health. These increases were partially offset by declines in Banking & Capital Markets, Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and High Tech. Revenues were led by growth in Italy and Germany, partially offset by declines in the United Kingdom, Spain and France.•Growth Markets revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by growth in Software & Platforms, Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service, Chemicals & Natural Resources, Industrial and Life Sciences. Revenue growth was driven by Japan, as well as Brazil.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $903 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2019, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.3% from 85.4% during this period.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2020 FORM 10-KItem 7.

Gross margin for fiscal 2020 increased to 31.5% from 30.8% in fiscal 2019. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2019.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2020 increased $178 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.4% from 10.3% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2020 increased $274 million, or 11%, over fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.4% from 5.9% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs compared to fiscal 2019.Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2020 increased $209 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2019. Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources.Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Fiscal 20202019(in millions of U.S. dollars)OperatingIncomeOperatingMarginOperatingIncomeOperatingMarginIncrease (Decrease)North America$3,170 15 %$3,107 16 %$62 Europe1,799 12 %2,013 14 (214)Growth Markets1,545 17 %1,184 14 360 TOTAL$6,514 14.7 %$6,305 14.6 %$209 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The reduction in travel costs during fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact on operating income. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019: •North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues.•Europe operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues.•Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2020 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations35Other Income (Expense), netOther income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2020, other income (expense) increased $342 million over fiscal 2019, primarily due to gains of $332 million related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 23.5%, compared with 22.5% for fiscal 2019. Absent the $332 million gains on an investment and related $52 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 would have been 23.9%. The higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiary. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $7.89 for fiscal 2020, compared with $7.36 for fiscal 2019. The $280 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.43 in fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $7.46 for fiscal 2020. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors:Earnings Per ShareFiscal 2020FY19 As Reported$7.36 Gains on an investment, net of tax0.43 Revenue and operating results0.24 Lower share count0.03 Net Income attributable to non-controlling interest(0.01)Non-operating income(0.02)Higher effective tax rate(0.14)FY20 As Reported$7.89 Results of Operations for Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2018 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2020 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations36Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. We could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends; •acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. As of August 31, 2020, Cash and cash equivalents were $8.4 billion, compared with $6.1 billion as of August 31, 2019. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: FiscalChange(in millions of U.S. dollars)20202019Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$8,215 $6,627 $1,588 Investing activities(1,895)(1,756)(139)Financing activities(4,049)(3,767)(282)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents17 (39)56 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$2,288 $1,065 $1,223 Operating activities: The $1,588 million increase in operating cash flows was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, contract assets and deferred revenues). Investing activities: The $139 million increase in cash used was due to higher spending on business acquisitions, partially offset by increased proceeds from investments. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Financing activities: The $282 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.Borrowing Facilities See Note 10 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Share Purchases and Redemptions We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2021. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2020 FORM 10-KItem 7.

The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Subsequent EventsSee Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Obligations and Commitments As of August 31, 2020, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by periodContractual Cash Obligations (1)TotalLess than1 year1-3 years3-5 yearsMore than5 years(in millions of U.S. dollars)Long-term debt and related interest$75 $8 $17 $8 $43 Operating leases3,949 771 1,202 828 1,149 Retirement obligations (2)91 10 20 19 42 Purchase obligations and other commitments (3)348 203 100 40 5 Total$4,463 $992 $1,339 $895 $1,239 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1)The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (2)Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for active partners after May 15, 2001. (3)Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2020 FORM 10-KItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk38Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/Indian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2020, it was anticipated that approximately $62 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $592 million and $509 million as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2020 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Equity Investment RiskOur non-marketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments.Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2020.

1467373,ACN,Accenture plc,2021,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations29Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2021” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2021. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.Overview Accenture plc is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We help our clients build their digital core, transform their operations, and accelerate revenue growth—creating tangible value across their enterprises at speed and scale. Highlights from fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 included:•Revenues of $50.5 billion, representing 14% growth in U.S. dollars and 11% growth in local currency;•New bookings of $59.3 billion, an increase of 20% in U.S. dollars;•Operating margin of 15.1%, a 40 basis point expansion from fiscal 2020; •R&D spend of $1.1 billion; and•Cash returned to shareholders of $5.9 billion, including share purchases of $3.7 billion and dividends of $2.2 billion.In fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business operations and financial results. We saw strong demand across our business in the second half of the year as customers accelerated their digital transformation. Revenues for the second half of fiscal 2021 grew 22% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2020.Summary of Results Revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to fiscal 2020. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced revenues approximately 1%. During fiscal 2021, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in North America and Growth Markets and strong in Europe. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services and Products and slight in Resources. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and strong in consulting during fiscal 2021. The business environment remained competitive. In many areas, our pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, was lower.In our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 13% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to fiscal 2020. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced consulting revenues Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations30approximately 2%. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2021 was led by very strong growth in Growth Markets and strong growth in North America and Europe. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences.In our outsourcing business, revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency compared to fiscal 2020. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2021 was led by very strong growth in North America and Growth Markets and strong growth in Europe. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen, and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during fiscal 2021, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 3% higher than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2022 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 0.5% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for fiscal 2021 was 93%, up from 90% in fiscal 2020. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 624,000 as of August 31, 2021, compared to 506,000 as of August 31, 2020. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions. For fiscal 2021, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 14%, up from 12% in fiscal 2020. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 19%, up from 17% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of people to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2021 was 32.4%, compared with 31.5% for fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2021 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs, including a one-time bonus for all employees below the managing director level in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 17.3% for fiscal 2021, compared with 16.8% for fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher non-payroll costs. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for fiscal 2021 was 15.1%, compared with 14.7% for fiscal 2020.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations31During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $271 million and $332 million and related tax expense of $41 million and $52 million, respectively, related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 22.8% and 23.5%, respectively. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and 2020 would have been 23.1% and 23.9%, respectively.Diluted earnings per share were $9.16 for fiscal 2021, compared with $7.89 for fiscal 2020. The $230 million and $280 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 and $0.43 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $8.80 and $7.46 for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of gains related to an investment in fiscal 2021 and 2020, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period.Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”BookingsNew bookings for fiscal 2021 were $59.3 billion, with consulting bookings of $30.6 billion and outsourcing bookings of $28.7 billion, compared to $49.6 billion in fiscal 2020, with consulting bookings of $25.8 billion and outsourcing bookings of $23.7 billion. We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations32Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion. We measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs. We continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience. Additionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. Our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. For additional information, see Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items. No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations33As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources.In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020: Geographic Markets •North America revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms and Banking & Capital Markets. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Energy. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.•Europe revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets, Software & Platforms, Industrial and Life Sciences. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Switzerland.•Growth Markets revenues increased 11% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by Japan.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2021 increased $5,098 million, or 13%, over fiscal 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.9% from 85.3% during this period.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 7.

Gross margin for fiscal 2021 increased to 32.4% from 31.5% in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs, including a one-time bonus for all employees below the managing director level in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2021 increased $662 million, or 14%, over fiscal 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.5% from 10.4% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2021 increased $618 million, or 22%, over fiscal 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.8% from 6.4% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher non-payroll costs.Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2021 increased $1,108 million, or 17%, over fiscal 2020. Operating margin for fiscal 2021 was 15.1%, compared with 14.7% for fiscal 2020.Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Fiscal 20212020(in millions of U.S. dollars)OperatingIncomeOperatingMarginOperatingIncomeOperatingMarginIncrease (Decrease)North America$3,908 16 %$3,170 15 %$738 Europe2,236 13 1,799 12 437 Growth Markets1,477 15 1,545 17 (67)TOTAL$7,622 15.1 %$6,514 14.7 %$1,108 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2021 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The reduction in travel costs during fiscal 2021 had a favorable impact on operating income. In addition, during fiscal 2021 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher labor costs, including a one-time bonus in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020: •North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, higher consulting contract profitability and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues.•Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.•Growth Markets operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations36Other Income (Expense), netOther income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2021, other income (expense) decreased $59 million from fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower gains on investments, including lower gains related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, partially offset by lower foreign currency losses. For additional information on investments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 22.8%, compared with 23.5% for fiscal 2020. Absent the $271 million and $332 million gains on an investment and related $41 million and $52 million in tax expense, our effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 would have been 23.1% and 23.9%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiary. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $9.16 for fiscal 2021, compared with $7.89 for fiscal 2020. The $230 million and $280 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 and $0.43 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $8.80 and $7.46 for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors:Earnings Per ShareFiscal 2021FY20 As Reported$7.89 Revenue and operating results1.30 Lower effective tax rate0.09 Lower share count0.03 Net Income attributable to noncontrolling interests(0.01)Non-operating income(0.07)Lower gains on an investment, net of tax(0.07)FY21 As Reported$9.16 Results of Operations for Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2019 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations37Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. We could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;•acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. As of August 31, 2021, Cash and cash equivalents were $8.2 billion, compared with $8.4 billion as of August 31, 2020. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: FiscalChange(in millions of U.S. dollars)20212020Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$8,975 $8,215 $760 Investing activities(4,310)(1,895)(2,415)Financing activities(4,926)(4,049)(877)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents14 17 (3)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(247)$2,288 $(2,536)Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Operating activities: The $760 million increase in operating cash flows was due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Investing activities: The $2,415 million increase in cash used was due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments, partially offset by increased proceeds from investments. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Financing activities: The $877 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.Borrowing Facilities See Note 10 (Borrowings and Indebtedness) and Note 8 (Leases) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Share Purchases and Redemptions We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2022. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 7.

The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Subsequent EventsSee Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-KItem 6A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk39Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound and U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee and Euro/Indian rupee, typically have maturities not exceeding three years and are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2021, it was anticipated that approximately $104 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $469 million and $592 million as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2021 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Equity Investment RiskOur non-marketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments.Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluations of privately held companies are based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2021.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk40We record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values.The carrying values of our investments accounted for under the equity method generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes; however, these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.",2023-12-30 17:35:13.425054

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” the “Company,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2022” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2022. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.Overview Accenture plc is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale.Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business, particularly with regard to wage inflation and increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. During fiscal 2022, we disposed of our business in Russia and recorded a non-operating loss of $96 million. We do not have a business in Ukraine or Belarus.Key Metrics We saw very strong demand across our business in fiscal 2022 as our clients continue their digital transformations. Key metrics for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 included:•Revenues of $61.6 billion, representing 22% growth in U.S. dollars and 26% growth in local currency;•New bookings of $71.7 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currency;•Operating margin of 15.2%, a 10 basis point expansion; •Diluted earnings per share of $10.71, an increase of 16.9% over $9.16 for fiscal 2021, including a $0.15 per share or 2% negative impact from the disposition of our business in Russia; and•Cash returned to shareholders of $6.6 billion, including share purchases of $4.1 billion and dividends of $2.5 billion.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7.

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.Revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 22% in U.S. dollars and 26% in local currency compared to fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2022, revenue growth in local currency was very strong across all geographic markets, industry groups and types of work. In our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 25% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currency compared to fiscal 2021. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in Europe, Growth Markets and North America. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences.In our outsourcing business, which we also refer to as our managed services business, revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 19% in U.S. dollars and 22% in local currency compared to fiscal 2021. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets, Europe and North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2022, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2023 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 6% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations34People MetricsUtilizationWorkforceAnnualized Voluntary Attrition91%721,000+19%down from 93% in fiscal 2021compared to approximately 624,000 as of August 31, 2021compared to 14% in fiscal 2021Utilization for fiscal 2022 was 91%, down from 93% in fiscal 2021. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 721,000 as of August 31, 2022, compared to approximately 624,000 as of August 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions.During fiscal 2022, we experienced a competitive labor market with high demand for the skills our people have, which contributed to elevated levels of voluntary attrition. For fiscal 2022, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 19%, up from 14% in fiscal 2021. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 20%, flat with 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has been and continues to increase faster than in prior years. In fiscal 2022, we have improved pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, across our business. While we are increasing pricing, as well as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin, the impact of these actions did not in fiscal 2022, and may not in the future, fully offset the impact of the compensation increases, resulting in lower contract profitability.Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.Operating ExpensesThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2022 was 32.0%, compared with 32.4% for fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for fiscal 2022, compared with 17.3% for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs decreased 60 basis points primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs as a percentage of revenues. General and administrative costs increased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenues. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2022 was 15.2%, compared with 15.1% for fiscal 2021.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations35Other Income (Expense), netDuring fiscal 2021, we recorded gains of $271 million and tax expense of $41 million, related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Effective Tax RateThe effective tax rates for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 24.0% and 22.8%, respectively. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 would have been 23.1%.Diluted Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $10.71 for fiscal 2022, including a $0.15 negative impact from the disposition of our business in Russia, compared with $9.16 for fiscal 2021. The $230 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 in fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $8.80 for fiscal 2021.Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Foreign Currency Risk under Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021, excluding the impact of the investment gains, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period.New BookingsFiscalPercent Increase (Decrease) U.S. DollarsPercent Increase (Decrease) Local Currency(in billions of U.S. dollars)20222021Consulting$37.9 $30.6 24 %28 %Outsourcing33.9 28.7 18 23 Total New Bookings$71.7 $59.3 21 %25 %Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations36Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion. We measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services and some non-technology consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs. We continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience. Additionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. Our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. For additional information, see Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items. No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations37As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market Our three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

Revenue growth was driven by the United States.•Europe revenues increased 29% in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.•Growth Markets revenues increased 29% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Japan, Australia and Brazil.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2022 increased $9,315 million, or 22%, over fiscal 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.8% from 84.9% during this period.Operating expenses by category are as follows:Fiscal(in millions of U.S. dollars)20222021Increase (Decrease)Operating Expenses$52,227 84.8 %$42,912 84.9 %$9,315 Cost of services41,893 68.0 34,169 67.6 7,724 Sales and marketing6,108 9.9 5,288 10.5 820 General and administrative costs4,226 6.9 3,454 6.8 772 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations39Cost of Services Cost of services for fiscal 2022 increased $7,724 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 68.0% over 67.6% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2022 decreased to 32.0% from 32.4% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2022 increased $820 million, or 16%, over fiscal 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.9% from 10.5% during this period. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs.General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2022 increased $772 million, or 22%, over fiscal 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.9% over 6.8% during this period.Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2022 increased $1,746 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2021. Operating margin for fiscal 2022 was 15.2%, compared with 15.1% for fiscal 2021.Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Fiscal 20222021(in millions of U.S. dollars)OperatingIncomeOperatingMarginOperatingIncomeOperatingMarginIncrease (Decrease)North America$4,977 17 %$3,908 16 %$1,069 Europe2,437 12 2,236 13 201 Growth Markets1,953 16 1,477 15 476 Total$9,367 15.2 %$7,622 15.1 %$1,746 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2022 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021: •North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.•Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs.•Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.Other Income (Expense), netOther income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2022, Other income (expense) decreased $238 million from fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments. For additional information on investments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Loss on Disposition of Russia BusinessWe recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during fiscal 2022.Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 24.0%, compared with 22.8% for fiscal 2021. Absent the $271 million investment gains and related $41 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 would have been 23.1%. The higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes. For Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations40additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiary. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $10.71 for fiscal 2022, including a $0.15 negative impact from the disposition of our business in Russia, compared with $9.16 for fiscal 2021. The $230 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 in fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $8.80 for fiscal 2021. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors:Earnings Per ShareFiscal 2022FY21 As Reported$9.16 Higher revenue and operating results2.08 Lower non-operating expense (excluding loss on disposition of Russia business)0.06 Lower share count0.05 Higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(0.03)Higher effective tax rate (excluding loss on disposition of Russia business)(0.10)Loss on disposition of Russia business(0.15)Lower gains on an investment, net of tax(0.36)FY22 As Reported$10.71 Results of Operations for Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2020 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations41Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. We could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;•acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. As of August 31, 2022, Cash and cash equivalents were $7.9 billion, compared with $8.2 billion as of August 31, 2021. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: FiscalChange(in millions of U.S. dollars)20222021Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$9,541 $8,975 $566 Investing activities(4,261)(4,310)49 Financing activities(5,311)(4,926)(385)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(248)14 (262)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(278)$(247)$(31)Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Operating activities: The $566 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, including receivables from clients and contract assets. Investing activities: The $49 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments and higher spending on purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Financing activities: The $385 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.Share Purchases and Redemptions We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2023. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.

To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of these arrangements. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk43Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Chinese yuan, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso and U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar, are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, typically have maturities not exceeding three years and are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2022, it was anticipated that approximately $29 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $693 million and $469 million as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2022 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Equity Investment RiskOur non-marketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments.Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluations of privately held companies are based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2022.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk44We record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values.The carrying values of our investments accounted for under the equity method generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes; however, these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.",2023-12-30 17:35:13.853303

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2023” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2023. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.Overview Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and AI with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale.Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending for smaller contracts with a shorter duration, especially for our consulting services. From an industry perspective, we are also experiencing reduced demand particularly in our Communications, Media & Technology industry group.Key Metrics Key metrics for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 are included below. We have presented operating margin and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or “adjusted” basis to exclude the impact of $1,063 million in business optimization costs and, with respect to diluted earnings per share, the impact of a $253 million investment gain recorded during fiscal 2023.

During fiscal 2023, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Growth Markets and Europe and solid in North America. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Resources and Health & Public Service, strong in Products and Financial Services, partially offset by a modest decline in Communications, Media & Technology. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in managed services and modest in consulting during fiscal 2023. The business environment is competitive, and we are experiencing lower pricing across the business. We define pricing as contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.In our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2023 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 3% in local currency compared to fiscal 2022. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2023 was driven by strong growth in Growth Markets and solid growth in Europe, while North America was flat. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. While we continue to experience demand for these services, we are seeing a slower pace and level of client spending, especially for smaller contracts with a shorter duration.In our managed services business, revenues for fiscal 2023 increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency compared to fiscal 2022. Managed services revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2023 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets and Europe and strong growth in North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and cybersecurity-as-a-service (formerly managed security services). In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings.As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2023, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2024 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately equal to our revenue growth in local currency.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations35People MetricsUtilizationWorkforceAnnualized Voluntary Attrition91%733,00013%consistent with fiscal 2022compared to approximately 721,000 as of August 31, 2022compared to 19% in fiscal 2022Utilization for fiscal 2023 was 91%, consistent with fiscal 2022. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 733,000 as of August 31, 2023, compared to approximately 721,000 as of August 31, 2022. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects people added in connection with acquisitions and hiring for specific skills.For fiscal 2023, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 13%, down from 19% in fiscal 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 14%, up from 13% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline operations and transform our nonbillable corporate functions to reduce costs.In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases became effective December 1st of fiscal 2023. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has increased faster than in prior years, but is moderating. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability.Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.Operating ExpensesThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2023 was 32.3%, compared with 32.0% for fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel.Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.9% for fiscal 2023, compared with 16.8% for fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, Sales and marketing costs increased 40 basis points due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. General and administrative costs decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenues. During fiscal 2023, we recorded $1,063 million in business optimization costs primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2023 was 13.7%, compared with 15.2% for fiscal 2022.The business optimization costs recorded during fiscal 2023 reduced operating margin by 170 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for fiscal 2023 increased 20 basis points to 15.4%.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-KItem 7.

For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Effective Tax RateThe effective tax rates for fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 23.4% and 24.0%, respectively. Absent the business optimization costs of $1,063 million and related reduction in tax expense of $247 million, as well as an investment gain of $253 million and related tax expense of $9 million, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.9%.Earnings Per ShareDiluted earnings per share were $10.77 for fiscal 2023, compared with $10.71 for fiscal 2022. The $816 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $1.28 and the $244 million investment gain, net of related taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.38 for fiscal 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $11.67 for fiscal 2023.Our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. Most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. Where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. We seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. For more information on our hedging programs, see Foreign Currency Risk under Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresFor fiscal 2023, we have presented effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share excluding the business optimization costs and investment gain, as well as operating income and operating margin excluding the business optimization costs, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior periods. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations37The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion. We measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services and some non-technology consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs. We continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience. Additionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. Our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. For additional information, see Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items. Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-KItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations38No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. We currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market Our three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and managed services, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Managed services revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. From time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and managed services is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. While we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.

These increases were partially offset by declines in Communications & Media, High Tech, Banking & Capital Markets and Software & Platforms. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.•Europe revenues increased 11% in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, Italy and France.•Growth Markets revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by growth in Chemicals & Natural Resources, Public Service and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Japan.Operating Expenses Operating expenses for fiscal 2023 increased $3,075 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 86.3% compared to 84.8% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to business optimization costs of $1,063 million recorded during fiscal 2023.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-KItem 7.

Gross margin for fiscal 2023 increased to 32.3% compared to 32.0% in fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to fiscal 2022.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense for fiscal 2023 increased $474 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.3% over 9.9% during this period due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues.General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for fiscal 2023 increased $50 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.7% from 6.9% during this period.Business Optimization CostsDuring fiscal 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $1,063 million, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for fiscal 2023 decreased $557 million, or 6%, from fiscal 2022. Operating margin for fiscal 2023 was 13.7%, compared with 15.2% for fiscal 2022. The business optimization costs reduced operating margin by 170 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for fiscal 2023 increased 20 basis points to 15.4%.Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Fiscal 20232022(in millions of U.S. dollars)OperatingIncomeOperatingMarginOperatingIncomeOperatingMarginIncrease (Decrease)North America$4,474 15 %$4,977 17 %$(503)Europe2,333 11 2,437 12 (105)Growth Markets2,004 16 1,953 16 51 Total$8,810 13.7 %$9,367 15.2 %$(557)Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-KItem 7.

In addition, during fiscal 2023 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant for fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022: •North America operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs, including an increase in selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues.•Europe operating income increased due to revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.•Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.Interest IncomeInterest income for fiscal 2023 was $280 million, an increase of $235 million over fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates.Other Income (Expense), netOther income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2023, Other income (expense) increased $169 million over fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher gains on investments, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses. For additional information on investments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Loss on Disposition of Russia BusinessWe recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during fiscal 2022.Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.4%, compared with 24.0% for fiscal 2022. Absent the business optimization costs of $1,063 million and related reduction in tax expense of $247 million, and the investment gain of $253 million and related tax expense of $9 million, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.9%.The slightly lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based payments. For additional information, see Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees have in our Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiary. See “Business—Organizational Structure.” Noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary. Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of Accenture plc. Table of ContentsACCENTURE 2023 FORM 10-KItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations43Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. We could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:•facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;•acquire complementary businesses or technologies;•take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or•develop new services and solutions.As of August 31, 2023, Cash and cash equivalents were $9.0 billion, compared with $7.9 billion as of August 31, 2022. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: FiscalChange(in millions of U.S. dollars)20232022Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$9,524 $9,541 $(17)Investing activities(2,622)(4,261)1,638 Financing activities(5,645)(5,311)(334)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(101)(248)147 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,155 $(278)$1,434 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.Operating activities: The $17 million decrease in operating cash flows were primarily due to higher spending on certain compensation payments, partially offset by higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, contract assets and deferred revenues). Investing activities: The $1,638 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and higher proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments. For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Financing activities: The $334 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as an increase in the net purchase of shares, partially offset by increases in net proceeds from share issuances and net proceeds from borrowings. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.Share Purchases and Redemptions We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2024. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk45Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as counterparties. Certain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/Chinese yuan, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound and U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements. Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our global delivery model. These hedges, the most significant of which are U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, Euro/Indian rupee and U.K. pound/Indian rupee, typically have maturities not exceeding three years and are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of services. As of August 31, 2023, it was anticipated that approximately $3 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately $856 million and $693 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2023 is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments. Equity Investment RiskOur non-marketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments.Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a start-up or development stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The evaluations of privately held companies are based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2023.
