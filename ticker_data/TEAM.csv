1650372,TEAM,Atlassian Corp,2023,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2023 and 2022, and fiscal years 2022, and 2021, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing under “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements,” the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Company OverviewOur mission is to unleash the potential of every team.Our products help teams organize, discuss and complete their work — delivering superior outcomes for their organizations.Our products serve teams of all shapes and sizes, in virtually every industry. Our primary products include Jira Software and Jira Work Management for planning and project management, Confluence for content creation and sharing, Trello for capturing and adding structure to fluid, fast-forming work for teams, Jira Service Management for team service, management and support applications, Jira Align for enterprise agile planning, and Bitbucket for code sharing and management. Together, our products form an integrated system for organizing, discussing and completing shared work, becoming deeply entrenched in how people collaborate and how organizations run.Our mission is possible with a deep investment in product development to create and refine high-quality and versatile products that users love. By making our products affordable for organizations of all sizes and transparently sharing our pricing online for most of our products, we generally do not follow the practice of opaque pricing and ad hoc discounting that is typical in the enterprise software industry. We pursue customer volume, targeting every organization, regardless of size, industry, or geography. This allows us to operate at unusual scale for an enterprise software company, with more than 260,000 customers across virtually every industry sector in approximately 200 countries as of June 30, 2023. Our customers range from small organizations that have adopted one of our products for a small group of users, to over two-thirds of the Fortune 500, many of which use a combination of our products across thousands of users.To reach this expansive market, we primarily distribute and sell our products online where our customers can get started in minutes without the need for assistance. We focus on enabling a self-service, low-friction model that makes it easy for customers to try, adopt and use our products. By making our products simple, powerful, affordable and easy to adopt, we generate demand from word-of-mouth and viral expansion within organizations.Our culture of innovation, transparency and dedication to customer service drives our success in implementing and refining this unique approach. We believe this approach creates a self-reinforcing effect that 47fosters innovation, quality, customer success, and scale. As a result of this strategy, we invest significantly more in research and development activities than in traditional sales activities relative to other enterprise software companies.A substantial majority of our sales are automated through our website, including sales of our products through our solution partners and resellers. For fiscal year 2023, we derived over 40% of our revenue from channel partners’ sales efforts. Our solution partners and resellers primarily focus on customers in regions that require local language support and other customized needs. We plan to continue to invest in our partner programs to help us enter and grow in new markets, complementing our automated, low-touch approach. We generate revenues primarily in the form of subscriptions, maintenance and other sources. Subscription revenues consist primarily of fees earned from subscription-based arrangements for providing customers the right to use our software in a cloud-based-infrastructure that we provide (“Cloud offerings”). We also sell on-premises term license agreements for our Data Center products (“Data Center offerings”), consisting of software licensed for a specified period and support and maintenance service that is bundled with the license for the term of the license period. Subscription revenues also include subscription-based agreements for our premier support services. From time to time, we make changes to our product offerings, prices and pricing plans for our products which may impact the growth rate of our revenue, our deferred revenue balances, and customer retention.Maintenance provides our customers with access to unspecified future updates, upgrades and enhancements and technical product support on an if-and-when-available basis for perpetual license products purchased and operated by our customers on their premises (“Server offerings”). Maintenance revenue combined with our subscription revenue business, through our Cloud and Data Center products, results in a large recurring revenue base. In each of the past three fiscal years, more than 80% of our total revenues have been of a recurring nature from subscription and maintenance fees.Customers typically pay us maintenance fees annually, at the beginning of each contractual year. We typically recognize revenue on the license portion of term license agreements (Data Center offerings) once the customer obtains control of the license, which is generally upon delivery of the license, and for maintenance and subscriptions, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Any invoice amounts or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscriptions or maintenance are included in our deferred revenue balance. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including customer decisions around the timing of renewals, length of contracts and invoice timing within the period. We no longer sell perpetual licenses or upgrades for our Server offerings and plan to end maintenance and support for these Server offerings in February 2024. We will proactively help our customers transition to other versions of our products with our migration tools and programs, customer support teams, and pricing and packaging options.Economic Conditions Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in the global economy on us or our customers. Our business depends on demand for business software applications generally and for collaboration software solutions in particular. We believe that weakening macroeconomic conditions, in part due to rising inflation, increases in interest rates, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted our results of operations during fiscal year 2023. Primarily, we have seen the growth from existing customers moderate during fiscal year 2023. We also saw moderating growth in the rate of conversions from our free to paid products. We believe these events are largely due to customers impacted by weakening economic conditions. The extent to which these risks ultimately impact our business, results of operations, and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.RestructuringOn March 6, 2023, we announced a rebalancing of resources resulting in the elimination of certain roles impacting about 500 full-time employees, or approximately 5% of the Company’s then-current workforce. These actions are part of our initiatives to accelerate progress against our largest growth opportunities. These actions include continuing to invest in strategic areas of the business, and aligning talent to best meet customer needs and business priorities. In addition, we consolidated our leases, including planned subleasing, of several office spaces, to optimize our real estate footprint. We continue to evaluate our real estate needs and may incur additional charges in the future.48A summary of our restructuring charges for fiscal year 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in thousands):Severance and Other Termination BenefitsStock-based CompensationLease ConsolidationTotalCost of revenue$1,011 $288 $7,893 $9,192 Research and development8,279 5,866 29,004 43,149 Marketing and sales7,069 1,815 14,984 23,868 General and administrative8,961 2,306 9,418 20,685 Total$25,320 $10,275 $61,299 $96,894 The execution of these actions, including the related cash payments have been substantially completed as of June 30, 2023. Refer to Note 15, “Restructuring,” to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.Key Business MetricsWe utilize the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.CustomersWe have successfully demonstrated a history of growing both our customer base and spend per customer through growth in users, purchase of new licenses and adoption of new products. We believe that our ability to attract new customers and grow our customer base drives our success as a business.We define the number of customers at the end of any particular period to be the number of organizations with unique domains that have at least one active and paid non-starter license or subscription, with two or more seats. While a single customer may have distinct departments, operating segments, or subsidiaries with multiple active licenses or subscriptions of our products, if the product deployments share a unique domain name, we only include the customer once for purposes of calculating this metric. We define active licenses as those licenses that are under an active maintenance or subscription contract as of period end.Our customers, as defined in this metric, have generated substantially all of our revenue in each of the periods presented. Including single-user accounts and organizations who have only adopted our free or starter products, the active use of our products extends well beyond our more than 260,000 customers. With these customers using our software today, we are able to reach a vast number of users, gather insights to refine our offerings and generate growing revenue by expanding within our customer base. No single customer contributed more than 5% of our total revenues during fiscal year 2023.The following table sets forth our number of customers as of the dates presented: As of June 30, 202320222021Number of customers262,337 242,623 204,754 Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures. Management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used to fund our commitments, repay our debt, and for strategic opportunities, such as reinvesting in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening our financial position. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences among methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the periods presented (in thousands):49 Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 202320222021Net cash provided by operating activities$868,111 $821,044 $789,960 Less: Capital expenditures(25,652)(70,583)(31,520)Free cash flow$842,459 $750,461 $758,440 Free cash flow increased by $92.0 million during fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. The increase of free cash flow was primarily attributable to the increase of net cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in capital expenditures. The increase of net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in cash received from customers, offset by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees, and cash used to pay income taxes.For more information about net cash provided by operating activities, please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Components of Results of OperationsOn September 30, 2022, . Atlassian Corporation Plc, a public company limited by shares, incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, completed a redomestication, which was approved by the shareholders of Atlassian Corporation Plc, resulting in Atlassian Corporation, a Delaware corporation, becoming our publicly traded parent company (the “U.S. Domestication”). In fiscal year 2022 and prior periods, we prepared our financial information in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). As a consequence of becoming a U.S. domestic issuer, beginning with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2022, we are required to present our financial information in accordance with GAAP. The below financial information has been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial information should not be expected to correspond to figures we have previously presented under IFRS.Sources of RevenuesSubscription RevenuesSubscription revenues consist primarily of fees earned from subscription-based arrangements for providing customers the right to use our software in a cloud-based-infrastructure that we provide. We also sell on-premises term license agreements for our Data Center products, which consist of software licensed for a specified period and include support and maintenance services that are bundled with the license for the term of the license period. Subscription revenues also include subscription-based agreements for our premier support services. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number and size of active licenses, the type of product and the price of the licenses. Our subscription-based arrangements generally have a contractual term of one to twelve months, with a majority being one month. For Cloud offerings, subscription revenue is recognized ratably as services are performed, commencing with the date the service is made available to customers. For Data Center products, we recognize revenue upfront for the portion that relates to the delivery of the term license and the support and related revenue is recognized ratably as the services are delivered over the term of the arrangement. Premier support consists of subscription-based arrangements for a higher level of support across different deployment options, and revenue is recognized ratably as the services are delivered over the term of the arrangement.Maintenance RevenuesMaintenance revenues represent fees earned from providing customers unspecified future updates, upgrades and enhancements and technical product support for perpetual license products on an if-and-when-available basis. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support period.Other RevenuesOther revenues primarily include perpetual license revenue and fees received for sales of third-party apps in the Atlassian Marketplace. Technical account management, consulting and training services are also included in other revenues. Perpetual license revenues represent fees earned from the license of software to customers for use on the customer’s premises other than Data Center products. Software is licensed on a perpetual basis. Perpetual license revenues consist of the revenues recognized from sales of licenses to customers. The Company no longer sells perpetual licenses or upgrades for our Server offerings. The Company typically recognized revenue on the license portion of perpetual license arrangements once the customer obtained control of the license, which is generally upon delivery of the license. Revenue from the sale of third-party apps via Atlassian Marketplace is 50recognized on the date of product delivery given that all of our obligations have been met at that time and on a net basis the Company functions as the agent in the relationship. Revenue from technical account management is recognized over the time period that the customer has access to the service. Revenue from consulting and training is recognized over time as the services are performed.We expect subscription revenue to increase and continue to be our primary driver of revenue growth as our customers continue to migrate to our Cloud and Data Center offerings. Migrating our larger customers to the cloud continues to be one of our most important priorities over the coming year. Consistent with our strategy, our Server business is expected to contract. Maintenance revenue is expected to decline as Server customers migrate to our Cloud and Data Center offerings.Cost of RevenuesCost of revenues primarily consists of expenses related to compensation expenses for our employees, including stock-based compensation, hosting our cloud infrastructure, which includes third-party hosting fees and depreciation associated with computer equipment and software; payment processing fees; consulting and contractors costs, associated with our customer support and infrastructure service teams; amortization of acquired intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s developed technology; certain IT program fees; and facilities and related overhead costs. To support our cloud-based infrastructure, we utilize third-party managed hosting facilities. We allocate stock-based compensation based on the expense category in which the employee works. We allocate overhead such as information technology costs, rent and occupancy charges in each expense category based on headcount in that category. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenues and operating expense categories.We expect cost of revenues to increase as we continue to invest in our cloud-based infrastructure to support migrations and our cloud customers.Gross Profit and Gross MarginGross profit is total revenues less total cost of revenues. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenues. Gross margin can fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in product and services mix. We expect gross margin to decrease due to the sales mix shift from Server and Data Center offerings to Cloud offerings. This impact will be primarily driven by increased hosting costs as well as additional personnel costs to support migrations and our cloud customers.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses are classified as research and development, marketing and sales, and general and administrative. For each functional category, the largest component is compensation expenses, which include salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and contractor costs. We allocate overhead such as information technology costs, rent, and occupancy charges in each expense category based on headcount in that category.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our employees, including stock-based compensation, consulting and contractor costs, contract software development costs, facilities and related overhead costs, certain IT program expenses, and restructuring charges. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on building new products, adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing functionality, enhancing our cloud infrastructure and developing our mobile capabilities.Marketing and SalesMarketing and sales expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our employees, including stock-based compensation, marketing and sales programs, consulting and contractor costs, facilities and related overhead costs, certain IT program expenses, and restructuring charges. Marketing programs consist of advertising, promotional events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities such as online lead generation. Sales programs consist of activities and teams focused on supporting our solution partners and resellers, tracking channel sales activity, supporting and servicing our customers by helping them optimize their 51experience and expand the use of our products across their organizations and helping product evaluators learn how they can use our tools most effectively.General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our employees, including stock-based compensation, for finance, legal, human resources and information technology personnel, consulting and contractor costs, certain IT program expenses, other corporate expenses and facilities and related overhead costs, and restructuring charges.Income TaxesProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business.Net LossWe incurred a net loss in fiscal year 2023, primarily attributable to growing our team, specifically focusing on adding research and development personnel to drive continued product innovation, as well as investments in infrastructure to support our Cloud offerings, additional tax expenses due to the recognition of reserves for uncertain tax positions, and restructuring charges associated with the rebalancing of resources and lease consolidation. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the net loss was primarily attributable to marking to fair value of the exchangeable senior notes (the “Notes”) and related capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) and settlements of the Notes and Capped Calls.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations may require judgment.We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation. We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. We typically determine an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. For all performance obligations other than perpetual and term licenses, we are able to determine SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. In instances where performance obligations do not have observable standalone sales, we utilize available information that may include market conditions, pricing strategies, the economic life of the software, and other observable inputs to estimate the price we would charge if the products and services were sold separately.Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and, in certain instances, we estimate customer usage of our services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Variable consideration was not material for the periods presented.52Strategic InvestmentsInvestments in privately held equity securities without readily determinable fair values in which we do not own a controlling interest or have significant influence over are measured using the measurement alternative. In applying the measurement alternative, the carrying value of the investment is measured at cost, less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer in the period of occurrence. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we use the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and require the use of judgment. The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for an identical or similar investment requires significant judgment. In our evaluation, we consider factors such as differences in the rights and preferences of the investments and the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments.We assess our privately held debt and equity securities’ strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee’s product or technology, general market conditions and liquidity considerations. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statements of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.Valuation of Minority Interest in Equity Method InvestmentIn July 2022, we completed a non-cash sale of our controlling interest in Vertical First Trust (“VFT”) to a third-party buyer. VFT was established for the construction project associated with the Company’s new global headquarters in Sydney, Australia. We retained a minority equity interest of 13% in the form of ordinary shares and have significant influence in VFT. VFT was deconsolidated at the time of the sale, and we accounted for our retained equity interest as an equity method investment in our consolidated financial statements.We used our best estimates and assumptions to accurately determine the fair value of our retained equity interest in VFT. The estimation is primarily due to the judgmental nature of the inputs to the valuation model used to measure fair value and the sensitivity to the significant underlying assumptions. Our estimates are inherently uncertain. We used a discounted cash flow model to calculate the fair value of our retained equity interest. The significant inputs to the valuation included observable market inputs, including capitalization rate, discount rate, and other management inputs, including the underlying building practical completion date. These assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions and construction progress.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. When the projected undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded as a component of operating income (expense).Judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. Assumptions and estimates about future values can be subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy.Income TaxWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (i) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary difference will reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected 53future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.In the multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our tax returns are subject to routine audit by the Internal Revenue Service, Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”), and other taxation authorities. These audits at times may produce alternative views regarding certain tax positions taken in the year(s) of review. As a result, we record uncertain tax positions, which require recognition at the time when it is deemed more likely than not that the position in question will be upheld. Although management believes that the judgment and estimates involved are reasonable and that the necessary provisions have been recorded, changes in circumstances or unexpected events could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures, instead requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenditures over five or fifteen years beginning in fiscal year 2023. If not deferred, modified, or repealed, this provision may materially increase future cash taxes.New Accounting Pronouncements Pending AdoptionThe impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.54Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands, except for percentages of total revenues): Fiscal Year Ended June 30,202320222021Revenues: Subscription$2,922,576 83 %$2,096,706 75 %$1,324,064 63 %Maintenance399,738 11 495,077 18 522,971 25 Other212,333 6 211,099 7 242,097 12 Total revenues3,534,647 100 2,802,882 100 2,089,132 100 Cost of revenues633,765 18 452,914 16 331,850 16 Gross profit2,900,882 82 2,349,968 84 1,757,282 84 Operating expenses:Research and development1,869,881 53 1,291,877 46 932,994 45 Marketing and sales769,861 22 535,815 19 371,644 18 General and administrative606,362 17 452,193 16 311,238 14 Total operating expenses3,246,104 92 2,279,885 81 1,615,876 77 Operating income (loss)(345,222)(10)70,083 3 141,406 7 Other income (expense), net14,501 — (501,839)(19)(570,393)(28)Interest income49,732 1 2,284 — 7,158 — Interest expense(30,147)(1)(41,466)(1)(92,586)(4)Loss before provision for income taxes(311,136)(10)(470,938)(17)(514,415)(25)Provision for income taxes(175,625)(4)(48,572)(2)(64,564)(3)Net loss$(486,761)(14)%$(519,510)(19)%$(578,979)(28)%Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022Revenues Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(in thousands, except percentage data)20232022$ Change% ChangeSubscription$2,922,576 $2,096,706 $825,870 39 %Maintenance399,738 495,077 (95,339)(19)Other212,333 211,099 1,234 1 Total revenues$3,534,647 $2,802,882 $731,765 26 %Total revenues increased $731.8 million, or 26%, in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. Growth in total revenues was primarily attributable to increased demand for our products from both new and existing customers. Of total revenues recognized in fiscal year 2023, over 90% was attributable to sales to customer accounts existing on or before June 30, 2022. Our number of total customers increased to 262,337 at June 30, 2023 from 242,623 at June 30, 2022. Subscription revenues increased $825.9 million, or 39%, in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. The increase in subscription revenues was primarily attributable to additional subscriptions from our existing customer base, and customers migrating to cloud-based subscription services and term-based licenses for our Data Center products.Maintenance revenues decreased $95.3 million, or 19%, in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. We no longer offer upgrades to perpetual licenses beginning February 2022, and plan to end maintenance and support for these products in February 2024.55Other revenues increased $1.2 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. The increase in other revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of $29.8 million in revenue from sales of third-party apps through our Atlassian Marketplace and other revenue, offset by a decrease of $28.6 million in perpetual license revenues as we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses for our products beginning February 2021.Total revenues by deployment options were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in thousands, except percentage data)20232022$ Change% ChangeCloud$2,085,498 $1,515,424 $570,074 38 %Data Center819,251 560,319 258,932 46 Server400,519 525,028 (124,509)(24)Marketplace and services229,379 202,111 27,268 13 Total revenues$3,534,647 $2,802,882 $731,765 26 Total revenues by geography were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in thousands, except percentage data)20232022$ Change% ChangeAmericas$1,765,166 $1,408,868 $356,298 25 %EMEA1,366,739 1,077,338 289,401 27 Asia Pacific402,742 316,676 86,066 27 Total revenues$3,534,647 $2,802,882 $731,765 26 Cost of Revenues Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(in thousands, except percentage data)20232022$ Change% ChangeCost of revenues$633,765$452,914$180,851 40 %Gross margin82 %84 % Cost of revenues increased $180.9 million, or 40%, in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022.

The income tax provision for fiscal year 2023 reflects an increase in tax provision primarily attributable to the recognition of a reserve for uncertain tax positions and overall growth in foreign jurisdictions associated with an increase in profit and non-deductible stock-based compensation. Since fiscal year 2020, we have been in unilateral advanced pricing agreement (“APA”) negotiations with the ATO relating to our transfer pricing arrangements between Australia and the U.S. During fiscal year 2023, we discussed with the ATO, for the first time, a framework to finalize our transfer pricing arrangements for the proposed APA period (tax years ended June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2025). 57Given the stage of discussions with the ATO during fiscal year 2023, we recorded a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $110.7 million based upon applying the recognition and measurement thresholds of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Although our recorded tax reserves are the best estimate of our liabilities, differences may occur in the future, depending on final resolution of the APA negotiations. The negotiations are expected to be finalized within the next 12 months.Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0% primarily attributable to the recognition of a reserve for uncertain tax positions, different tax rates in foreign jurisdictions such as Australia, non-deductible stock-based compensation in certain foreign jurisdictions, and full valuation allowances in the U.S. and Australia. See Note 19, “Income Tax,” to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Our assessment is based on all positive and negative evidence related to the realizability of such deferred tax assets. Based on available objective evidence as of June 30, 2023, we will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal, U.S. state, and Australian deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. We intend to maintain the full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation allowance. Our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the expense or benefit from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, changes in valuation allowances, level of profit before tax, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, and changes in our valuation allowances to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax laws, including impacts of the TCJA. The TCJA, enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures, instead requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenditures over five or fifteen years beginning in fiscal year 2023. If not deferred, modified or repealed, this provision may materially increase future cash taxes.A significant amount of our earnings is generated by our Australian subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. See Note 19, “Income Tax,” to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Changes in our global operations could result in changes to our effective tax rates, future cash flows, and overall profitability of our operations.Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 RevenuesFiscal Year Ended June 30,(in thousands, except percentage data)20222021$ Change% ChangeSubscription$2,096,706 $1,324,064 $772,642 58 %Maintenance495,077 522,971 (27,894)(5)Other211,099 242,097 (30,998)(13)Total revenues$2,802,882 $2,089,132 $713,750 34 Total revenues increased $713.8 million, or 34%, in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. Growth in total revenues was primarily attributable to increased demand for our products from both new and existing customers and accelerated short-term demand for on-premises products as a result of customers purchasing ahead of both the discontinuation of new perpetual license sales and price changes for on-premises products during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Of total revenues recognized in fiscal year 2022, over 90% was attributable to sales to customer accounts existing on or before June 30, 2021. Our number of total customers increased to 242,623 at June 30, 2022 from 204,754 at June 30, 2021.Subscription revenues increased $772.6 million, or 58%, in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. The increase in subscription revenues was primarily attributable to additional subscriptions from our existing customer base and accelerated short-term demand for data center products as a result of customers purchasing ahead of price changes during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.Maintenance revenues decreased $27.9 million, or 5%, in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. We no longer offer upgrades to perpetual licenses beginning February 2022, and we plan to end maintenance and support for these products in February 2024.58Other revenues decreased $31.0 million, or 13%, in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. The decrease in other revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease of $54.9 million in perpetual license revenues as we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses for our products beginning February 2021, offset by an increase of $20.2 million in revenue from sales of third-party apps through our Atlassian Marketplace.Total revenues by deployment options were as follows:Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(in thousands, except percentage data)20222021$ Change% ChangeCloud$1,515,424 $967,832 $547,592 57 %Data Center560,319 336,273 224,046 67 Server525,028 607,778 (82,750)(14)Marketplace and services202,111 177,249 24,862 14 Total revenues$2,802,882 $2,089,132 $713,750 34 Total revenues by geography were as follows:Fiscal Year Ended June 30,(in thousands, except percentage data)20222021$ Change% ChangeAmericas$1,408,868 $1,028,481 $380,387 37 %EMEA1,077,338 826,445 250,893 30 Asia Pacific316,676 234,206 82,470 35 Total revenues$2,802,882 $2,089,132 $713,750 34 Cost of RevenuesFiscal Year Ended June 30,(in thousands, except percentage data)20222021$ Change% ChangeCost of revenues$452,914$331,850$121,064 36 %Gross margin84 %84 %Cost of revenues increased $121.1 million, or 36%, in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021.

Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to different tax rates in foreign jurisdictions such as Australia, and the recognition of significant permanent differences during fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Significant permanent differences included non-deductible charges related to the Notes, nondeductible stock-based compensation and research and development incentives. Our assessment of the recoverability of Australian and U.S. deferred tax assets will not change until there is sufficient evidence to support their realizability. Our assessment of the realizability of our Australian and U.S. deferred tax assets is based on all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, recent cumulative earnings or losses, expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, and the carry-forward periods available for the utilization of deferred tax assets.See Note 19, “Income Tax,” to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Changes in our global operations or local tax laws could result in changes to our effective tax rates, future cash flows and overall profitability of our operations.Liquidity and Capital Resources60As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2.1 billion, short-term investments totaling $10.0 million and trade receivables totaling $477.7 million. Since our inception, we have primarily financed our operations through cash flows generated by operations and corporate debt.Our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in thousands)202320222021Net cash provided by operating activities$868,111 $821,044 $789,960 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities(1,258)36,516 259,262 Net cash used in financing activities(148,421)(399,280)(1,603,433)Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(1,805)(9,233)5,408 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$716,627 $449,047 $(548,803)Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as expense associated with stock-based awards, impairment charges for leases and leasehold improvements, depreciation and amortization, gain on non-cash sale of controlling interest of a subsidiary and non-coupon impact related to the Notes and Capped Calls, the timing of employee-related costs such as bonus payments, collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows, income tax payment and changes in other working capital accounts.Accounts impacting working capital consist of accounts receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payables, current provisions, and current deferred revenue. Our working capital may be impacted by various factors in future periods, such as billings to customers for subscriptions, licenses and maintenance services and the subsequent collection of those billings or the amount and timing of certain expenditures.Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $47.1 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022. The net increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash received from customers, offset by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and cash used to pay income taxes.Net cash provided by investing activities decreased by $37.8 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022. The net decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $185.6 million from proceeds from sales of marketable securities and strategic investments, offset by a decrease of $92.2 million from purchases of strategic investments, a decrease of $44.9 million from purchases of property and equipment, and a decrease of $13.6 million from business combinations, net of cash acquired.Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $250.9 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022. The net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to repurchases of Class A Common Stock of $150.0 million during fiscal year 2023. The net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2022 was primarily attributable to the full settlement of the Notes for an aggregate consideration of $1.5 billion, offset by the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility of $1.0 billion and settlement of the Capped Call of $135.5 million.Material Cash RequirementsDebtIn October 2020, Atlassian US, Inc. entered into a credit agreement establishing a $1 billion senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facility”). We have fully drawn the Term Loan Facility, and we have full access to the $500 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Facility matures in October 2025 and as of July, 1 2023 and onward bears interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a margin up to 0.50% or Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus a spread of 0.875% to 1.50%, in each case with such margin being determined by our consolidated leverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed until its maturity, and we have the option to request an increase of $250 million in certain circumstances. The Credit Facility may be repaid at our discretion without penalty. Commencing on October 31, 2023, we are obligated to repay the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan in installments on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to 1.25% of the Term Loan Facility borrowing amount until the maturity of the Credit Facility. 61Share Repurchase ProgramIn January 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A Common Stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date, may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for approximately $154.2 million at an average price per share of $157.49. All repurchases were made in open market transactions. As of June 30, 2023, we were authorized to purchase the remaining $845.8 million of our Class A Common Stock under the Share Repurchase Program. Refer to Note 18, “Stockholder’s Equity,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of contractual commitments for cloud services platform and other infrastructure services, and obligations under leases for office space including obligations for leases that have not yet commenced. Refer to Note 11, “Leases,” Note 12, “Debt,” Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies,” and Note 18, “Stockholder’s Equity,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other Future ObligationsWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, and borrowing capacity from the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our other future cash requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spend on research and development efforts, employee headcount, marketing and sales activities, payments to tax authorities, acquisitions of additional businesses and technologies, the introduction of new software and services offerings, enhancements to our existing software and services offerings and the continued market acceptance of our products.As of June 30, 2023, the Company is not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we regularly review other measures that are not presented in accordance with GAAP, defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends, prepare financial forecasts and make strategic decisions. The key measures we consider are non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and free cash flow (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”). These Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance on a non-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges of a non-cash nature or that occur relatively infrequently and/or that management considers to be unrelated to our core operations. Management believes that tracking and presenting these Non-GAAP Financial Measures provides management, our board of directors, investors and the analyst community with the ability to better evaluate matters such as: our ongoing core operations, including comparisons between periods and against other companies in our industry; our ability to generate cash to service our debt and fund our operations; and the underlying business trends that are affecting our performance.Our Non-GAAP Financial Measures include: •Non-GAAP gross profit. Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges.•Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring charges.•Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring charges, non-coupon impact related to the Notes and Capped Calls, gain on a non-cash sale of a controlling interest of a subsidiary and the related income tax effects on these items, and a non-recurring income tax adjustment.•Free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which consists of purchases of property and equipment. 62We understand that although these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are frequently used by investors and the analyst community in their evaluation of our financial performance, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We compensate for such limitations by reconciling these Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.The following table presents a reconciliation of our Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except percentage and per share data):Fiscal Year Ended June 30,202320222021Gross profitGAAP gross profit$2,900,882 $2,349,968 $1,757,282 Plus: Stock-based compensation63,625 31,358 19,879 Plus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets22,853 22,694 22,394 Plus: Restructuring charges (1)9,192 — — Non-GAAP gross profit$2,996,552 $2,404,020 $1,799,555 Operating incomeGAAP operating income (loss)$(345,222)$70,083 $141,406 Plus: Stock-based compensation937,812 524,803 340,817 Plus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets33,127 32,398 31,754 Plus: Restructuring charges (1)96,894 — — Non-GAAP operating income$722,611 $627,284 $513,977 Operating marginGAAP operating margin(10)%3%7%Plus: Stock-based compensation26%18%16%Plus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets1%1%2%Plus: Restructuring charges (1)3%—%—%Non-GAAP operating margin20%22%25%Net incomeGAAP net loss$(486,761)$(519,510)$(578,979)Plus: Stock-based compensation937,812 524,803 340,817 Plus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets33,127 32,398 31,754 Plus: Restructuring charges (1)96,894 — — Plus: Non-coupon impact related to exchangeable senior notes and capped calls— 450,829 700,847 Less: Gain on a non-cash sale of a controlling interest of a subsidiary(45,158)— — Less: Income tax adjustments(43,659)(105,064)(95,021)Non-GAAP net income$492,255 $383,456 $399,418 Net income per shareGAAP net loss per share - diluted$(1.90)$(2.05)$(2.32)Plus: Stock-based compensation3.66 2.05 1.35 Plus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets0.13 0.13 0.13 Plus: Restructuring charges (1)0.38 — — Plus: Non-coupon impact related to exchangeable senior notes and capped calls— 1.78 2.80 Less: Gain on a non-cash sale of a controlling interest of a subsidiary(0.18)— — Less: Income tax adjustments(0.17)(0.41)(0.38)63Non-GAAP net income per share - diluted$1.92 $1.50 $1.58 Weighted-average diluted shares outstandingWeighted-average shares used in computing diluted GAAP net loss per share256,307 253,312 249,679 Plus: Dilution from dilutive securities (2)554 2,345 3,673 Weighted-average shares used in computing diluted non-GAAP net income per share256,861 255,657 253,352 Free cash flowGAAP net cash provided by operating activities$868,111 $821,044 $789,960 Less: Capital expenditures(25,652)(70,583)(31,520)Free cash flow$842,459 $750,461 $758,440 (1) Restructuring charges include stock-based compensation expense related to the rebalancing of resources for fiscal year 2023.(2) The effects of these dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted net loss per share for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe operate globally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies in the ordinary course of business. Our exposures primarily consist of the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Philippine peso, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty and New Zealand dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from commercial transactions and recognized financial assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Our financial risk management policy is reviewed annually by our Audit Committee and requires us to monitor our foreign exchange exposure on a regular basis.The substantial majority of our sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, and our operating expenses are generally denominated in the local currencies of the countries where our operations are located. We therefore benefit from a strengthening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by the weakening of the U.S. dollar. We have a cash flow hedging program in place and enter into derivative transactions to manage certain foreign currency exchange risks that arise in our ordinary business operations. We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.We enter into master netting agreements with select financial institutions to reduce our credit risk, and we trade with several counterparties to reduce our concentration risk with any single counterparty. We do not have significant exposure to counterparty credit risk at this time. We do not require nor are we required to post collateral of any kind related to our foreign currency derivatives.Foreign currency exchange rate exposureWe hedge material foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities using balance sheet hedges. The fluctuations in the fair market value of balance sheet hedges due to foreign currency rates generally offset those of the hedged items, resulting in no material effect on profit. Consequently, we are primarily exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with regard to the spot component of derivatives held within a designated cash flow hedge relationship affecting other comprehensive income.Foreign currency sensitivityA sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 indicated that a hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar applicable to our business would decrease or increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $52.2 million and $38.2 million, respectively.64Interest Rate RiskWe are exposed to interest rate risk arising from our variable interest rate Credit Facility. Our financial risk management policy is reviewed annually by our Audit Committee and requires us to monitor its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.We have a hedging program in place and enter into derivative transactions to manage the variable interest rate risks related to our Term Loan Facility. We enter into master netting agreements with financial institutions to execute our hedging program. Our master netting agreements are with select financial institutions to reduce our credit risk, and we trade with several counterparties to reduce our concentration risk with any single counterparty. We do not have significant exposure to counterparty credit risk at this time. We do not require nor are we required to post collateral of any kind related to our interest rate derivatives.We enter into interest rate swaps with the objective to hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate Term Loan Facility. The interest rate swaps involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and measured at fair value.A sensitivity analysis performed on interest rate swaps as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 indicated that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase the market value of our interest rate swap by $12.2 million and $17.6 million, respectively, and a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease the market value of our interest rate swap by $12.7 million and $18.8 million, respectively. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.In addition, our cash equivalents and investment portfolio are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2.1 billion and short-term investments totaling $10.0 million. A sensitivity analysis performed on our portfolio as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 indicated that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates did not have a material impact to market value of our investments. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.Equity Price RiskWe are also exposed to equity price risk in connection with our equity investments. Our publicly traded equity securities investments are susceptible to market price risk from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, our publicly traded equity securities investments were fair valued at $19.4 million and $30.8 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the respective share prices of our publicly traded equity securities investments as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 would increase or decrease the fair value by $1.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively.65",2023-12-30 21:42:34.187831
