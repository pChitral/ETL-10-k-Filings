31462,ECL,ECOLAB INC.,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding the operating results, cash flows and financial condition of Ecolab Inc. (“Ecolab”, “the company”, “we” or “our”). We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate level, and the quantitative impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). This discussion contains various “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and also contains various “Forward-Looking Statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. Comparability of Results Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates We evaluate the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures 2015 versus 2014 To provide a more meaningful period-over-period comparison, our 2015 versus 2014 acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of the divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude our Venezuelan results of operations from both 2015 and 2014. 2014 versus 2013 On April 10, 2013, we completed our acquisition of privately held Champion Technologies and its related company Corsicana Technologies (collectively “Champion”). The Champion business became part of our Global Energy reportable segment in the second quarter of 2013. The pro forma impact of the Champion acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements; therefore, pro forma information is not presented. Specific to the Champion transaction, due to the rapid pace at which the business has been integrated within our Global Energy segment, including all customer selling activity, discrete financial data specific to the legacy Champion business is no longer available for post-acquisition periods. As such, to allow for a more meaningful 2014 versus 2013 comparison, specific to the Champion transaction, Champion’s results for the period prior to acquisition in 2013 have been included for purposes of providing acquisition adjusted growth rates. All other acquisitions and divestitures continue to be handled consistent with the mechanics described in the 2015 versus 2014 discussion above. The 2014 versus 2013 acquisition adjusted growth rates do not exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from either 2014 or 2013. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2015, we delivered mid-single digit adjusted earnings per share growth in spite of declines in the energy and emerging markets and significant currency headwinds, including the devaluation of our Venezuelan Bolivares Fuertes (“bolivar”) businesses throughout 2015. Our Global Institutional, Global Industrial and Other segments delivered strong results, which more than offset weaker Global Energy results. We continued to drive positive adjusted fixed currency operating growth and margin trends through product cost savings, synergies and appropriate pricing. Through our focused actions, we once again delivered superior operating results for our shareholders in 2015 while continuing to build our future opportunities. Our performance underscored the strength and long-term potential of our business, our people and our strategies. 26 Table of Contents Sales Reported sales declined 5% to $13.5 billion in 2015 from $14.3 billion in 2014. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 1% compared to the prior year. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our Non-GAAP measures and the Net Sales table on page 32 and the Sales by Reportable Segment table on page 39 for reconciliation information. Gross Margin Our reported gross margin was 46.7% of sales for 2015, which compared to 2014 reported gross margin of 46.2%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2015 and 2014, our adjusted gross margin was 47.3% in 2015 and 46.3% in 2014. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our Non-GAAP measures and the Cost of Sales and Gross Margin table on page 33 for reconciliation information. Operating Income Reported operating income decreased 20% to $1.6 billion in 2015, compared to $2.0 billion in 2014. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, increased 1% in 2015. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 7%. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our Non-GAAP measures and the Operating Income table on page 37 and Operating Income by Reportable Segment table on page 39 for reconciliation information. Earnings Per Share Reported diluted earnings per share decreased 16% to $3.32 in 2015 compared to $3.93 in 2014. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years, driven primarily by Venezuelan related actions in 2015 and restructuring charges, acquisition and integration related costs, and other gains and charges in both 2015 and 2014. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items from both 2015 and 2014 increased 5% to $4.37 in 2015 compared to $4.18 in 2014. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our Non-GAAP measures, and the Diluted Earnings Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share table on page 38 for reconciliation information. Balance Sheet We remain committed to our stated objective of having an investment grade balance sheet, supported by our current credit ratings of BBB+/Baa1 by the major ratings agencies, and to achieving “A” range ratings metrics. We believe that our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates. Net Debt to EBITDA Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was 2.6 and 2.2 for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA, was 2.2 for both 2015 and 2014. We view these measures as an important indicator of our creditworthiness and demonstrates our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our Non-GAAP measures, and the Net Debt to EBITDA table on page 42 for reconciliation information. Cash Flow Cash flow from operating activities was $2.0 billion in 2015 compared to $1.8 billion in 2014. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. See the section entitled Cash Flows within this MD&A for further information. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in December 2015 to an indicated annual rate of $1.40 per share. The increase represents our 24th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 79th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead. Restructuring Initiatives Restructuring charges were substantially completed during 2015 under our two open restructuring plans, the Combined Plan and the Energy Restructuring Plan. The plans were commenced in 2011 and 2013, respectively, to reduce our global workforce, leverage and simplify our supply chain, reduce our distribution center locations and other facilities and strengthen our position in the global energy market. See the section entitled Restructuring Charges within this MD&A for further information. 27 Table of Contents Venezuela Activities As a result of the increasing currency controls, importation restrictions, workforce regulations, pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, and began accounting for the investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016. This action, coupled with the devaluations of our Venezuelan Water and Paper businesses during the second quarter of 2015 and our Venezuelan Food & Beverage and Institutional and bolivar portion of our Venezuelan Energy businesses during the third quarter of 2015, resulted in a total charge of $289.3 million ($246.8 million after tax), and $235.7 million net of the impact from noncontrolling interest, during 2015. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”). Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition or results of operations. Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists, title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on services as they are performed. While we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers’ needs are best met in a high quality way, the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales. Our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in Note 17. Our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. We also record estimated reserves for anticipated uncollectible accounts and for product returns and credits at the time of sale, as discussed below. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins at the time the incentive is offered. Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. In addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer balances based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. We estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $75 million and $77 million, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $15 million as of both December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.2% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. We believe that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. 28 Table of Contents Accrued Liabilities Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. As with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar services, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations. We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is probable. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see Note 15. Actuarially Determined Liabilities Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses. The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table. · The discount rate assumptions for the U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues rated Aa by Moody’s Investor Services or AA by Standard & Poors. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. This change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations or the funded status of our plans. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2015, our discount rate increased to 4.51% from 4.14% at year-end 2014. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2015, our discount rate increased to 4.38% from 4.08% at year-end 2014. · The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used for determining both the 2015 and 2016 U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.75%. · Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining both the 2015 and 2016 U.S. pension expenses was 4.32%. as of both December 31, 2015 and 2014. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2015, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 7.25%. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2027 and remain at those levels thereafter. · In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2015, we utilized the RP-2014 mortality table adjusting back to 2006 using MP-2014, and then projected forward using projection scale MP-2015. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans decreased to $513 million as of December 31, 2015 from $556 million as of December 31, 2014 (both before tax), primarily due to amortization of prior year net actuarial losses. 29 Table of Contents The effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2015, on the December 31, 2015 funded status and 2016 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans: Effect on U.S. Pension Plans Increase in Higher Assumption Recorded 2016 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $67.6 $6.4 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A 4.4 Effect on U.S. Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans Increase in Higher Assumption Recorded 2016 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $7.0 $0.5 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A 0.0 Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations. However, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information. See Note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations. Self Insurance Globally we have high deductible insurance policies for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. A change in these actuarial assumptions would have an immaterial impact to our reported results. Restructuring Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. These restructuring plans include costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets. Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During 2015, we incurred approximately $100 million under our two active plans (Combined and Energy). Restructuring charges were substantially completed within both plans during the fourth quarter of 2015. Our restructuring liability balance was $90 million and $76 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional information on our current restructuring activities, see Note 3. Income Taxes Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. 30 Table of Contents Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. During interim periods, this expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. In the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period. Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return, but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements. U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings. It is impractical to determine the amount of incremental taxes on an ongoing basis that might arise if all undistributed earnings were distributed. Uncertain Tax Positions A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns (Ecolab and Nalco) through 2012. To date, the 2012 U.S. income tax return of Champion has not been audited. Our Ecolab U.S. federal (including Nalco and Champion) income tax returns for the years 2013 and 2014 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. The majority of our tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $75 million and $79 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 12. Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill Long-Lived and Intangible Assets We periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. During 2015, as part of the actions taken regarding our Venezuelan businesses, we wrote-off customer relationship intangible assets and other long-lived assets. See Note 3 for additional information regarding Venezuela. Also during 2015, we impaired certain long-lived assets related to a product line within one of our U.S. plants. See Note 3 for additional information regarding this asset impairment. 31 Table of Contents We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships. Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer base acquired in our recent Nalco and Champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. Our customer retention rate and history of maintaining long-term relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future. Additionally, other less certain post-acquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions, induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships. If our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets. In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets. As part of the Nalco merger, we added the “Nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using the qualitative assessment method, during the second quarter of 2015. Based on this testing, no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2015 indicated a need to update to our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2015. Goodwill We had total goodwill of $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the operating unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our operating units are aligned with our ten operating segments. For our 2015 impairment assessment, in order to refresh the estimated fair value of all ten of our operating units, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative test. The two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each operating unit to the operating unit’s carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of an operating unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the operating unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the operating unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. Our goodwill impairment assessment for 2015 indicated the fair value of each of our operating units exceeded their respective carrying amount by a significant margin. If circumstances change significantly, we would also test an operating unit’s goodwill for impairment during interim periods between our annual tests. As a result of the Venezuela deconsolidation, we updated our goodwill impairment assessment for the Global Energy reportable segment during the fourth quarter of 2015, which indicated no impairment, and a continued significant margin of fair value exceeding carrying value. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Percent Change (millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Reported GAAP net sales $13,545.1 $14,280.5 $13,253.4 (5) % 8 % Effect of foreign currency translation 305.0 (623.3) (756.8) Non-GAAP fixed currency sales $13,850.1 $13,657.2 $12,496.6 1 % 9 % Reported net sales for 2015 decreased 5%, negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation. Fixed currency sales increased 1% in 2015. Reported net sales for 2014 increased 8%, with growth benefiting from the Champion acquisition. Foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales growth in 2014 as fixed currency sales increased 9%. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5% in 2014. 32 Table of Contents The percentage change components of the year-over-year sales increase are as follows: (percent) 2015 2014 Volume 0 % 4 % Price changes 0 1 Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increase 0 5 Acquisitions & divestitures 1 4 Fixed currency sales increase 1 9 Foreign currency translation (7) (1) Reported GAAP net sales increase (decrease) (5) % 8 % Note: Amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding. Cost of Sales (“COS”) and Gross Margin 2015 2014 2013 Gross Gross Gross (millions/percent) COS Margin COS Margin COS Margin Reported GAAP COS and gross margin $7,223.5 46.7 % $7,679.1 46.2 % $7,161.2 46.0 % Special (gains) and charges 80.6 0.6 14.3 0.1 43.2 0.3 Non-GAAP adjusted COS and gross margin $7,142.9 47.3 % $7,664.8 46.3 % $7,118.0 46.3 % Our COS values and corresponding gross profit margin (“gross margin”) are shown in the previous table. Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales. Our reported gross margin was 46.7%, 46.2% and 46.0% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our 2015, 2014 and 2013 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $80.6 million, $14.3 million and $43.2 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the special (gains) and charges table on page 34. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2015 adjusted gross margin was 47.3% compared against a 2014 adjusted gross margin of 46.3%. The increase was due primarily to delivered product cost savings and synergies. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 46.3% for both 2014 and 2013. The adjusted gross margin across 2014 and 2013 was impacted by the growth within Global Energy, including the impact of the Champion acquisition, which generally has a lower gross margin compared to our other segments, which offset pricing gains. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”) (percent) 2015 2014 2013 SG&A Ratio 32.1 % 32.1 % 32.9 % The consistent SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2015 against 2014 resulted from the impact of net synergies and cost savings actions which were offset by investments in the business. The reduction in SG&A ratio when comparing 2014 against 2013 resulted from increased sales leverage, net synergies and cost savings actions. 33 Table of Contents Special (Gains) and Charges Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income included the following items: (millions) 2015 2014 2013 Cost of sales Restructuring charges $16.5 $13.9 $6.6 Venezuela related charges 33.3 - - Inventory costs (14.5) - - Inventory reserves 20.6 - - Fixed asset impairment 24.7 - - Recognition of inventory fair value step-up - 0.4 36.6 Subtotal 80.6 14.3 43.2 Special (gains) and charges Restructuring charges 83.8 69.2 83.4 Champion acquisition and integration costs 17.1 19.9 49.7 Nalco merger and integration costs 1.6 8.5 18.6 Venezuela related charges 256.0 - 23.2 (Gains) losses related to litigation activities, sale of businesses, settlements and other 56.3 (28.8) (3.6) Subtotal 414.8 68.8 171.3 Operating income subtotal 495.4 83.1 214.5 Interest expense, net Acquisition debt costs - - 2.5 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest Restructuring charges (1.7) - - Venezuela related charges (11.1) - (0.5) Subtotal (12.8) - (0.5) Total special (gains) and charges $482.6 $83.1 $216.5 For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges have been included in our corporate segment, which is consistent with our internal management reporting. Restructuring Charges Energy Restructuring Plan In April 2013, following the completion of the acquisition of Champion we commenced plans to undertake restructuring and other cost-saving actions to realize our acquisition-related cost synergies as well as streamline and strengthen our position in the global energy market (the “Energy Restructuring Plan”). Actions associated with the acquisition to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the business included a reduction of the combined business’s current global workforce. Actions also included leveraging and simplifying our global supply chain, including the reduction of plant, distribution center and redundant facility locations and product line optimization. Restructuring charges within the Energy Restructuring Plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Certain immaterial actions may continue into 2016. Ongoing cash payments will continue into 2016. Cumulative restructuring charges of $82 million ($59 million after tax), are materially consistent with our expectation of $80 million ($55 million after tax). We recorded restructuring charges of $47.2 million ($33.0 million after tax), $31.3 million net of the impact from noncontrolling interest, or $0.10 per diluted share, $9.5 million ($6.4 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and $27.4 million ($19.4 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As a result of the ownership structure of certain entities holding Energy Restructuring charges, we reflected $1.7 million of the 2015 charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Net cash payments under the Energy Restructuring Plan were $11.1 million during 2015 and $31.4 million from 2013 through 2014. The majority of cash payments under this plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. We anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will be funded from operating activities. During 2015 the Energy Restructuring Plan achieved approximately $45 million of incremental savings as compared to 2014. Cumulative cost savings from this plan, along with synergies achieved in connection with the acquisition, were $125 million in 2015. We anticipate annualized cumulative cost savings and synergies of $150 million by the end of 2016. 34 Table of Contents Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3. Combined Restructuring Plan In February 2011, we commenced a comprehensive plan to substantially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our European business, as well as to undertake certain restructuring activities outside of Europe, historically referred to as the “2011 Restructuring Plan”. Additionally, in January 2012 and following the merger with Nalco, we formally commenced plans to undertake restructuring actions related to the reduction of our global workforce and optimization of our supply chain and office facilities, including planned reduction of plant and distribution center locations, historically referred to as the “Merger Restructuring Plan”. During the first quarter of 2013, we determined that because the objectives of the plans discussed above were aligned, the previously separate restructuring plans should be combined into one plan. The combined restructuring plan (the “Combined Plan”) combines opportunities and initiatives from both plans and continues to follow the original format of the Merger Restructuring Plan by focusing on global actions related to optimization of the supply chain and office facilities, including reductions of the global workforce, plant and distribution center locations. Restructuring charges within the Combined Plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Certain immaterial actions may continue into 2016. Ongoing cash payments will continue into 2016. Cumulative restructuring charges of $404 million ($310 million after tax), are materially consistent with our expectation of $400 million ($300 million after tax). We recorded restructuring charges of $53.0 million ($44.2 million after tax) or $0.15 per diluted share, $73.5 million ($58.5 million after tax) or $0.19 per diluted share and $63.6 million ($48.3 million after tax) or $0.16 per diluted share during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net cash payments under the Combined Plan were $42.1 million during 2015 and $261.0 million from 2011 through 2014. The majority of cash payments under the Combined Plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. We anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will continue to be funded from operating activities. During 2015, the Combined Plan achieved approximately $60 million of incremental savings as compared to 2014. Cumulative cost savings from this plan, along with annual cost saving and synergies, were $395 million in 2015. We anticipate annualized cumulative cost savings and synergies of $420 million by the end of 2016. Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3. Non-Restructuring Special (Gains) and Charges Champion acquisition and integration costs As a result of the Champion acquisition completed in 2013, we incurred charges of $17.1 million ($10.7 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share, $19.9 million ($12.8 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share and $88.8 million ($61.4 million) or $0.20 per diluted share, during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Champion acquisition and integration related costs have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts within cost of sales include the recognition of fair value step-up in Champion international inventory, which is maintained on a FIFO basis, and Champion U.S. inventory which was associated with the adoption of LIFO and integration into an existing LIFO pool. Amounts within special (gains) and charges include acquisition costs and integration charges. Amounts within net interest expense include the interest expense through the April 2013 close date of the Champion transaction of our $500 million public debt issuance in December 2012 as well as amortizable fees to secure term loans and short-term debt, all of which were initiated to fund the Champion acquisition. Nalco merger and integration costs As a result of the Nalco merger completed in 2011, we incurred charges of $1.6 million ($1.3 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share, $8.5 million ($7.0 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share and $18.6 million ($14.2 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Nalco merger and integration charges have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts within special (gains) and charges include merger and integration charges. 35 Table of Contents Venezuela As of the end of 2015, the increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to dollars through official currency exchange markets have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and the U.S. dollar. This has significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our Venezuelan businesses, including restrictions on the ability of our Venezuelan businesses to settle U.S. dollar-denominated obligations. The currency controls, coupled with importation restrictions, workforce regulations, pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements have significantly influenced our ability to make and execute operational decisions regarding our businesses in Venezuela. The inability of our Venezuelan businesses to pay dividends, which remain subject to Venezuelan government approvals, has continued to restrict our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our Venezuelan businesses. We expect the conditions described above will continue for the foreseeable future. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2015, given our high level of intercompany receivables, we pursued cash basis transactions to limit additional investment. As a result of these factors, we concluded that effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we do not meet the U.S. GAAP accounting criteria for control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, and began accounting for the investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016. This action resulted in a charge of $123.4 million ($80.9 million after tax) or $0.27 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2015, to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The fourth quarter 2015 charge included $85 million of intercompany receivables, as well as net assets of our Venezuelan businesses and accumulated foreign currency. The decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiaries was preceded by the remeasurement of our Venezuelan Water and Paper net assets during the second quarter of 2015 at the Marginal Currency System (“SIMADI”) exchange rate and the remeasurement of our Venezuelan Food & Beverage and Institutional net assets and bolivar portion of our Venezuelan Energy net assets at the SIMADI exchange rate during the third quarter of 2015. The combination of these actions resulted in charges of $165.9 million ($165.9 million after tax) through the first three quarters of 2015. As a result of the ownership structure of our Food & Beverage and Institutional operations in Venezuela, we reflected $11.1 million of the above charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income, resulting in a net charge of $154.8 million. The total charges during 2015 related to our actions in Venezuela were $289.3 million ($246.8 million after tax), $235.7 million net of the impact from noncontrolling interest, or $0.78 per share. On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency from 4.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to 6.3 bolivars to 1 U.S. dollar, resulting in a charge during 2013 of $22.7 million ($16.1 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, due to the remeasurement of the local balance sheet. Other special (gains) and charges During 2015, we recorded a charge of $24.7 million ($15.4 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, related to a fixed asset impairment, consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our U.S. plants, resulting from lower than anticipated production. Also during 2015, we improved estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing, resulting in a net pre-tax charge of approximately $6 million. Separately, the actions resulted in a charge of $20.6 million ($15.9 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, related to inventory reserve calculations, partially offset by a gain of $14.5 million ($12.2 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory. These items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Also during 2015, we recognized a net charge of $56.3 million ($34.5 million after tax), or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily made up of litigation related charges and the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our Ecovation business, offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the Champion transaction. The net charges have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2014, we recorded a special gain of $28.4 million ($23.3 million after tax), or $0.08 per diluted share, as a result of a favorable licensing settlement and other settlement gains, the consolidation of the Emirates National Chemicals Company LLC (“Emochem”) entity and removal of the corresponding equity method investment and the disposition of a business. The net charges have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further details related to our non-restructuring special (gains) and charges are included in Note 3. 36 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Income Margin Percent Change (millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Reported GAAP operating income $ 1,561.3 $ 1,955.0 $ 1,560.6 (20) % 25 % Special (gains) and charges 495.4 83.1 214.5 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income 2,056.7 2,038.1 1,775.1 1 15 Effect of foreign currency translation 44.0 (82.0) (98.0) Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income $ 2,100.7 $ 1,956.1 $ 1,677.1 7 % 17 % (percent) 2015 2014 2013 Reported GAAP operating income margin 11.5 % 13.7 % 11.8 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin 15.2 % 14.3 % 13.4 % Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 15.2 % 14.3 % 13.4 % Reported operating income decreased 20% when comparing 2015 to 2014 and increased 25% when comparing 2014 to 2013. Our reported operating income for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2015 adjusted operating income increased 1% when compared to 2014 adjusted operating income and 2014 adjusted operating income increased 15% when compared to 2013 adjusted operating income. As shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted operating income growth for both 2015 and 2014, as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 7% for 2015 and 17% for 2014. The 2015 adjusted fixed currency operating income increase and the improving adjusted fixed currency operating margin trend was driven by delivered product cost savings and synergies, which more than offset investment in the business and other costs. The 2014 adjusted fixed currency operating income increase and the improving adjusted fixed currency operating margin trend was driven by sales volume increases, pricing gains, net cost savings and synergies. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately 2 percentage points to our 2014 adjusted fixed currency operating income growth rate. Interest Expense, Net Percent Change (millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Reported GAAP interest expense, net $243.6 $256.6 $262.3 (5) % (2) % Special (gains) and charges - - 2.5 Non-GAAP adjusted interest expense, net $243.6 $256.6 $259.8 (5) % (1) % Reported net interest expense totaled $243.6 million, $256.6 million and $262.3 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Special (gains) and charges reported within net interest expense in 2013 included the interest expense of our $500 million public debt issuance in December 2012 through the April 2013 close date of the Champion acquisition, as well as amortizable fees to secure term loans and short-term debt, all of which were initiated to fund the Champion acquisition. The decrease in 2015 net interest expense compared to 2014 net interest expense was driven primarily by lower interest rates paid on outstanding debt. The decrease in 2014 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2013 adjusted net interest expense was due primarily to lower comparable outstanding debt, offset partially by increased net expense related to our foreign currency hedging program and other interest-related fees. Provision for Income Taxes The following table provides a summary of our tax rate: (percent) 2015 2014 2013 Reported GAAP tax rate 22.8 % 28.0 % 25.0 % Tax rate impact of: Special gains and charges (0.4) (0.1) 0.4 Discrete tax items 3.5 (0.7) 2.7 Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 25.9 % 27.2 % 28.1 % Our reported tax rate for 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items. Depending on the nature of our special gains and charges and discrete tax items, our reported tax rate may not be consistent on a period to period basis, as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our overall non-GAAP adjusted tax rate. 37 Table of Contents Our 2015 reported tax rate includes $105.7 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of $63.3 million associated with discrete tax items. Our 2014 reported tax rate includes $21.6 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expense of $13.2 million associated with discrete tax items. Our 2013 reported tax rate includes $60.1 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of $41.7 million associated with discrete tax items. The corresponding impact of these items on the reported tax rate is shown in the table above. Net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of $20.6 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of $39.0 million for the tax basis in a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary. Net expense related to discrete tax items in 2014 was driven primarily by an update to non-current tax liabilities for certain global tax audits, an adjustment related to the re-characterization of intercompany payments between our U.S. and foreign affiliates, the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in our deferred state tax rate, recognizing adjustments from filing our 2013 U.S. federal and state tax returns, net changes of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and the impact from other foreign country audit settlements. Net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2013 were driven primarily by the net release of valuation allowances related to the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets of $11.5 million, the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities of $11.3 million and recognizing adjustments from filing our 2012 U.S. federal and state tax returns of $11.0 million. The remaining net discrete tax items relate primarily to recognizing settlements related to prior year income tax audits, law changes within a foreign jurisdiction, the retroactive extension during first quarter 2013 of the U.S. R&D credit for 2012, foreign audit adjustments and other adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities. The decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate from 2013 to 2015 was impacted by global tax planning projects. The decrease in our 2014 adjusted effective tax rate compared to 2013 was also impacted by favorable geographic income mix. Net Income Attributable to Ecolab Percent Change (millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Reported GAAP net income $1,002.1 $1,202.8 $967.8 (17) % 24 % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges, after tax 376.9 61.5 156.4 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) (63.3) 13.2 (41.7) Non-GAAP adjusted net income $1,315.7 $1,277.5 $1,082.5 3 % 18 % Diluted Earnings Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (EPS) Percent Change (dollars) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Reported GAAP diluted EPS $3.32 $3.93 $3.16 (16) % 24 % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges 1.25 0.20 0.51 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) (0.21) 0.04 (0.14) Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS $4.37 $4.18 $3.54 5 % 18 % Note: Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding. Reported net income attributable to Ecolab totaled $1,002.1 million, $1,202.8 million and $967.8 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which resulted in reported diluted earnings per share of $3.32, $3.93 and $3.16 for the corresponding periods. Amounts for 2015, 2014 and 2013 include special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items. Excluding special (gains) and charges and the impact of discrete tax items from 2015, 2014 and 2013, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3% and 5%, respectively, when comparing 2015 to 2014 and both increased 18%, when comparing 2014 to 2013. Currency translation has had significant unfavorable impact on reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share comparability across 2013 to 2015, with headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share for 2015 compared to 2014 and approximately $0.07 per share for 2014 compared to 2013. 38 Table of Contents SEGMENT PERFORMANCE The non-U.S. dollar functional international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates used by management for 2015. The difference between the fixed currency exchange rates and the actual currency exchange rates is reported as “effect of foreign currency translation” in the following tables. All other accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with U.S. GAAP and the accounting policies described in Note 2. Additional information about our reportable segments is included in Note 17. Fixed currency net sales and operating income for 2015, 2014 and 2013 for our reportable segments are shown in the following tables.

At a regional level, the 2015 sales increase was impacted by strong growth in Latin America and Middle East/Africa (“MEA”), moderate growth in Europe and modest gains in North America. Regional results for 2014 were impacted by strong growth in Latin America, with moderate growth in MEA and modest gains in Asia Pacific and North America. 39 Table of Contents At an operating unit level, Water fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2015 (increase of 3% acquisition adjusted), with good growth in the light and heavy industries, which offset slower sales in the mining industry. Fixed currency sales increased 5% in 2014, (increase of 4% acquisition adjusted) led by gains in heavy, light and mining. Food & Beverage fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2015 (increase of 5% acquisition adjusted), benefiting from share gains. Growth was led by the beverage and brewing market, with modest gains in the dairy and food markets. Fixed currency sales increased 4% in 2014, (increase of 3% acquisition adjusted) driven by gains in agri, dairy and beverage and brewing. Paper fixed currency sales increased 1% in 2015 (increase of 2% acquisition adjusted), impacted by new account gains and continued technology penetration. Fixed currency sales were flat in 2014 (decrease of 2% acquisition adjusted) with unfavorable volume impact from below capacity plant utilization at customer locations and customer plant closures. Textile Care fixed currency sales increased 5% in 2015, impacted by new accounts and customer penetration within North America and Europe. Fixed currency sales decreased 1% in 2014, impacted by lower comparable sales in Europe. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income growth in 2015 and the corresponding operating margin increase benefited from delivered product cost savings, synergies and pricing gains, which more than offset investments in the business. Fixed currency operating income growth in 2014 and the corresponding operating margin increase benefited from pricing gains, sales volume increases and net cost savings. Global Institutional 2015 2014 2013 Net Sales Sales at fixed currency (millions) $4,393.2 $4,157.9 $3,998.0 Percentage change at fixed currency 6 % 4 % Acquisition adjusted percentage change at fixed currency 5 % 4 % Percentage change at public currency 0 % 3 % Operating Income Operating income at fixed currency (millions) $900.7 $800.8 $753.5 Percentage change at fixed currency 12 % 6 % Acquisition adjusted percentage change at fixed currency 13 % 7 % Percentage change at public currency 8 % 6 % Operating income margin at fixed currency 20.5 % 19.3 % 18.8 % Net Sales Fixed currency sales growth for our Global Institutional segment in both 2015 and 2014 benefited from volume increases and pricing gains. At a regional level, the 2015 sales increase was led by strong growth in Asia Pacific and MEA, good growth in North America and Latin America, and modest gains in Europe. The 2014 sales increase was led by strong growth in Latin America, and good gains in Asia Pacific and North America, which collectively offset slower sales in Europe. At an operating unit level, Institutional fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2015, as sales initiatives, new accounts and globalization of our leading technologies continued to drive growth. Global lodging experienced moderate growth, while foodservice trends remained soft. Fixed currency sales increased 4% in 2014, benefiting from new accounts, sales initiatives and effective product programs. Specialty fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2015. Quick service sales remained solid, benefiting from new accounts and new product penetration; our food retail business showed good sales growth. Fixed currency sales increased 8% in 2014, driven by solid results from both of our quick service and food retail businesses. Healthcare fixed currency sales increased 2% in 2015, benefiting from new account growth, customer penetration and product introductions. Fixed currency sales increased 1% in 2014, driven by new account growth and product introductions. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income growth in 2015 and the corresponding operating margin increase benefited from pricing gains, sales volume increases and delivered product cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business. Fixed currency operating income growth in 2014 and the corresponding operating margin increase benefited from the net impact of pricing gains, sales volume increases and net cost savings. 40 Table of Contents Global Energy 2015 2014 2013 Net Sales Sales at fixed currency (millions) $3,825.7 $4,145.0 $3,320.1 Percentage change at fixed currency (8) % 25 % Acquisition adjusted percentage change at fixed currency (9) % 10 % Percentage change at public currency (13) % 23 % Operating Income Operating income at fixed currency (millions) $550.7 $612.5 $435.0 Percentage change at fixed currency (10) % 41 % Acquisition adjusted percentage change at fixed currency (13) % 33 % Percentage change at public currency (16) % 35 % Operating income margin at fixed currency 14.4 % 14.8 % 13.1 % Net Sales Lower 2015 fixed currency sales for our Global Energy segment were negatively impacted by volume reductions and lower pricing. The decrease in 2015 fixed currency sales primarily reflected significant reductions in our well stimulation business and slightly lower sales in our production business; these more than offset growth in our downstream business. Continued growth in our international regions was offset by soft North America results, reflecting the reduction in North America drilling and well completion activity, customer spending and price reductions. Fixed currency sales growth in 2014 was impacted by the Champion acquisition. The acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increase reflected double-digit growth in our upstream business, led by strong international performance and good growth in North America. Deepwater and on-shore conventional sources produced solid results. Sales growth in our downstream business resulted from improved international performance and market share gains in North America. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income reductions in 2015 and the corresponding operating margin slippage were driven by sales volume declines and lower pricing, which more than offset delivered product cost savings and synergies. Fixed currency operating income growth in 2014 was impacted by the Champion acquisition. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income and the corresponding operating income margin increase were largely driven by sales volume increases and business mix changes, with the corresponding benefit to operating income. The remainder of the increase can largely be attributed to the net impact of pricing gains, synergies, investments in the business and other costs. Other 2015 2014 2013 Net Sales Sales at fixed currency (millions) $773.4 $731.1 $691.2 Percentage change at fixed currency 6 % 6 % Acquisition adjusted percentage change at fixed currency 6 % 5 % Percentage change at public currency 2 % 6 % Operating Income Operating income at fixed currency (millions) $132.0 $113.4 $102.8 Percentage change at fixed currency 16 % 10 % Acquisition adjusted percentage change at fixed currency 17 % 11 % Percentage change at public currency 12 % 12 % Operating income margin at fixed currency 17.1 % 15.5 % 14.9 % Net Sales Fixed currency sales growth for our Other segment in both 2015 and 2014 was driven by volume increases and pricing gains. At a regional level, the 2015 sales increase was led by good growth in Latin America, North America and Asia Pacific, with moderate gains in Europe. The 2014 sales increase was led by strong growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. North America had good sales gains. 41 Table of Contents At an operating unit level, Pest Elimination fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2015, impacted by continued gains in the foodservice market, benefiting from customer penetration and new service offerings. Fixed currency sales increased 5% in 2014 benefiting from gains in the food and beverage and foodservice markets. Equipment Care fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2015, driven by increases in both service and parts sales, benefiting from new customer additions. Fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2014, with service and installed parts sales increases benefiting the growth. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income growth in both 2015 and 2014, and the corresponding operating margin increases, benefited from pricing gains and sales volume increases, which more than offset other cost increases. Corporate Consistent with our internal management reporting, the Corporate segment includes intangible asset amortization specifically from the Nalco merger and in 2013 certain integration costs for both the Nalco and Champion transactions. The Corporate segment also includes special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Items included within special (gains) and charges are shown in the table on page 34. FINANCIAL POSITION & LIQUIDITY Financial Position Total assets were $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2015, compared to total assets of $19.4 billion as of December 31, 2014. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the value of our foreign assets translated into U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2015 and the impact of intangible asset amortization more than offset the increase in assets from acquisitions and ongoing business activities. Total liabilities were $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2015, compared to total liabilities of $12.0 billion as of December 31, 2014. Total debt was $6.5 billion as of both December 31, 2015 and 2014. See further discussion of our debt activity within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A. Our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBIDTA are shown in the following table. We view our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios as important indicators of our creditworthiness. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. As shown below, EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA. 2015 2014 2013 (ratio) Net debt to EBITDA 2.6 2.2 2.8 Net debt to adjusted EBITDA 2.2 2.2 2.5 (millions) Net Debt Total debt $6,465.5 $6,548.2 $6,875.8 Cash 92.8 209.6 339.2 Net debt $6,372.7 $6,338.6 $6,536.6 EBITDA Net income including non-controlling interest $1,017.2 $1,222.2 $973.6 Provision for income taxes 300.5 476.2 324.7 Interest expense, net 243.6 256.6 262.3 Depreciation 559.5 558.1 514.2 Amortization 300.0 313.9 302.0 EBITDA 2,420.8 2,827.0 2,376.8 Special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA 495.4 83.1 214.5 Adjusted EBITDA $2,916.2 $2,910.1 $2,591.3 42 Table of Contents Cash Flows Operating Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Cash provided by operating activities $1,999.8 $1,815.6 $1,559.8 $184.2 $255.8 We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business, debt repayments and pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2013 to 2015 was impacted by various factors, including the following: · Increased income, adjusted for the non-cash impact of the Venezuela charges, the fixed asset impairment and other charges. · Fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable (“working capital”), the combination of which increased $119 million, $212 million and $127 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The cash flow impact across the three years from accounts receivable was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections. The cash flow impact across the three years from inventories was impacted by timing of purchases and production and usage levels, and from accounts payable was impacted by volume of purchases and timing of payments. · Payment of certain non-recurring items in 2013 related to liabilities assumed with the Champion acquisition. Pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest are shown in the following table. Dollar Change (millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Pensions and postretirement plan contributions $64.9 $76.7 $80.0 $(11.8) $(3.3) Restructuring payments 53.2 82.7 120.6 (29.5) (37.9) Income tax payments 533.1 522.0 434.2 11.1 87.8 Interest payments 237.2 255.5 258.9 (18.3) (3.4) Investing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Cash used for investing activities $(915.8) $(848.3) $(2,087.7) $(67.5) $1,239.4 Cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business. Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $265 million, $72 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. The Champion acquisition accounted for $1.3 billion of the net cash paid for acquisitions in 2013. Our acquisitions and divestitures across 2015, 2014 and 2013 are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth. We continue to make capital investments in the business, including process control and monitoring equipment, equipment used by our customers to dispense our products and manufacturing facilities. Total capital expenditures, including software, were $815 million, $794 million and $662 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Investing related cash flows in 2015 were also impacted by settlement of a net investment hedge and receipt of Champion related escrow funds. Financing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Cash used for financing activities $(1,150.9) $(1,071.0) $(292.6) $(79.9) $(778.4) 43 Table of Contents Our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent consideration. Our 2015 debt financing activities included the issuance of $300 million 1.55%, $300 million 2.25% and €575 million 2.63% fixed rate senior notes; the scheduled repayment of our $250 million 4.88% and $500 million 1.00% senior notes; and repayment of $275 million of term loan borrowings. Net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of $312 million during 2015. Our 2014 debt financing activities included the repayment of $400 million of term loan borrowings, over the course of 2014, and the scheduled repayment of our $500 million 2.38% senior notes. Net borrowings of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net cash inflow of $600 million during 2014. Our 2013 debt financing activities included $900 million of term loan borrowings initiated in connection with the Champion transaction, the scheduled repayment of our €125 million Series A notes ($170 million) in December 2013, the redemption of debt acquired through the Champion transaction and repayment of $100 million of term loan borrowings. Net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net cash outflow of $278 million during 2013. Shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. In February 2015, we announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, of which $382 million remains to be repurchased as of December 31, 2015. We expect the program to be completed by mid-2016. During 2015, we repurchased a total of $755 million of shares, which includes $300 million of shares through the ASR program discussed further in Note 10. During 2014 and 2013, we repurchased $429 million and $308 million of shares, respectively. Cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity. In December 2015, we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 6%. This represents the 24th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. We have paid dividends on our common stock for 79 consecutive years. Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year 2015 $0.330 $0.330 $0.330 $0.350 $1.340 2014 0.275 0.275 0.275 0.330 1.155 2013 0.230 0.230 0.230 0.275 0.965 Comparability of dividends paid across 2013 to 2015 was impacted by the dividend rate increase noted in the above table, as well as the payment timing of dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012. Financing activities for 2014 also included an acquisition-related contingent consideration payment of $86 million made to Champion’s former shareholders. Liquidity and Capital Resources We currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2016, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension contributions, with cash from operating activities, cash reserves available in certain foreign jurisdictions and additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong. As of December 31, 2015, we had $92.8 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $88.3 million was held outside of the U.S. We have recorded deferred tax liabilities of $25.8 million and $37.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for pre-acquisition foreign earnings associated with the Nalco merger and Champion acquisition that we intend to repatriate. These liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction. We consider the remaining portion of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and we have no intention to repatriate such funds. We continue to be focused on building our global business and these funds are available for use by our international operations. To the extent the remaining portion of the foreign earnings would be repatriated, such amounts would be subject to income tax or foreign withholding tax liabilities that may be fully or partially offset by foreign tax credits, both in the U.S. and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2015 we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in December 2019. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The credit facility supports our $2.0 billion U.S. commercial paper program and $200 million European commercial paper program. Combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2015, we had $605 million in outstanding U.S. commercial paper, with an average annual interest rate of 0.7%, and no amounts outstanding under our European commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2015, both programs were rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s. 44 Table of Contents Additionally, we have other committed and uncommitted credit lines of $766 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs, including with respect to bank supported letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees. Approximately $570 million of these credit lines was unutilized and available for use as of year-end 2015. Our long-term debt issuance and repayment activity is discussed in the Cash Flow - Financing Activities section of this MD&A. As of December 31, 2015, our short-term borrowing program was rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s. As of December 31, 2015, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at BBB+ (positive outlook) and Baa1 (stable outlook), respectively. A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs, or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. Should this occur, we could seek additional sources of funding, including issuing additional term notes or bonds. In addition, we have the ability, at our option, to draw upon our $2.0 billion of committed credit facility prior to termination. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures. A schedule of our obligations as of December 31, 2015 under various notes payable, long-term debt agreements, operating leases with noncancelable terms in excess of one year and interest obligations are summarized in the following table: Payments Due by Period Less More Than 2-3 4-5 Than (millions) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Notes payable $ 31 $ 31 $ - $ - $ - Commercial paper 605 605 - - - Long-term debt 5,824 1,568 1,067 321 2,868 Capital lease obligations 6 1 1 1 3 Operating leases 434 102 150 102 80 Interest* 1,800 199 297 262 1,042 Total $ 8,700 $ 2,506 $ 1,515 $ 686 $ 3,993 *Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year-end 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $85 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2016 based on plan asset values as of December 31, 2015. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $42 million in 2016. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles. Except for the approximately $196 million utilized under the bank lines noted previously supporting domestic and international commercial relationships and transactions, we do not have significant unconditional purchase obligations or significant other commercial commitments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. See Note 13 for information on our operating leases. Through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary. The joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. These entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 45 Table of Contents Market Risk We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had €175 million and €575 million senior notes and a €25 million forward contract designated as net investment hedges. We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2015, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $1,675 million. See Note 8 for further information on our hedging activity. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items. GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT Oil Markets and Global Energy Investments During 2015, approximately 28% of our sales were generated from our Global Energy segment, the results of which, as noted further below, are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets. Energy Markets Oil prices remained sharply lower in 2015 when compared to 2014, with continued supply pressures negatively impacting exploration and production investments, particularly in North America. Additionally, we experienced pricing headwinds in 2015 when compared to 2014. Demand for oil and overall energy consumption has remained consistent. Lower oil prices slowed our 2015 Global Energy segment results. Our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the Global Energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. As such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment. As petroleum derived materials are key inputs to many of our chemical products, lower oil prices will continue to provide benefits across our segments in the form of lower raw material costs. Energy Investments We have a joint venture in Kazakhstan, which we acquired as part of the Champion transaction that holds a contract to supply production chemicals for use in the Kashagan oil project, a Caspian Sea shallow water oil field. The startup of production at the Kashagan project has been significantly delayed and output was indefinitely halted after pipeline failures were discovered in October 2013. We anticipate that the pipelines will be repaired and production restarted; however, if this does not occur, or does not occur in a timely manner, we believe the impact of such events would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Our remaining inventory investment is $10 million, which is a reduction of approximately $15 million from the third quarter of 2015. The reduction resulted from the sale of inventory during the fourth quarter of 2015. Global Economies Approximately half of our sales are outside of the United States. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results. Global Foreign Currency Markets During 2015, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against most global currencies, impacting our comparative results against 2014. We anticipate the trend to continue into 2016. As described in Note 8, we utilize our derivative program to mitigate risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures and our investments in foreign operations. 46 Table of Contents Russia and Ukraine The ongoing political turmoil, economic sanctions, as well as the depressed oil markets, have led to foreign currency pressure as well as higher localized interest rates within Russia and Ukraine. We have experienced no significant impact from these trends, and will continue to monitor the economic and political trends within the region. Net sales within Russia and Ukraine are approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales. Assets held in Russia and Ukraine at November 30, 2015 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets. Venezuela Venezuela is a country experiencing a highly inflationary economy as defined under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar has been the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings. The Venezuelan government has maintained currency controls since 2003 and has directed a series of formal currency devaluations, the last of which established the Venezuelan currency at 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. During the last two years, the Venezuelan government has taken the following actions: · In 2013, the establishment of a new foreign exchange mechanism known as the “Complementary System of Foreign Currency Acquirement” (“SICAD 1”). It operates similar to an auction system and allows entities to exchange a limited number of bolivares for U.S. dollars at a bid rate established via weekly auctions. As of November 30, 2015, the fiscal year end for our international operations, the SICAD 1 exchange rate closed at 13.5 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. · In January 2014, the replacement of the Commission for the Administration of Foreign Exchange (“CADIVI”) with a new foreign currency administration, the National Center for Foreign Commerce (“CENCOEX”), which did not impact the official fixed currency exchange rate of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. · In March 2014, the establishment of SICAD 2, which operated similar to SICAD 1. · In February 2015, SICAD 2 was replaced by SIMADI. The SIMADI exchange rate at November 30, 2015 was 199.5 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. The exchange mechanisms discussed above have become increasingly illiquid, and we believe that significant uncertainty continues to exist regarding the exchange mechanisms in Venezuela. As of the end of 2015, the increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to dollars through official currency exchange markets have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and the U.S. dollar. This has significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our Venezuelan businesses, including restrictions on the ability of our Venezuelan businesses to settle U.S. dollar-denominated obligations. The currency controls, coupled with importation restrictions, workforce regulations, pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements have significantly influenced our ability to make and execute operational decisions regarding our businesses in Venezuela. The inability of our Venezuelan businesses to pay dividends, which remain subject to Venezuelan government approvals, has continued to restrict our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our Venezuelan businesses. We expect the conditions described above will continue for the foreseeable future. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2015, given our high level of intercompany receivables, we pursued cash basis transactions to limit additional investment. As a result of these factors, we concluded that effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we do not meet the U.S. GAAP accounting criteria for control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, and began accounting for the investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016. This action resulted in a charge of $123.4 million ($80.9 million after tax) or $0.27 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2015, to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The fourth quarter 2015 charge included $85 million of intercompany receivables, as well as net assets of our Venezuelan businesses and accumulated foreign currency. Beginning in 2016, we will exclude the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries from our consolidated financial statements and record revenue related to the sale of inventory to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent that cash is received for those sales. Any dividends received from our Venezuelan subsidiaries will be recorded as income upon receipt of cash. The decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiaries was preceded by the remeasurement of our Venezuelan Water and Paper net assets during the second quarter of 2015 at the SIMADI exchange rate and the remeasurement of our Venezuelan Food & Beverage and Institutional net assets and bolivar portion of our Venezuelan Energy net assets at the SIMADI exchange rate during the third quarter of 2015. The combination of these actions resulted in charges of $165.9 million ($165.9 million after tax) through the first three quarters of 2015. As a result of the ownership structure of our Food & Beverage and Institutional operations in Venezuela, we reflected $11.1 million of the above charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income, resulting in a net charge of $154.8 million. The total charges during 2015 related to our actions in Venezuela were $278.2 million ($235.7 million after tax), $235.7 million net of the impact from noncontrolling interest, or $0.78 per diluted share. During 2015, Venezuelan net sales represented approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales and Venezuelan operating income represented approximately 4% of our consolidated operating income. 47 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS During January 2016, we issued $800 million of debt securities consisting of a three year 2.00% fixed rate noted for a par amount of $400 million and a seven year 3.25% fixed rate note for a par amount of $400 million. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper, repay the remaining term loan balance of $125 million and for general corporate purposes. Also during January 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converted our $400 million 2.00% debt mentioned above from a fixed rate to a floating rate interest rate. The interest rate swap was designated as a fair value hedge. Also during January 2016, we purchased certain assets of Keedak Limited, an oilfield chemical distributor in Nigeria. Pre-acquisition sales of the acquired business are approximately $15 million. During February 2016, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $300 million of our common stock. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:  Fixed currency sales  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales  Adjusted cost of sales  Adjusted gross margin  Fixed currency operating income  Adjusted operating income  Adjusted operating income margin  Adjusted fixed currency operating income  Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted net interest expense  Adjusted tax rate  Adjusted net income  Adjusted diluted earnings per share We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. We include in special (gains) and charges items that are unusual in nature and significant in amount. In order to better allow investors to compare underlying business performance period-to-period, we provide adjusted cost of sales, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted fixed currency operating income, adjusted fixed currency operating income margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net interest expense, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items. The exclusion of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items in such adjusted amounts help provide a better understanding of underlying business performance. EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting operating income. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are used as inputs to our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios, which we view as important indicators of our creditworthiness. The adjusted tax rate measure promotes period-to-period comparability of the underlying effective tax rate because it excludes the tax rate impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items which do not necessarily reflect costs associated with historical trends or expected future results. 48 Table of Contents We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency sales, acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales, fixed currency operating income and adjusted fixed currency operating income measures eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our sales, acquisition adjusted sales, operating income, adjusted operating income and acquisition adjusted operating income, respectively, and promote a better understanding of our underlying sales and operating income trends. Fixed currency amounts are based on translation into U.S. dollars at fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2015. Fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. Acquisition adjusted growth rates generally exclude the results of any acquired business from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. Presentation of 2015 versus 2014 acquisition adjusted growth rates continue to be handled in such a way. In addition, 2015 versus 2014 acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude our Venezuelan results of operations from both 2015 and 2014. For presentation of 2014 versus 2013 acquisition adjusted growth rates, due to the rapid pace at which the Champion business has been integrated within our Global Energy segment, including all customer selling activity, discrete financial data specific to the legacy Champion business is no longer available for post-acquisition periods. As such, to allow for a more meaningful 2014 versus 2013 comparison, specific to the Champion transaction, Champion’s results for the period prior to acquisition in 2013 have been included for purposes of providing acquisition adjusted growth rates. All other acquisitions and divestitures continue to be handled consistent with the mechanics described in the 2015 versus 2014 discussion above. The 2014 versus 2013 acquisition adjusted growth rates do not exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from either 2014 or 2013. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

31462,ECL,ECOLAB INC.,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. Comparability of Results Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. Fixed currency amounts for both 2015 and 2014 also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at the Marginal Currency System (“SIMADI”) rate at year end 2015 of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period, and is provided for informational purposes only. Venezuela Related Activities Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Prior to deconsolidation, due to the country’s highly inflationary economy, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar. As a result, currency remeasurement adjustments for non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and other transactional foreign currency exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings. Across the second through fourth quarters of 2015, the Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and Energy operating segments were converted from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to the SIMADI rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. As noted above, within our fixed currency sales and operating results, to present our historical Venezuelan bolivar operations at a consistent conversion rate, we have reflected all Venezuelan bolivar results for the 2015 and 2014 reporting years at a SIMADI conversion rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We continued to work aggressively through 2016's difficult environment, where lackluster global economies, significantly unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued depressed energy market activity presented multiple headwinds to our growth. We once again delivered superior results for customers at the lowest total operating cost to them, while also working aggressively to deliver margin improvement. We also continued to make significant investments in our customer, field and infrastructure technology as well as in our talent management systems, all key areas that will be critical to our long-term success. In this environment, our Global Institutional, Global Industrial and Other segments continued to show good fixed currency sales and earnings results. However, these were offset by a decline in the Global Energy segment, coupled with significantly unfavorable currency translation due to the strong dollar appreciation relative to other currencies. We worked aggressively to offset these headwinds, while making progress in our work to strengthen our businesses and position them for better growth in 2017. 24 Table of Contents Sales Reported sales declined 3% to $13.2 billion in 2016 from $13.5 billion in 2015. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales were flat compared to the prior year. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Net Sales” table on page 30 and the “Sales by Reportable Segment” table on page 36 for reconciliation information. Gross Margin Our reported gross margin was 47.5% of sales for 2016, which compared to our 2015 reported gross margin of 46.7%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2016 and 2015, our adjusted gross margin was 48.0% in 2016 and 47.3% in 2015. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin” table on page 30 for reconciliation information. Operating Income Reported operating income increased 23% to $1.9 billion in 2016, compared to $1.6 billion in 2015. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, decreased 2% in 2016. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3%. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Operating Income” table on page 34 and Operating Income by Reportable Segment table on page 36 for reconciliation information. Earnings Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) Reported diluted EPS increased 25% to $4.14 in 2016 compared to $3.32 in 2015. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years, driven primarily by Energy related charges in 2016 and Venezuelan related actions, restructuring charges and other gains and charges in both 2016 and 2015. Also in 2015, special (gains) and charges included acquisition and integration related costs that were completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items from both 2016 and 2015 were flat at $4.37 in both 2016 and 2015. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures, and the “Diluted EPS” table on page 35 for reconciliation information. Balance Sheet We remain committed to our stated objective of having an investment grade balance sheet, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/Baa1 by the major ratings agencies, and to achieving “A” range ratings metrics. We believe that our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates. Net Debt to EBITDA Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was 2.3 and 2.6 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA, was 2.2 for both 2016 and 2015. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures, and the “Net Debt to EBITDA” table on page 40 for reconciliation information. Cash Flow Cash flow from operating activities was $1.9 billion in 2016 compared to $2.0 billion in 2015. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. See the section entitled “Cash Flows” within this MD&A for further information. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in December 2016 to an indicated annual rate of $1.48 per share. The increase represents our 25th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 80th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”). 25 Table of Contents Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists, title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on services as they are performed. While we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers’ needs are best met in a high quality way, the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales. Our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in Note 17. Our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts, as discussed below. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. In addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. We estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $68 million and $75 million, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $14 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.2% in 2016, 2015 and 2014. We believe that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see Note 2. Accrued Liabilities Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. As with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations. We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see Note 15. 26 Table of Contents Actuarially Determined Liabilities Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses. The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table. · The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues rated Aa by Moody’s Investor Services or AA by Standard & Poors. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. For 2015 and 2014, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The change in approach did not affect the measurement of our plan obligations or the funded status of our plans. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2016, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 4.27% from 4.51% at year-end 2015. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2016, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 4.14% from 4.38% at year-end 2015. · The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used for determining the 2015, 2016 and 2017 U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.75%. · Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the 2015 and 2016 U.S. pension expenses was 4.32% and for 2017 it is 4.03%. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2016, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs and 7.25% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2023 and remain at those levels thereafter. · In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2016, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2016 projection scale (applied to the RP-2006 mortality table). The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans increased to $533 million as of December 31, 2016 from $513 million as of December 31, 2015 (both before tax), primarily due to current period net actuarial losses. The effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2016, on the December 31, 2016 funded status and 2017 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans: Effect on U.S. Pension Plans Increase in Higher Assumption Recorded 2017 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $65.7 $5.5 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A 4.8 Effect on U.S. Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans Increase in Higher Assumption Recorded 2017 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $5.1 $0.5 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A 0.0 Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information. 27 Table of Contents See Note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations. Self Insurance Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. Restructuring Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. These restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets. Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Restructuring charges were substantially completed within our two active plans (Combined and Energy) during the fourth quarter of 2015. Our restructuring liability balance was $40 million and $90 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For additional information on our current restructuring activities, see Note 3. Income Taxes Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. During interim periods, this expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. In the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period. Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return, but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements. During the first quarter of 2016 we early-adopted the accounting guidance that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, using the prospective application method. Periods prior to the first quarter of 2016 have not been retrospectively adjusted for adoption of this guidance. 28 Table of Contents U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings. It is impractical to determine the amount of incremental taxes on an ongoing basis that might arise if all undistributed earnings were distributed. Uncertain Tax Positions A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns (Ecolab and Nalco) through 2012. The IRS has completed examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns (Champion) through 2011 and tax year 2012 is closed by statute of limitations. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2013 and 2014 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. The majority of our tax reserves are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $76 million and $75 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For additional information on income taxes and adoption of new accounting guidance related to classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, see Note 12 and Note 2, respectively. Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets We periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships. Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer base acquired in our recent Nalco and Champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. Our customer retention rate and history of maintaining long-term relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future. Additionally, other less certain post-acquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions, induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships. If our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets. In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets We had total goodwill of $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our ten operating segments. 29 Table of Contents For our 2016 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our ten reporting units through a quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. Our goodwill impairment assessment for 2016 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin. We will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments. No events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016. As part of the Nalco merger, we added the “Nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2016. Based on this testing, no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016.

Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales. Our reported gross margin was 47.5%, 46.7% and 46.2% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our 2016, 2015 and 2014 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $66.0 million, $80.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the special (gains) and charges table on page 31. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2016 adjusted gross margin was 48.0% compared against a 2015 adjusted gross margin of 47.3%. The increase was driven primarily by lower delivered product costs, cost efficiencies and the impact of the decline in Global Energy, which on average has a lower gross margin. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 47.3% and 46.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was due primarily to delivered product cost savings and synergies. 30 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”) (percent) 2016 2015 2014 SG&A Ratio 32.7 % 32.1 % 32.1 % The increased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2016 against 2015 was driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions, investments in the business and the decline in Global Energy, which on average has a lower SG&A ratio. The consistent SG&A ratio comparing 2015 against 2014 resulted from the impact of net synergies and cost savings actions which were offset by investments in the business. Special (Gains) and Charges Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income included the following items: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Cost of sales Restructuring activities $(0.4) $16.5 $13.9 Inventory costs (6.2) (14.5) - Inventory reserves - 20.6 - Energy related charges 62.6 - - Fixed asset impairment and other inventory charges 10.0 24.7 0.4 Venezuela related activities - 33.3 - Subtotal 66.0 80.6 14.3 Special (gains) and charges Restructuring activities (8.7) 83.8 69.2 Champion and Nalco integration costs - 18.7 28.4 Energy related charges 14.2 - - Venezuela related activities (7.8) 256.0 - Other 41.8 56.3 (28.8) Subtotal 39.5 414.8 68.8 Operating income subtotal 105.5 495.4 83.1 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest Restructuring activities - (1.7) - Venezuela related activities - (11.1) - Subtotal - (12.8) - Total special (gains) and charges $105.5 $482.6 $83.1 For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting. Restructuring Activities Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3. Energy Restructuring Plan In April 2013, following the completion of the Champion transaction, we commenced plans to undertake restructuring and other cost-saving actions to realize our acquisition-related cost synergies as well as streamline and strengthen our position in the global energy market (the “Energy Restructuring Plan”). Actions associated with the acquisition to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the business included a reduction of the combined business’s global workforce. Actions also included leveraging and simplifying our global supply chain, including the reduction of plant, distribution center and redundant facility locations and product line optimization. Restructuring charges within the Energy Restructuring Plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016. Cumulative restructuring charges of $89 million ($60 million after tax and net of the impact from noncontrolling interest), are materially consistent with our initial expectation of $80 million ($55 million after tax). 31 Table of Contents We recorded restructuring charges of $4.5 million ($2.6 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share, $47.2 million ($33.0 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share and $9.5 million ($6.4 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result of the ownership structure of certain entities holding Energy Restructuring charges, we reflected $1.7 million of the 2015 charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Net cash payments under the Energy Restructuring Plan were $14.4 million during 2016 and $42.5 million from 2013 through 2015. The majority of cash payments under this plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. We anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will be funded from operating activities. During 2016 the Energy Restructuring Plan achieved approximately $25 million of incremental savings as compared to 2015. Cumulative cost savings from this plan, along with synergies achieved in connection with the acquisition, were approximately $150 million through 2016 and are materially consistent with our original expectations. Combined Restructuring Plan In February 2011, we commenced a comprehensive plan to substantially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our European business, as well as undertake certain restructuring activities outside of Europe, historically referred to as the “2011 Restructuring Plan”. Additionally, in January 2012, following the merger with Nalco, we formally commenced plans to undertake restructuring actions related to the reduction of our global workforce and optimization of our supply chain and office facilities, including planned reductions of plant and distribution center locations, historically referred to as the “Merger Restructuring Plan”. During the first quarter of 2013, we determined that the objectives of the plans discussed above were aligned, and consequently, the previously separate restructuring plans were combined into one plan. The combined restructuring plan (the “Combined Plan”) combines opportunities and initiatives from both plans and continues to follow the original format of the Merger Restructuring Plan by focusing on global actions related to optimization of the supply chain and office facilities, including reductions of the global workforce, plant and distribution center locations. Restructuring charges within the Combined Plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016. Cumulative restructuring charges of $391 million ($297 million after tax), are materially consistent with our initial expectation of $400 million ($300 million after tax). We recorded net gains of $13.6 million ($13.4 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share during 2016 primarily related to gains on the sale of certain facilities related to previous restructuring initiatives. We recorded net charges of $53.0 million ($44.2 million after tax) or $0.15 per diluted share and $73.5 million ($58.5 million after tax) or $0.19 per diluted share during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net cash payments under the Combined Plan were $14.9 million during 2016 and $303.1 million from 2011 through 2015. The majority of cash payments under the Combined Plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. We anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will continue to be funded from operating activities. During 2016, the Combined Plan achieved approximately $25 million of incremental savings as compared to 2015. Cumulative cost savings from this plan, along with annual cost saving and synergies, were approximately $420 million through 2016 and are materially consistent with our original expectations. Non-Restructuring Special (Gains) and Charges Energy related charges Oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures, which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in North America. During the second and fourth quarters of 2016, as a result of these conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook, we recorded total charges of $76.8 million ($50.0 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share, comprised of inventory write-downs and related disposal costs, fixed asset charges, headcount reductions and other charges. The inventory write-downs and related disposal costs of $40.5 million include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of certain specific-use and other products, coupled with declines in replacement costs, as well as estimated costs to dispose the respective excess inventory. The fixed asset charges of $20.4 million resulted from the write-down of certain assets related to the reduction of certain aspects of our North American operations within the Global Energy segment, as well as abandonment of certain projects under construction. The carrying value of the corresponding fixed assets was reduced to zero. The employee termination costs of $13.1 million include a reduction in our Global Energy segment’s global workforce to better align its workforce with anticipated activity levels in the near term. As of the end of 2016, we had $7.4 million of corresponding severance remaining to be paid, which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months and be funded from operating activities. The charges discussed above have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 32 Table of Contents Venezuela related activities Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for the investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016. We used the cost method of accounting for the investment in our Venezuelan subsidiaries throughout 2016 as the conditions within Venezuela driving this decision remained in place during 2016. Prior to deconsolidation, we remeasured our Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and the bolivar portion of our Venezuelan operations within Energy operating segments from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to the SIMADI rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. As a result of the ownership structure of our Food & Beverage and Institutional operations in Venezuela, we reflected a portion of the devaluation impact as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon deconsolidation, we recorded a charge to fully write off our intercompany receivables and investment. The total charges during 2015 related to our actions in Venezuela were $289.3 million ($246.8 million after tax). As a result of the ownership structure of our Food & Beverage and Institutional operations in Venezuela, we reflected $11.1 million of the above charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income, resulting in a net charge of $235.7 million or $0.78 per diluted share. During 2016, we recorded a gain of $7.8 million ($4.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share resulting from U.S. dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation. Venezuela related charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Fixed asset impairment and other inventory charges During 2015, we recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of $24.7 million ($15.4 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our U.S. plants. The impaired facility is a specialized facility used for dry polymer production. Due to market contraction in the oil and the mining industries, and the aggressive competitive pricing environment for dry polymers, the facility has not reached production volumes to recover the value of the underlying fixed assets. During 2016, we recorded an additional charge of $10.0 million ($6.3 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share related to the dry polymer fixed asset impairment, as well as related inventory charges. Subsequent to the charge, the remaining value of the underlying fixed assets is less than $5 million. Inventory charges include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of the corresponding dry polymer products. These items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Inventory costs and inventory reserve During 2015, we improved and standardized estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing, resulting in a net pre-tax charge of approximately $6 million. Separately, the actions resulted in a charge of $20.6 million ($15.9 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, related to inventory reserve calculations, partially offset by a gain of $14.5 million ($12.2 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory. During 2016, we took additional actions related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million ($4.6 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share. These items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Champion and Nalco integration costs Integration related special charges for the Champion acquisition and Nalco merger were completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, and we did not incur any special charges related to such transactions during 2016. As a result of the Champion acquisition and Nalco merger, we incurred charges of $18.7 million ($12.0 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share and $28.4 million ($19.8 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share, during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Champion and Nalco integration charges have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Other special (gains) and charges During 2016, we recorded charges of $41.8 million ($26.4 million after tax) or $0.09 per diluted share, primarily consisting of litigation related charges. During 2015, we recorded a net charge of $56.3 million ($34.5 million after tax), or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily made up of litigation related charges and the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our Ecovation business, offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the Champion transaction. 33 Table of Contents During 2014, we recorded a special gain of $28.4 million ($23.3 million after tax), or $0.08 per diluted share, as a result of a favorable licensing settlement and other settlement gains, the consolidation of the Emirates National Chemicals Company LLC (“Emochem”) entity and removal of the corresponding equity method investment and the disposition of a business. The charges discussed above have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Operating Income and Operating Income Margin Percent Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Reported GAAP operating income $1,915.0 $1,561.3 $1,955.0 23 % (20) % Special (gains) and charges 105.5 495.4 83.1 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income 2,020.5 2,056.7 2,038.1 (2) 1 Effect of foreign currency translation (32.2) (129.1) (251.3) Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income $1,988.3 $1,927.6 $1,786.8 3 % 8 % (percent) 2016 2015 2014 Reported GAAP operating income margin 14.6 % 11.5 % 13.7 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin 15.4 % 15.2 % 14.3 % Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 15.3 % 14.9 % 14.0 % Our reported operating income increased 23% when comparing 2016 to 2015 and decreased 20% when comparing 2015 to 2014. Our reported operating income for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2016 adjusted operating income decreased 2% when compared to 2015 adjusted operating income and 2015 adjusted operating income increased 1% when compared to 2014 adjusted operating income. As shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted operating income growth for both 2016 and 2015, as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3% for 2016 and 8% for 2015. Acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted our 2016 adjusted fixed currency operating income growth rates by approximately 1 percentage point. In 2015, acquisitions and divestitures added 1 percentage point to fixed currency operating income growth. As addressed further in the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A, comparisons across 2014 to 2016 were impacted by growth in Global Industrial, Global Institutional and Other offset by the continued challenges within Global Energy. Interest Expense, Net Reported net interest expense totaled $264.6 million, $243.6 million and $256.6 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2016 net interest expense compared to 2015 net interest expense was driven primarily by higher weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt. The decrease in 2015 net interest expense compared to 2014 net interest expense was driven primarily by lower weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt. Provision for Income Taxes The following table provides a summary of our tax rate: (percent) 2016 2015 2014 Reported GAAP tax rate 24.4 % 22.8 % 28.0 % Tax rate impact of: Special gains and charges 1.0 (0.4) (0.1) Discrete tax items (0.2) 3.5 (0.7) Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 25.2 % 25.9 % 27.2 % Our reported tax rate for 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our overall non-GAAP adjusted tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. Our 2016 reported tax rate includes $43.1 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expenses of $3.9 million associated with discrete tax items. Our 2015 reported tax rate includes $105.7 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of $63.3 million associated with discrete tax items. Our 2014 reported tax rate includes $21.6 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expense of $13.2 million associated with discrete tax items. The corresponding impact of these items on the reported tax rate is shown in the table above. 34 Table of Contents During 2016, we recognized net expenses related to discrete tax items of $3.9 million. The net expenses were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 U.S. federal income tax return, partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions. Net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of $20.6 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of $39.0 million for the tax basis in a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary. Net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2014 were driven primarily by an update to non-current tax liabilities for certain global tax audits, an adjustment related to the re-characterization of intercompany payments between our U.S. and foreign affiliates, the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in our deferred state tax rate, recognizing adjustments from filing our 2013 U.S. federal and state tax returns, net changes of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and the impact from other foreign country audit settlements. The decrease in our adjusted tax rate from 2014 to 2016 was impacted by global tax planning projects, as well as favorable geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, U.S. domestic tax reform proposals, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Net Income Attributable to Ecolab Percent Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Reported GAAP net income attributable to Ecolab $1,229.6 $1,002.1 $1,202.8 23 % (17) % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges, after tax 62.4 376.9 61.5 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) 3.9 (63.3) 13.2 Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab $1,295.9 $1,315.7 $1,277.5 (2) % 3 % Diluted EPS Percent Change (dollars) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Reported GAAP diluted EPS $4.14 $3.32 $3.93 25 % (16) % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges 0.21 1.25 0.20 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) 0.01 (0.21) 0.04 Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS $4.37 $4.37 $4.18 0 % 5 % Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding. Currency translation had a significant unfavorable impact on reported and adjusted diluted EPS comparability across 2014 to 2016, with headwinds of approximately $0.31 per share for 2016 compared to 2015 and approximately $0.30 per share for 2015 compared to 2014. 35 Table of Contents SEGMENT PERFORMANCE The non-U.S. dollar functional international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates used by management for 2016. The difference between the fixed currency exchange rates and the actual currency exchange rates is reported as “effect of foreign currency translation” in the following tables. Fixed currency amounts for both 2015 and 2014 also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. All other accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with U.S. GAAP and the accounting policies described in Note 2. Additional information about our reportable segments is included in Note 17. Fixed currency net sales and operating income for 2016, 2015 and 2014 for our reportable segments are shown in the following tables.

At a regional level, the 2016 sales increase was impacted by good growth in Latin America and moderate growth in Middle East/Africa (“MEA”) and Europe. Regional results for 2015 were impacted by strong growth in Latin America and MEA, moderate growth in Europe and modest gains in North America. At an operating segment level, Water fixed currency sales increased 3% in 2016 (increase of 1% acquisition adjusted), as growth in light industry sales was offset by a double digit decline in the mining industry. Fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2015, (increase of 3% acquisition adjusted) with good growth in the light and heavy industries, which offset slower sales in mining. Food & Beverage fixed currency sales increased 3% in 2016, benefiting from corporate account and share gains, which more than offset generally flat industry trends. Sales in the beverage and food markets showed good growth, with slower sales in the dairy and agri markets. Fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2015, (increase of 4% acquisition adjusted). Growth was led by the beverage and brewing market, with modest gains in the dairy and food markets. Paper fixed currency sales increased 2% in 2016, helped by strong sales efforts and business wins. Market conditions in Asia Pacific, including Greater China, have remained challenging. Fixed currency sales increased 2% in 2015 impacted by new account gains and continued technology penetration. Textile Care fixed currency sales increased 4% in 2016, benefiting from new customer accounts in Europe. Fixed currency sales increased 5% in 2015, impacted by new accounts and customer penetration within North America and Europe. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins for Global Industrial increased in both 2016 and 2015. Acquisitions negatively impacted fixed currency operating income growth and fixed currency operating income margins. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased 1.3 percentage points in both 2016 and 2015, benefiting from favorable impact of sales volume gains, product mix changes and pricing gains, which added approximately 1.3 and 1.2 percentage points in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins were also impacted by cost savings initiatives and lower delivered product costs, offset by investments in the business.

Net Sales Fixed currency sales growth for Global Institutional in both 2016 and 2015 benefited from volume increases and pricing gains. At a regional level, the 2016 sales increase was led by good growth in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific. The 2015 sales increase was led by strong growth in Asia Pacific and MEA, good growth in North America and Latin America, and modest gains in Europe. At an operating segment level, Institutional fixed currency sales increased 8% in 2016 (increase of 5% acquisition adjusted). New business wins, led by demand for our leading product innovation in key platforms, along with appropriate pricing, drove our results. 37 Table of Contents Global lodging demand showed marginal growth while restaurant foot traffic data remains soft. Fixed currency sales increased 7% (increase of 6% acquisition adjusted) in 2015, as sales initiatives, new accounts and globalization of our leading technologies drove growth. Specialty fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2016. Both quick service and food retail sales growth were solid, led by account growth, new customers and product penetration. Fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2015. Quick service sales were solid, benefiting from new accounts and new product penetration; our food retail business showed good sales growth. Healthcare fixed currency sales increased 4% in 2016, as improving trends in both North America and Europe reflected the continued focus on our value proposition, leading to customer gains and product penetration. Fixed currency sales increased 2% in 2015, benefiting from new account growth, customer penetration and product introductions. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins increased for Global Institutional in both 2016 and 2015. Acquisitions negatively impacted fixed currency operating income growth and fixed currency operating income margins. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased 1.3 and 1.6 percentage points in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The favorable impact of pricing gains, product mix changes and sales volume increases added approximately 1.9 and 2.3 percentage points in both 2016 and 2015, respectively, partially offset by investments in the business. Delivered product cost savings in 2015 also impacted comparisons.

Net Sales Fixed currency sales for Global Energy were negatively impacted by volume reductions and lower pricing for both 2016 and 2015. Across both comparable periods, continued difficult operating conditions negatively impacted our well stimulation and production businesses due to lower pricing and customer product usage. Sales in our downstream business were flat in 2016 and grew modestly in 2015. Market challenges in North America drove the reductions from a regional perspective in both 2016 and 2015. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income for Global Energy decreased during both 2016 and 2015. Fixed currency operating income margins also decreased during both comparable periods. Acquisitions had a minimal impact on the fixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins during both 2016 and 2015. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins for our Global Energy segment decreased 2.4 and 0.7 percentage points in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Reductions in sales volume, product mix changes and lower pricing contributed approximately 5.7 and 3.5 percentage points to the decline in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and which offset the benefit of lower delivered product costs, synergies and other cost reduction actions. 38 Table of Contents Other 2016 2015 2014 Sales at fixed currency (millions) $806.5 $747.1 $705.2 Sales at public currency (millions) 809.8 763.4 751.8 Volume 6 % 4 % Price changes 2 % 2 % Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change 8 % 7 % Acquisitions and divestitures (0) % (1) % Fixed currency sales change 8 % 6 % Foreign currency translation (2) % (4) % Public currency sales change 6 % 2 % Operating income at fixed currency (millions) $148.1 $127.5 $109.9 Operating income at public currency (millions) 148.0 129.3 116.3 Fixed currency operating income change 16 % 16 % Fixed currency operating income margin 18.4 % 17.1 % 15.6 % Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income change 16 % 16 % Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 18.4 % 17.1 % 15.6 % Public currency operating income change 14 % 11 % Amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding. Net Sales Fixed currency sales growth for Other in both 2016 and 2015 was driven by volume increases and pricing gains. At a regional level, the 2016 sales increase was led by good growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America, North America and MEA. The 2015 sales increase was led by good growth in Latin America, North America and Asia Pacific, with moderate gains in Europe. At an operating segment level, Pest Elimination fixed currency sales increased 8% in 2016, impacted by continued gains in the foodservice market, benefiting from customer penetration and new service offerings. Fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2015, impacted by gains in the foodservice market. Equipment Care fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2016, driven by continued increases in both service and parts sales, benefiting from new customer additions. Fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2015, driven by increases in both service and parts sales. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income growth and the corresponding operating margin for our Other segment increased in both 2016 and 2015. Fixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins for our Other segment increased 1.3 and 1.5 percentage points in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The favorable impact of pricing gains, product mix changes and sales volume increases added approximately 2.4 and 2.7 percentage points for 2016 and 2015, respectively and was partially offset by investments in business and other cost increases. Corporate Consistent with our internal management reporting, Corporate amounts in the table on page 36 include intangible asset amortization specifically from the Nalco merger and special (gains) and charges that are not allocated to our reportable segments. Items included within special (gains) and charges are shown in the table on page 31. 39 Table of Contents FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY Financial Position Total assets were $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2016, compared to total assets of $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in assets was driven primarily by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the value of our foreign assets translated into U.S. dollars as of year end 2016 and 2015, the impact of adopting the accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as discussed in Note 2, and the impact of intangible asset amortization. Total liabilities were $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2016, compared to total liabilities of $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. Total debt was $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2015. See further discussion of our debt activity within the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this MD&A. Our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBIDTA are shown in the following table. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures, which are discussed further in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this MD&A. 2016 2015 2014 (ratio) Net debt to EBITDA 2.3 2.6 2.2 Net debt to adjusted EBITDA 2.2 2.2 2.2 (millions) Total debt $6,687.0 $6,465.5 $6,548.2 Cash 327.4 92.8 209.6 Net debt $6,359.6 $6,372.7 $6,338.6 Net income including non-controlling interest $1,247.1 $1,017.2 $1,222.2 Provision for income taxes 403.3 300.5 476.2 Interest expense, net 264.6 243.6 256.6 Depreciation 561.0 559.5 558.1 Amortization 289.7 300.0 313.9 EBITDA 2,765.7 2,420.8 2,827.0 Special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA 105.5 495.4 83.1 Adjusted EBITDA $2,871.2 $2,916.2 $2,910.1 Cash Flows Operating Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Cash provided by operating activities $1,939.7 $1,999.8 $1,815.6 $(60.1) $184.2 We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business, debt repayments and pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2014 to 2016 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable (“working capital”), the combination of which increased $35 million, $119 million and $212 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The cash flow impact across the three years from accounts receivable was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections. The cash flow impact across the three years from inventories was impacted by timing of purchases and production and usage levels, and from accounts payable was impacted by volume of purchases and timing of payments. The impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table: Dollar Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Pensions and postretirement plan contributions $211.8 $64.9 $76.7 $146.9 $(11.8) Restructuring payments 51.6 61.7 85.3 (10.1) (23.6) Income tax payments 359.1 533.1 522.0 (174.0) 11.1 Interest payments 267.0 237.2 255.5 29.8 (18.3) 40 Table of Contents Investing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Cash used for investing activities $(829.5) $(915.8) $(848.3) $86.3 $(67.5) Cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business. Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $49 million, $265 million and $72 million, respectively. Our acquisitions and divestitures across 2016, 2015 and 2014 are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth. We continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. Total capital expenditures, including software, were $757 million, $815 million and $794 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Comparability of cash used for investing activities across 2014 to 2016 was impacted by other factors, including the following: · Restricted cash activity in 2016 related to the pending Anios transaction, as discussed further in Note 4. · Settlement of a net investment hedges in 2016, 2015 and 2014. · Receipt of Champion related escrow funds in 2015. Financing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Cash used for financing activities $(868.2) $(1,150.9) $(1,071.0) $282.7 $(79.9) Our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent consideration. Our 2016 debt financing activities included the issuance of €575 million 1.00%, $750 million 2.70%, $250 million 3.70%, $400 million 2.00% and $400 million 3.25% fixed rate senior notes; the scheduled repayment of our $1.25 billion 3.00% and €175 million 4.585% senior notes and repayment of the remaining $125 million of our term loan borrowings. Net issuances and repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of $606 million during 2016. Our 2015 debt financing activities included the issuance of $300 million 1.55%, $300 million 2.25% and €575 million 2.625% fixed rate senior notes; the scheduled repayment of our $250 million 4.875% and $500 million 1.00% senior notes; and repayment of $275 million of term loan borrowings. Net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of $312 million during 2015. Our 2014 debt financing activities included the repayment of $400 million of term loan borrowings, and the scheduled repayment of our $500 million 2.375% senior notes. Net borrowings of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net cash inflow of $600 million during 2014. Shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. In February 2015, we announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was completed during the second quarter of 2016. We repurchased a total of $740 million and $755 million of shares in 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts include $300 million of shares repurchased through the ASR program in both 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 10 for further information regarding our ASR programs. During 2014, we repurchased $429 million of shares. Cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity. In December 2016, we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 6%. This represents the 25th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. We have paid dividends on our common stock for 80 consecutive years. Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year 2016 $0.350 $0.350 $0.350 $0.370 $1.420 2015 0.330 0.330 0.330 0.350 1.340 2014 0.275 0.275 0.275 0.330 1.155 41 Table of Contents Financing activities for 2014 also included an acquisition-related contingent consideration payment of $86 million made to Champion’s former shareholders. Liquidity and Capital Resources We currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2017, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension contributions, with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong. As of December 31, 2016, we had $327 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $184 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, we had $26 million of deferred tax liabilities for pre-acquisition foreign earnings associated with the legacy Nalco entities and legacy Champion entities that we intended to repatriate. These liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction. The remaining foreign earnings were repatriated in 2016, reducing the deferred tax liabilities to zero at December 31, 2016. We consider the remaining portion of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and we have no intention to repatriate such funds. We continue to be focused on building our global business and these funds are available for use by our international operations. To the extent the remaining portion of the foreign earnings would be repatriated, such amounts would be subject to income tax or foreign withholding tax liabilities that may be fully or partially offset by foreign tax credits, both in the U.S. and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2016 we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in December 2019. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2016 or 2015. The credit facility supports our $2.0 billion U.S. commercial paper program and $2.0 billion European commercial paper program. We increased the European commercial paper program from $200 million during the third quarter of 2016. Combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2016, we had no amount outstanding under either our U.S. or European commercial paper programs. Additionally, we have other committed and uncommitted credit lines of $746 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs, including with respect to bank supported letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees. Approximately $554 million of these credit lines were available for use as of year-end 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our short-term borrowing program was rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s. As of December 31, 2016, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Baa1 (stable outlook), respectively. A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs, or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. Should this occur, we could seek additional sources of funding, including issuing additional term notes or bonds. In addition, we have the ability, at our option, to draw upon our $2.0 billion of committed credit facility prior to termination. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures. A schedule of our obligations as of December 31, 2016 under various notes payable, long-term debt agreements, operating leases with noncancelable terms in excess of one year and interest obligations are summarized in the following table: Payments Due by Period Less More Than 2-3 4-5 Than (millions) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Notes payable $30 $30 $ - $ - $ - Commercial paper - - - - - Long-term debt 6,652 510 967 1,567 3,608 Capital lease obligations 5 1 1 1 2 Operating leases 431 102 153 105 71 Interest* 2,261 218 396 360 1,287 Total $9,379 $861 $1,517 $2,033 $4,968 *Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year-end 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $76 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. 42 Table of Contents We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2017 based on plan asset values as of December 31, 2016. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $42 million in 2017. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles. Except for the approximately $192 million utilized under the bank lines noted previously supporting domestic and international commercial relationships and transactions, we do not have significant unconditional purchase obligations or significant other commercial commitments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, as discussed further in Note 13, we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary. The joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. These entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Market Risk We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges. We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2016, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $1,450 million. See Note 8 for further information on our hedging activity. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $50 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items. GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT Energy Markets During 2016, approximately 23% of our sales were generated from Global Energy, the results of which, as noted further below, are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets. Oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016, when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures, which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in North America. We also experienced additional pricing headwinds in 2016 when compared to 2015. As a result of these conditions, we recorded charges related to inventory write-downs and related disposal costs, fixed asset charges, employee termination costs and other charges during the second and fourth quarters of 2016, as discussed further in Note 3. Demand for oil and overall energy consumption has remained consistent. Our global footprint and broad business portfolio within Global Energy, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. As such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment. As petroleum derived materials are key inputs to many of our chemical products, lower oil prices provide benefits across our segments in the form of lower raw material costs. 43 Table of Contents Global Economies Approximately half of our sales are outside of the United States. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results. Brexit Referendum The June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (“Brexit”) resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Brexit is non-binding; however, if passed into law, negotiations would commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. During 2016, net sales of our U.K. operations were approximately 3% of our consolidated net sales. Global Foreign Currency Markets The U.S. dollar remained strong against most global currencies during 2016, when compared against both 2015 and 2014 levels, impacting our comparative results. As described in Note 8, we utilize our derivative program to mitigate risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures and our investments in foreign operations. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In January 2017, we acquired Abednego Environmental Services (“Abednego”), a privately held company based in Novi, Michigan. Abednego provides water solutions to automotive customers. Pre-acquisition annual sales were approximately $40 million. On February 1, 2017, we acquired Anios for a total consideration of approximately $800 million in cash, inclusive of the satisfaction of outstanding debt. Anios is a leading European manufacturer and marketer of hygiene and disinfection products for the healthcare, food service, and food and beverage processing industries. Anios provides an innovative product line that expands the solutions we are able to offer while also providing a complementary geographic footprint within the healthcare market. Pre-acquisition annual sales were approximately $245 million. In February 2017, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $300 million of our common stock. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:  Fixed currency sales  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales  Adjusted cost of sales  Adjusted gross margin  Fixed currency operating income  Fixed currency operating income margin  Adjusted operating income  Adjusted operating income margin  Adjusted fixed currency operating income  Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted tax rate  Adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab  Adjusted diluted EPS 44 Table of Contents We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges. EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are used as inputs to our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2016. Fixed currency amounts also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar, which was the approximate conversion rate for SIMADI at year end 2015. Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from both the current period and comparable period of the prior year. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. See discussion appearing under the headings entitled ""Market Risk"" and “Global Environment” within the MD&A of this Form 10-K. 45 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:49:04.267100
31462,ECL,ECOLAB INC.,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. Comparability of Results Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. Fixed currency amounts for 2015 also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at the Marginal Currency System (“SIMADI”) rate at year end 2015 of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period, and is provided for informational purposes only. Venezuela Related Activities Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Prior to deconsolidation, due to the country’s highly inflationary economy, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar. As a result, currency remeasurement adjustments for non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and other transactional foreign currency exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings. Across the second through fourth quarters of 2015, the Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and Energy operating segments were converted from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to the SIMADI rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. As noted above, within our fixed currency sales and operating results, to present our historical Venezuelan bolivar operations at a consistent conversion rate, we have reflected all Venezuelan bolivar results for the 2015 reporting year at a SIMADI conversion rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We achieved accelerating sales and earnings growth through 2017 as we drove new product introductions, new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a mixed market environment. Increased pricing was implemented to offset higher delivered product costs. Earnings per share leveraged the solid operating income growth, benefiting from lower interest expense, taxes and shares outstanding, to deliver the solid EPS growth. Sales Reported sales increased 5% to $13.8 billion in 2017 from $13.2 billion in 2016. Sales were positively impacted by volume, pricing and acquisitions. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 5% compared to the prior year. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Net Sales” table on page 32 and the “Sales by Reportable Segment” table on page 38 for reconciliation information. 25 Table of Contents Gross Margin Our reported gross margin was 46.5% of sales for 2017, compared to our 2016 reported gross margin of 47.5%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2017 and 2016, our adjusted gross margin was 46.8% in 2017 and 48.0% in 2016. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin” table on page 32 for reconciliation information. Operating Income Reported operating income increased 5% to $2.0 billion in 2017, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, increased 2% in 2017. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 2%. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Operating Income” table on page 35 and “Operating Income by Reportable Segment” table on page 38 for reconciliation information. Earnings Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) Reported diluted EPS increased 24% to $5.13 in 2017 compared to $4.14 in 2016. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform, restructuring charges, other discrete taxes, acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of Equipment Care. Special (gains) and charges in 2016 were driven primarily by Energy related charges, Venezuelan related actions, restructuring charges and other gains and charges. Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased to $4.69 in 2017 compared to $4.37 in 2016. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures, and the “Diluted EPS” table on page 37 for reconciliation information. Balance Sheet We remain committed to our stated objective of having an investment grade balance sheet, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/Baa1 by the major ratings agencies, and to achieving “A” range ratings metrics. We believe our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates. Net Debt to EBITDA Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was 2.4 and 2.3 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA, was 2.4 for 2017 and 2.2 for 2016. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures, and the “Net Debt to EBITDA” table on page 43 for reconciliation information. Cash Flow Cash flow from operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2017 compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. See the section entitled “Cash Flows” within this MD&A for further information. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend 11% in December 2017 to an indicated annual rate of $1.64 per share. The increase represents our 26th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 81st consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead. 26 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”). Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists, title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on services as they are performed. While we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers’ needs are best met in a high quality way, the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales. Our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in Note 17. Our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts, as discussed below. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Committee 606 (ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance on how revenue with customers should be recognized. For additional information on our adoption of this accounting standard, see Note 2. Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. In addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible. We estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $72 million and $68 million, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $15 million and $14 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.1% in 2017 and 0.2% in 2016 and 2015. We believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see Note 2. 27 Table of Contents Accrued Liabilities Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. As with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations. We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see Note 15. Actuarially Determined Liabilities Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses. The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table. · The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues rated Aa by Moody’s Investor Services or AA by Standard & Poors. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2017 and 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The change in approach did not affect the measurement of our plan obligations or the funded status of our plans. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2017, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 3.70% from 4.27% at year-end 2016. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2017, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 3.66% from 4.14% at year-end 2016. · The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used for determining the 2016, 2017 and 2018 U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.75%. · Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the 2016 U.S. pension expenses was 4.32%, for 2017 it was 4.03%, and for 2018 it is 4.03%. · For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2017, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.25% for pre-65 costs and 11.5% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2028 and remain at those levels thereafter. · In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2017, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2017 projection scale (applied to the RP-2006 mortality table). The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans decreased to $527 million as of December 31, 2017 from $533 million as of December 31, 2016 (both before tax), primarily due to the amortization of prior period net actuarial losses. 28 Table of Contents The effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2017, on the December 31, 2017 funded status and 2018 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans: Effect on U.S. Pension Plans Increase in Higher Assumption Recorded 2018 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $77.2 $6.0 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A 5.2 Effect on U.S. Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans Increase in Higher Assumption Recorded 2018 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $5.2 $0.6 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A - Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information. See Note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations. Self Insurance Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. Restructuring Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. These restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets. Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our restructuring liability balance was $42 million and $40 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For additional information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3. 29 Table of Contents Income Taxes Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously indefinitely reinvested and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Tax Act adds many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI), the base erosion anti abuse tax (BEAT) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII). Some of these provisions, such as the tax on GILTI, may not apply to the Company with full effect until future years. The Company is assessing the impact of the provisions of the Act that do not apply until later years. The two material items that impact us for 2017 are the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate, as it relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet, and the one-time transition tax that is imposed on our unremitted foreign earnings. We have recorded provisional amounts for the income tax effects that included the reporting period the Tax Act was enacted. Judgement was used when applying the provisions of the Tax Act, including assumptions related to the impact of the lower corporate rate, and other analyses including, but not limited to, estimates of assets and liabilities at future dates and our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income. Our provisional amounts are subject to further adjustments during the measurement period of up to one year following enactment of the Tax Act, as provided by recent SEC guidance. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. This expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. In the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period. Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return, but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, U.S. deferred income taxes had not been provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings. Upon enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years. We will continue to assert permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates, and if our policy changes we would record applicable taxes. For additional information on income taxes see Note 12. Uncertain Tax Positions A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns (Ecolab and Nalco) through 2014. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2015 and 2016 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. 30 Table of Contents The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. The majority of our tax reserves are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $62 million and $76 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For additional information on income taxes see Note 12. Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets We periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $7.0 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships. Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer base acquired in our recent Nalco and Champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. Our customer retention rate and history of maintaining long-term relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future. Additionally, other less certain post-acquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions, induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships. If our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets. In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets We had total goodwill of $7.2 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments (ten subsequent to the divestiture of the Equipment Care business). For our 2017 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our eleven reporting units through a quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. Our goodwill impairment assessment for 2017 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin. We will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we sold the Equipment Care business, which was one of our reporting units and operating segments, and the goodwill associated with Equipment Care was disposed of upon sale. No goodwill impairment was realized as a result of the sale, and no other events occurred during the second half of 2017 indicating a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2017. As part of the Nalco merger, we added the “Nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2017. Based on this testing, no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2017 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2017. 31 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Percent Change (millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Reported GAAP net sales $13,838.3 $13,152.8 $13,545.1 5 % (3) % Effect of foreign currency translation (192.1) (148.0) (566.6) Non-GAAP fixed currency sales $13,646.2 $13,004.8 $12,978.5 5 % 0 % The percentage components of the year-over-year sales change are shown below: (percent) 2017 2016 Volume 3% (1)% Price changes 1 0 Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change 4 (1) Acquisitions & divestitures 1 1 Fixed currency sales change 5 0 Foreign currency translation 0 (3) Reported GAAP net sales change 5% (3)% Cost of Sales (“COS”) and Gross Profit Margin (“Gross Margin”) 2017 2016 2015 Gross Gross Gross (millions/percent) COS Margin COS Margin COS Margin Reported GAAP COS and gross margin $7,405.1 46.5 % $6,898.9 47.5 % $7,223.5 46.7 % Special (gains) and charges 44.0 0.3 66.0 0.5 80.6 0.6 Non-GAAP adjusted COS and gross margin $7,361.1 46.8 % $6,832.9 48.0 % $7,142.9 47.3 % Our COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table. Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales. Our reported gross margin was 46.5%, 47.5%, and 46.7% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our 2017, 2016 and 2015 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $44.0 million, $66.0 million, and $80.6 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the “Special (Gains) and Charges” table on page 33. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2017 adjusted gross margin was 46.8% compared against a 2016 adjusted gross margin of 48.0%. The decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs and an increase in Global Energy (which on average has a lower gross margin), which more than offset pricing and cost savings. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 48.0% and 47.3% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by lower delivered product costs, cost efficiencies and the impact of the decline in Global Energy, which on average has a lower gross margin. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”) (percent) 2017 2016 2015 SG&A Ratio 31.9 % 32.7 % 32.1 % The decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2017 against 2016 was driven primarily by sales volume leverage and cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business and the impact of acquisitions. The increased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2016 against 2015 was driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions, investments in the business, and the decline in Global Energy, which on average has a lower SG&A ratio. 32 Table of Contents Special (Gains) and Charges Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income included the following items: (millions) 2017 2016 2015 Cost of sales Restructuring activities $4.6 $(0.4) $16.5 Acquisition and integration costs 13.2 - - Fixed asset impairment and other charges 26.2 10.0 24.7 Inventory costs and reserves - (6.2) 6.1 Energy related charges - 62.6 - Venezuela related activities - - 33.3 Subtotal 44.0 66.0 80.6 Special (gains) and charges Restructuring activities 39.9 (8.7) 83.8 Acquisition and integration costs 15.4 8.6 18.7 Gain on sale of business (46.1) - - Energy related charges - 14.2 - Venezuela related activities (11.5) (7.8) 256.0 Other (1.4) 33.2 56.3 Subtotal (3.7) 39.5 414.8 Operating income subtotal 40.3 105.5 495.4 Interest expense, net 21.9 - - Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest Restructuring activities - - (1.7) Venezuela related activities - - (11.1) Subtotal - - (12.8) Total special (gains) and charges $62.2 $105.5 $482.6 For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting. Restructuring Activities Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3. During the second quarter of 2017, we commenced restructuring and other cost-saving actions in order to streamline our operations. These actions include a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 570 positions, as well as asset disposals and lease terminations. As a result of these actions, we have incurred restructuring charges of $45.5 million ($32.7 million after tax) or $0.11 per diluted share, during 2017. Actions were substantially completed in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the restructuring liability balance related to these activities was $23.2 million. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2017, related to actions initiated in 2017, were $17.8 million. We recorded net restructuring gains related to legacy restructuring plans that commenced prior to 2015 of $1.0 million ($0.04 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share during 2017. We recorded net restructuring gains of $9.1 million ($10.8 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share in 2016 and net restructuring charges of $100.3 million ($77.2 million after tax) or $0.25 per diluted share during 2015. The legacy restructuring plans liability balance was $18.3 million, $39.6 million, and $90.1 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The reduction in liability balance was driven primarily by severance and other cash payments. The remaining accrual is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and continues to be funded from operating activities. 33 Table of Contents Acquisition and integration related costs Acquisition and integration costs reported in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2017 include $13.2 million ($8.6 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share related primarily to disposal of excess inventory upon the closure of Swisher plants, accelerated rent expense, and amounts related to recognition of fair value step-up in the Anios inventory. Acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2017 include $15.4 million ($9.9 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share of acquisition costs, advisory and legal fees, and integration charges for the Anios and Swisher acquisitions during 2017. During 2016, we incurred acquisition and integration charges of $8.6 million ($5.4 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share primarily related to the Swisher acquisition. During 2015, as a result of the Champion acquisition and Nalco merger, we incurred charges of $18.7 million ($12.0 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share. The charges have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further information related to our acquisitions is included in Note 4. Fixed asset impairment and other charges During 2017, we recorded other charges of $26.2 million ($19.7 million after tax), or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily relating to fixed asset impairments and a Global Energy vendor contract termination. During 2015, we recorded fixed asset impairment charge of $24.7 million ($15.4 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our U.S. plants. During 2016, we recorded an additional charge of $10.0 million ($6.3 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share related to the dry polymer fixed asset impairment, as well as related inventory charges. Subsequent to the charge, the remaining value of the underlying fixed assets was less than $5 million. Inventory charges include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of the corresponding dry polymer products. These items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Inventory costs and reserve During 2015, we improved and standardized estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing, resulting in a net pre-tax charge of $6.1 million. Separately, the actions resulted in a charge of $20.6 million ($15.9 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, related to inventory reserve calculations, partially offset by a gain of $14.5 million ($12.2 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory. During 2016, we took additional actions related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million ($4.6 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share. Energy related charges Oil industry activity was depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from excess oil supply pressures, which negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in North America. As a result of these conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook, we recorded total charges of $76.8 million ($50.0 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share, comprised of inventory write-downs and related disposal costs, fixed asset charges, headcount reductions and other charges in 2016. No such charges were incurred in 2017. The inventory write-downs and related disposal costs of $40.5 million include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of certain specific-use and other products, coupled with declines in replacement costs, as well as estimated costs to dispose the respective excess inventory. The fixed asset charges of $20.4 million resulted from the write-down of certain assets related to the reduction of certain aspects of our North American operations within the Global Energy segment, as well as abandonment of certain projects under construction. The carrying value of the corresponding fixed assets was reduced to zero. The employee termination costs of $13.1 million include a reduction in our Global Energy segment’s global workforce to better align its workforce with anticipated activity levels in the near term. As of the end of 2017, the remaining severance liability was minimal. The charges discussed above have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 34 Table of Contents Venezuela related activities Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for the investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016. The conditions within Venezuela driving this decision remained in place during 2016 and 2017. Prior to deconsolidation, we remeasured our Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and the bolivar portion of our Venezuelan operations within Energy operating segments from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to the SIMADI rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. As a result of the ownership structure of our Food & Beverage and Institutional operations in Venezuela, we reflected a portion of the devaluation impact as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon deconsolidation, we recorded a charge to fully write off our intercompany receivables and investment. The total charges during 2015 related to our actions in Venezuela were $289.3 million ($246.8 million after tax). We reflected $11.1 million of the above charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income, resulting in a net charge of $235.7 million or $0.78 per diluted share. We recorded gains due to U.S. dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation of $11.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and $7.8 million ($4.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Gain on sale of business During 2017, we disposed of the Equipment Care business and recorded a gain of $46.1 million ($12.4 million after tax primarily due to non-deductible goodwill), or $0.04 per diluted share, net of working capital adjustments, costs to sell and other transaction expenses. The gain has been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Other We recorded net gains of $1.4 million ($0.7 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, net charges of $33.2 million ($21.1 million after tax) or $0.07 per diluted share, and net charges of $56.3 million ($34.5 million after tax), or $0.11 per diluted share in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, primarily related to litigation related charges and settlements. In 2015, this also included the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our Ecovation business, offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the Champion transaction. These items have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest Expense, net During 2017, in anticipation of U.S. tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years, we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain long-term debt, and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of $21.9 million ($13.6 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share. This charge has been included as a component of interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Operating Income and Operating Income Margin Percent Change (millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Reported GAAP operating income $2,019.8 $1,915.0 $1,561.3 5 % 23 % Special (gains) and charges 40.3 105.5 495.4 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income 2,060.1 2,020.5 2,056.7 2 (2) Effect of foreign currency translation (32.9) (25.2) (119.8) Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income $2,027.2 $1,995.3 $1,936.9 2 % 3 % (percent) 2017 2016 2015 Reported GAAP operating income margin 14.6 % 14.6 % 11.5 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin 14.9 % 15.4 % 15.2 % Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 14.9 % 15.3 % 14.9 % Our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables. Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales. 35 Table of Contents Our reported operating income increased 5% when comparing 2017 to 2016 and increased 23% when comparing 2016 to 2015. Our reported operating income for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2017 adjusted operating income increased 2% when compared to 2016 adjusted operating income and 2016 adjusted fixed currency operating income decreased 2% when compared to 2015 adjusted operating income. As shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2017. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted fixed currency operating income growth for 2016, as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3%. Interest Expense, Net (millions) 2017 2016 2015 Reported GAAP interest expense, net $255.0 $264.6 $243.6 Special (gains) and charges 21.9 - - Non-GAAP adjusted interest expense, net $233.1 $264.6 $243.6 Reported net interest expense totaled $255.0 million, $264.6 million and $243.6 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2017, in anticipation of U.S. tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years, we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain long-term debt, and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of $21.9 million ($13.6 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share. The decrease in our 2017 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increased mix of lower cost Euro interest and lower interest rates on refinanced debt. The increase when comparing 2016 to 2015 was driven primarily by higher weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt. Provision for Income Taxes The following table provides a summary of our tax rate: (percent) 2017 2016 2015 Reported GAAP tax rate 13.7 % 24.4 % 22.8 % Tax rate impact of: The Tax Act 8.8 0.0 0.0 Special gains and charges (0.1) 1.0 (0.4) Discrete tax items 1.4 (0.2) 3.5 Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 23.8 % 25.2 % 25.9 % Our reported tax rate for 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. The enactment of the Tax Act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate. Our 2017 reported tax rate includes $160.9 million of net tax benefits associated with the Tax Act, $6.2 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net tax benefits of $25.3 million associated with discrete tax items. In connection with our analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional net discrete tax benefit of $160.9 million in the period ended December 31, 2017, which includes a $321.0 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the U.S. enacted tax rate and a net expense for the one-time transition tax of $160.1 million. While we are able to make an estimate of the impact of the reduction in the U.S. rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to the Tax Act, including, but not limited to, estimates of assets and liabilities at future dates, our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences. In addition, federal and state tax authorities continue to issue technical guidance which may change the provisional amounts recorded in our financial statements. Special (gains) and charges represent the tax impact of special (gains) and charges, as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of U.S. tax reform of $7.8 million. During 2017, we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of $39.7 million related to excess tax benefits, resulting from the adoption of accounting changes regarding the treatment of tax benefits on share-based compensation. The extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises. In addition, we recorded net discrete expenses of $14.4 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 U.S. federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates, partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters. 36 Table of Contents Our 2016 reported tax rate includes $43.1 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expenses of $3.9 million associated with discrete tax items. Our 2015 reported tax rate includes $105.7 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of $63.3 million associated with discrete tax items. The net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2016 were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 U.S. federal income tax return, partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions. Net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in international jurisdictions. Net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of $20.6 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of $39.0 million for the tax basis in a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary. The change in our adjusted tax rate from 2015 to 2017 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, the Tax Act, other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Net Income Attributable to Ecolab Percent Change (millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Reported GAAP net income attributable to Ecolab $1,508.4 $1,229.6 $1,002.1 23 % 23 % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges, after tax 56.0 62.4 376.9 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) (186.2) 3.9 (63.3) Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab $1,378.2 $1,295.9 $1,315.7 6 % (2) % Diluted EPS Percent Change (dollars) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Reported GAAP diluted EPS $ 5.13 $ 4.14 $ 3.32 24 % 25 % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges 0.19 0.21 1.25 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) (0.63) 0.01 (0.21) Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS $ 4.69 $ 4.37 $ 4.37 7 % 0 % Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding. Currency translation had minimal impact on reported and adjusted diluted EPS comparability across 2017 and 2016, but had a significant unfavorable impact of approximately $0.31 per share for 2016 compared to 2015. 37 Table of Contents SEGMENT PERFORMANCE The non-U.S. dollar functional international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates used by management for 2017. The difference between the fixed currency exchange rates and the actual currency exchange rates is reported as “effect of foreign currency translation” in the following tables. Fixed currency amounts for 2015 also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. All other accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with U.S. GAAP and the accounting policies described in Note 2. Additional information about our reportable segments is included in Note 17.

New business wins, led by demand for our leading product innovation in key platforms, along with appropriate pricing, drove our results. Specialty fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2017, led primarily by new account wins and growth in global quick service accounts, leveraging generally modest industry trends. New business gains remain robust, driven by improved service coverage, new product innovations, additional customer solutions and a continued focus among our customers on food safety as fresh products become more prevalent and require more cleaning. Fixed currency sales increased 7% in 2016. Both quick service and food retail sales growth were solid, led by account growth, new customers and product penetration. Healthcare fixed currency sales increased 42% in 2017 (increase of 3%, when adjusted for the Anios acquisition), with modest growth for Healthcare in North America and Europe.

Continued difficult operating conditions negatively impacted our well stimulation and production businesses due to lower pricing and customer product usage. Sales in our downstream business were flat in 2016. Market challenges in North America drove the reductions from a regional perspective in 2016. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income for Global Energy decreased during both 2017 and 2016 as compared to the prior year. Fixed currency operating income margins also decreased during both comparable periods. Acquisitions had a negative impact on fixed currency operating income in 2017 and minimal impact on the fixed currency operating income in 2016.

Corporate Consistent with our internal management reporting, Corporate amounts in the table on page 38 include intangible asset amortization specifically from the Nalco merger and special (gains) and charges that are not allocated to our reportable segments. Items included within special (gains) and charges are shown in the table on page 33. 42 Table of Contents FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY Financial Position Total assets were $20.0 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to total assets of $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. The increase in assets during 2017 was driven primarily by increased goodwill and intangibles as a result of the Anios and other acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the value of our foreign assets translated into U.S. dollars as of year end 2017. Total liabilities were $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to total liabilities of $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. Total debt was $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2016. See further discussion of our debt activity within the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this MD&A. Our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBIDTA are shown in the following table. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures, which are discussed further in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this MD&A. 2017 2016 2015 (ratio) Net debt to EBITDA 2.4 2.3 2.6 Net debt to adjusted EBITDA 2.4 2.2 2.2 (millions) Total debt $7,322.7 $6,687.0 $6,465.5 Cash 211.4 327.4 92.8 Net debt $7,111.3 $6,359.6 $6,372.7 Net income including non-controlling interest $1,522.4 $1,247.1 $1,017.2 Provision for income taxes 242.4 403.3 300.5 Interest expense, net 255.0 264.6 243.6 Depreciation 585.7 561.0 559.5 Amortization 307.6 289.7 300.0 EBITDA 2,913.1 2,765.7 2,420.8 Special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA 40.3 105.5 495.4 Adjusted EBITDA $2,953.4 $2,871.2 $2,916.2 Cash Flows Operating Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Cash provided by operating activities $2,091.3 $1,939.7 $1,999.8 $151.6 $(60.1) We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2015 to 2017 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable (“working capital”), the combination of which increased $56 million, $35 million and $119 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The cash flow impact across the three years from working capital accounts was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections; timing of purchases and production and usage levels; and volume of purchases and timing of payments. The impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table: Dollar Change (millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Pensions and postretirement plan contributions $144.1 $211.8 $64.9 $(67.7) $146.9 Restructuring payments 39.2 51.6 61.7 (12.4) (10.1) Income tax payments 402.8 359.1 533.1 43.7 (174.0) Interest payments 239.3 267.0 237.2 (27.7) 29.8 43 Table of Contents Investing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Cash used for investing activities $(1,673.2) $(829.5) $(915.8) $(843.7) $86.3 Cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business. Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $870 million, $49 million and $265 million, respectively. Our acquisitions and divestitures across 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth. We continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. Total capital expenditures, including software, were $869 million, $757 million and $815 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Financing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Cash used for financing activities $(522.7) $(868.2) $(1,150.9) $345.5 $282.7 Our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent considerations. Shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. We repurchased a total of $600 million, $740 million, and $755 million of shares in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts include $300 million of shares repurchased each year from 2015 through 2017 through our ASR programs. See Note 10 for further information regarding our ASR programs. Cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity. The impact on financing cash flows of commercial paper and notes payable repayments, long-term debt borrowings and long-term debt repayments, are shown in the following table: Dollar Change (millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable $(43.7) $(606.4) $(312.1) $562.7 $(294.3) Long-term debt borrowings 1,309.4 2,390.0 1,223.7 (1,080.6) 1,166.3 Long-term debt repayments (799.0) (1,569.6) (1,034.7) 770.6 (534.9) In December 2017, we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 11%. This represents the 26th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. We have paid dividends on our common stock for 81 consecutive years. Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year 2017 $0.370 $0.370 $0.370 $0.410 $1.520 2016 0.350 0.350 0.350 0.370 1.420 2015 0.330 0.330 0.330 0.350 1.340 44 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2018, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension contributions, with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong. As of December 31, 2017, we had $211 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $151 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2016, we had $327 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $184 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, we had $26 million of deferred tax liabilities for pre-acquisition foreign earnings associated with the legacy Nalco entities and legacy Champion entities that we intended to repatriate. These liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction. The remaining foreign earnings were repatriated in 2016, reducing the deferred tax liabilities to zero at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017 we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in November 2022. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2017 or 2016. The credit facility supports our $2.0 billion U.S. commercial paper program and $2.0 billion European commercial paper program. Combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year-end, we had no amount outstanding under the European commercial paper program and no amount outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program. Additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines of $660 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs. Most of these lines are used to support global cash pooling structures. Approximately $643 million of these credit lines were available for use as of year-end 2017. Bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees total $198 million and represent commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments. As of December 31, 2017, our short-term borrowing program was rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s. As of December 31, 2017, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Baa1 (stable outlook), respectively. A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs, or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. Should this occur, we could seek additional sources of funding, including issuing additional term notes or bonds. In addition, we have the ability, at our option, to draw upon our $2.0 billion of committed credit facility. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures. A schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2017 are summarized in the following table: Payments Due by Period Less More Than 2-3 4-5 Than (millions) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Notes payable $ 15 $ 15 $ - $ - $ - One-time transition tax 160 13 26 26 95 Long-term debt 7,303 549 696 1,513 4,545 Capital lease obligations 5 1 1 1 2 Operating leases 617 131 211 160 115 Interest* 2,753 242 436 375 1,700 Total $ 10,853 $ 951 $ 1,370 $ 2,075 $ 6,457 *Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year-end 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time transition tax related to enactment of the Tax Act. The expense is primarily related to the one-time transition tax, which is payable over eight years. As discussed further in Note 12, this balance is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the enactment of the Tax Act, as provided by recent SEC guidance. As of December 31, 2017, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $68 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. 45 Table of Contents We do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2018. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $49 million in 2018. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, as discussed further in Note 13, we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary. The joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. These entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Market Risk We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges. We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2017, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $950 million. See Note 8 for further information on our hedging activity. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $322 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items. GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT Energy Markets Approximately 23% of our sales are generated from our Global Energy segment, the results of which, as noted further below, are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets. During 2017, oil industry activity gradually recovered from 2016’s lows, with strong gains in North America drilling activity over the past year and related recovering capital expenditure trends. Demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices rising from their lows in early 2016. Our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the Global Energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. As such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment. Global Economies Approximately half of our sales are outside of the United States. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results. Brexit Referendum On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) government gave formal notice to the European Union (“EU”) to begin the process of negotiating the U.K.’s exit (“Brexit”) from the EU. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The negotiations might also impact various tax reliefs and 46 Table of Contents exemptions that apply to transactions between the U.K. and EU. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. We will continue to monitor the status of tax law changes and tax treaty negotiations at the U.K. and EU. During 2017, net sales of our U.K. operations were approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:  Fixed currency sales  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales  Adjusted cost of sales  Adjusted gross margin  Fixed currency operating income  Fixed currency operating income margin  Adjusted operating income  Adjusted operating income margin  Adjusted fixed currency operating income  Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted tax rate  Adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab  Adjusted diluted EPS  Adjusted interest expense, net We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, interest expense and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges. EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are used as inputs to our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2017. Fixed currency amounts also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar, which was the approximate conversion rate for SIMADI at year end 2015. Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from both the current period and comparable period of the prior year. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts. 47 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The discussion under the heading entitled ""Market Risk"" and “Global Economic and Political Environment” is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.",2023-12-30 21:49:05.848053
31462,ECL,ECOLAB INC.,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled “Results of Operations” of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP. Comparability of Results Adoption of New Accounting Standards On January 1, 2018 we retrospectively adopted the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and the related amendments (“the new revenue standard”). Concurrent with the adoption of the new revenue standard, we reclassified certain costs from selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of sales, to align the cost of providing the service with the recognition of service revenue. The new revenue standard was applied to all periods presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard is recognized at the beginning of the earliest year presented. We also retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-07 Compensation – Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, relating to the presentation of the components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and other post-retirement benefits within the Consolidated Statement of Income (“the new pension standard”). All comparisons and discussion throughout the MD&A reflect the adoption of the new revenue standard and new pension standard. Further information about the adoption of the accounting standards is included in Note 2. Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. Fixed currency amounts during 2018 for Argentina operations are reflected at the Argentine Peso rate established by management at the beginning of the year. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only. Comparability of Reportable Segments Effective in the first quarter of 2018, we established the Colloidal Technologies Group (“CTG”) operating segment. The CTG operating segment has not been aggregated, based on qualitative criteria, and is included in Other. CTG produces and sells colloidal silica, which is comprised of nano-sized particles of silica in water; these products and associated programs are used primarily for binding and polishing applications. CTG was previously recorded in the Water operating segment which is aggregated into the Global Industrial reportable segment. Prior to the sale in November 2017, the Equipment Care operating segment was also included, which provided kitchen repair and maintenance. Additionally, we made immaterial changes to our reportable segments, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments. All comparisons and discussion throughout the MD&A are based on the new operating segment structure effective in the first quarter of 2018. Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. 25 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We achieved accelerating sales and earnings growth through 2018 as we drove new product introductions, new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a generally improved market environment. Increased pricing was implemented to offset significantly higher delivered product costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share leveraged the good operating income growth, benefiting from lower interest expense and taxes, to deliver the year’s double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth. Sales Reported sales increased 6% to $14.7 billion in 2018 from $13.8 billion in 2017. Sales were positively impacted by volume and pricing. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year. Gross Margin Our reported gross margin was 41.2% of sales for 2018, compared to our 2017 reported gross margin of 41.7%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2018 and 2017, our adjusted gross margin was 41.3% in 2018 and 42.0% in 2017. Operating Income Reported operating income was flat at $1.95 billion in 2018, compared to $1.95 billion in 2017. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, increased 5% in 2018. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income also increased 5%. Earnings Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) Reported diluted EPS decreased 5% to $4.88 in 2018 compared to $5.12 in 2017. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the Ecolab Foundation. Special (gains) and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform, restructuring charges, other discrete taxes, acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of Equipment Care. Special (gains) and charges in 2016 were driven primarily by Energy related charges, restructuring charges, other gains and charges and Venezuelan related actions. Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased to $5.25 in 2018 compared to $4.68 in 2017. Balance Sheet We remain committed to maintaining “A” range ratings metrics, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/Baa1 by the major ratings agencies. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates. Net Debt to EBITDA Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was 2.3 and 2.4 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the “Net Debt to EBITDA” table on page 43 for reconciliation information. Cash Flow Cash flow from operating activities was $2.3 billion in 2018 compared to $2.1 billion in 2017. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend 12% in December 2018 to an indicated annual rate of $1.84 per share. The increase represents our 27th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 82nd consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead. 26 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”). Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following: Revenue Recognition On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Committee 606 (ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance on how revenue with customers should be recognized. For additional information on our adoption of this accounting standard, see Note 2. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 840 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract. Our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts, as discussed below. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. The new revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. In addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible. We estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $61 million and $72 million, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $17 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see Note 2. 27 Table of Contents Accrued Liabilities Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. As with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations. We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see Note 15. Actuarially Determined Liabilities Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses. The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table. · The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2018 and 2017, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2018, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 4.34% from 3.70% at year-end 2017. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2018, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 4.29% from 3.66% at year-end 2017. · The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.75% for 2017 and 2018 and 7.25% for 2019. · Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the U.S. pension expenses was 4.03% for 2017, 2018 and 2019. · For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2018, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.25% for pre-65 costs and 11.5% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2028 and remain at those levels thereafter. · In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2018, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2018 projection scale (applied to the RP-2006 mortality table). The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans increased to $539 million as of December 31, 2018 from $527 million as of December 31, 2017 (both before tax), primarily due to the amortization of prior period net actuarial losses. 28 Table of Contents The effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2018, on the December 31, 2018 funded status and 2019 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans: Effect on U.S. Pension Plans Increase in Higher Assumption Recorded 2019 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $59.3 $5.1 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A 5.2 Effect on U.S. Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans Increase in Higher Assumption Recorded 2019 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $3.4 $0.3 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A - Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information. See Note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations. Self Insurance Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. Restructuring Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. These restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets. Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our restructuring liability balance was $79 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3. 29 Table of Contents Income Taxes Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Tax Act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI), the base erosion anti abuse tax (BEAT) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII). We initially recorded an estimate of the one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $160 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of $66 million, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance, finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 U.S. federal tax return and final balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax. As of December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In January 2018, accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy to either treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the ""period cost method"") or factor such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (the ""deferred method""). We have elected the period cost method and have considered the estimated 2018 GILTI impact in our 2018 tax expense. Additionally, proposed regulations were released during 2018. Certain of the proposed regulations may be subject to challenge; therefore, we recorded tax expense based on our interpretation of the changes in law affected by the Tax Act and not the proposed regulations. If the proposed regulations become final, we will record the impact at that time. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. This expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. In the event there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period. Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, U.S. deferred income taxes had not been provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings. As part of the Tax Act, we recorded a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years. We will continue to assert permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates, and if our policy changes we would record applicable taxes. Uncertain Tax Positions A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns (Ecolab and Nalco) through 2014 and the years 2015 and 2016 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. 30 Table of Contents The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. The majority of our tax reserves are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $50 million and $62 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information on income taxes see Note 12. Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets We periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $7.1 billion and $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships. Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer base acquired in our recent Nalco and Champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. Our customer retention rate and history of maintaining long-term relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future. Additionally, other less certain post-acquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions, induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships. If our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets. In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets We had total goodwill of $7.1 billion and $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments. For our 2018 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our eleven reporting units through a quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. Our goodwill impairment assessment for 2018 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin. We will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the years presented. As part of the Nalco merger, we added the “Nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2018. Based on this testing, no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2018 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2018. 31 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Percent Change (millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Product and equipment sales $12,128.6 $11,431.8 $10,904.1 Service and lease sales 2,539.6 2,404.1 2,247.7 Reported GAAP net sales $14,668.2 $13,835.9 $13,151.8 6 % 5 % Effect of foreign currency translation 378.1 394.1 391.7 Non-GAAP fixed currency sales $15,046.3 $14,230.0 $13,543.5 6 % 5 % The percentage components of the year-over-year sales change are shown below: (percent) 2018 2017 Volume 4% 3% Price changes 2 1 Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change 6 4 Acquisitions & divestitures 0 1 Fixed currency sales change 6 5 Foreign currency translation 0 0 Reported GAAP net sales change 6% 5% Cost of Sales (“COS”) and Gross Profit Margin (“Gross Margin”) 2018 2017 2016 Gross Gross Gross (millions/percent) COS Margin COS Margin COS Margin Product and equipment cost of sales $7,078.5 $6,576.9 $6,153.3 Service and lease cost of sales 1,547.4 1,487.3 1,380.6 Reported GAAP COS and gross margin $8,625.9 41.2 % $8,064.2 41.7 % $7,533.9 42.7 % Special (gains) and charges 9.3 0.1 44.0 0.3 66.0 0.5 Non-GAAP adjusted COS and gross margin $8,616.6 41.3 % $8,020.2 42.0 % $7,467.9 43.2 % Our COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table. Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales. Our reported gross margin was 41.2%, 41.7%, and 42.7% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our 2018, 2017 and 2016 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $9.3 million, $44.0 million, and $66.0 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the “Special (Gains) and Charges” table on page 33. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2018 adjusted gross margin was 41.3% compared against a 2017 adjusted gross margin of 42.0%. The decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs more than offsetting the impact from increased pricing and cost savings. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 42.0% and 43.2% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs and an increase in Global Energy (which on average has a lower gross margin), which more than offset pricing and cost savings. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”) (percent) 2018 2017 2016 SG&A Ratio 27.1 % 27.6 % 28.2 % The decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2018 against 2017 was driven primarily by sales volume leverage, the 2017 restructuring efforts and cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business. The decreased SG&A ratio comparing 2017 against 2016 was driven primarily by sales volume leverage and cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business and the impact of acquisitions. 32 Table of Contents Special (Gains) and Charges Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income included the following items: (millions) 2018 2017 2016 Cost of sales Restructuring activities $12.1 $4.6 $(0.4) Acquisition and integration activities (0.6) 13.2 - Energy related charges - - 62.6 Other (2.2) 26.2 3.8 Subtotal 9.3 44.0 66.0 Special (gains) and charges Restructuring activities 89.4 39.9 (8.7) Acquisition and integration activities 8.8 15.4 8.6 Gain on sale of business - (46.1) - Energy related charges - - 14.2 Venezuela related gain - (11.5) (7.8) Other 28.5 (1.4) 33.2 Subtotal 126.7 (3.7) 39.5 Operating income subtotal 136.0 40.3 105.5 Interest expense, net 0.3 21.9 - Total special (gains) and charges $136.3 $62.2 $105.5 For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting. Restructuring Activities Restructuring activities are comprised of actions taken in 2018 related to Accelerate 2020 (described further below) and other actions taken in years prior to 2018. These activities have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3. Accelerate 2020 During the third quarter of 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan Accelerate 2020 (“the Plan”), to leverage technology and systems investments and organizational changes. Subsequent to year-end, we raised our goals for the Plan to simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by leveraging technology and structural improvements. We expect the expanded restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2020, with anticipated costs of $260 million ($190 million after tax), or $0.65 per diluted share, over this period of time. Costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken. The restructuring actions are expected to result in approximately $325 million of annual cost savings by 2021. We recorded restructuring charges of $104.6 million ($79.6 million after tax), or $0.27 per diluted share in 2018. The liability related to this Plan was $63.9 million as of the end of the year. Other Restructuring Activities Prior to 2018, we engaged in a number of restructuring plans. During 2017, we commenced restructuring and other cost-saving actions in order to streamline our operations. These actions include a reduction of our global workforce, as well as asset disposals and lease terminations. Actions were substantially completed in 2017. We also have restructuring plans that commenced prior to 2016. During 2018, net restructuring gains related to prior year plans were $3.1 million ($2.4 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. During 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $44.5 million ($32.3 million after tax) or $0.11 per diluted share. During 2016, we recorded restructuring gains of $9.1 million ($10.8 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share. The restructuring liability balance for all plans commencing prior to 2018 was $14.9 million and $41.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. The majority of pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2018 related to restructuring plans commencing prior to 2018 were $22.7 million. 33 Table of Contents Acquisition and integration related costs Acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018 include $8.8 million ($6.1 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. Charges are primarily related to Laboratoires Anios (“Anios”) integration costs, advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration gain reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018 relate to changes in estimates related to an early lease exit. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense in 2018. During 2017, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income included $15.4 million ($9.9 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share of acquisition costs, advisory and legal fees, and integration charges for the Anios and Swisher acquisitions. Acquisition and integration costs reported in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2017 included $13.2 million ($8.6 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share related primarily to disposal of excess inventory upon the closure of Swisher plants, accelerated rent expense, and amounts related to recognition of fair value step-up in the Anios inventory. During 2016, we incurred acquisition and integration charges of $8.6 million ($5.4 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share primarily related to the Swisher acquisition. Further information related to our acquisitions is included in Note 4. Gain on sale of business During 2017, we disposed of the Equipment Care business and recorded a gain of $46.1 million ($12.4 million after tax primarily due to non-deductible goodwill), or $0.04 per diluted share, net of working capital adjustments, costs to sell and other transaction expenses. The gain has been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Energy related charges In 2016, excess oil supply pressure negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, which directly impacted our operations and business outlook. Energy related charges reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2016 include $62.6 million ($40.7 million after tax), or $0.14 per diluted share, comprised of inventory write-downs due to projects under construction. Energy related charges reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2016 include $14.2 million ($9.3 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, related to headcount reductions and other charges. No such charges occurred in 2017 or 2018. Venezuela related activities Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries. We recorded gains due to U.S. dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation of $11.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and $7.8 million ($4.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2017 and 2016, respectively. No such gains occurred in 2018. Other During 2018, we recorded other special charges of $28.5 million ($21.5 million after tax) or $0.07 per diluted share, which primarily consisted of a $25.0 million ($18.9 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share, a commitment to the Ecolab Foundation. Other charges, primarily litigation related charges, were minimal and have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Other special gains reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018 of $2.2 million ($1.7 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share, relate to changes in estimates for an inventory LIFO reserve. During 2017, we recorded other charges of $24.8 million ($19.0 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, primarily related to fixed asset impairments, a Global Energy vendor contract termination and litigation related charges. These charges have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2016, we recorded other charges of $37.0 million ($22.7 million after tax), or $0.08 per diluted share, primarily related to fixed asset impairments and litigation related charges and settlements. These charges have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest expense, net During 2017, in anticipation of U.S. tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years, we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain long-term debt, and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of $21.9 million ($13.6 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share. This charge has been included as a component of interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 34 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Income Margin Percent Change (millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Reported GAAP operating income $1,947.0 $1,950.1 $1,870.2 (0) % 4 % Special (gains) and charges 136.0 40.3 105.5 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income 2,083.0 1,990.4 1,975.7 5 1 Effect of foreign currency translation 60.7 52.9 51.3 Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income $2,143.7 $2,043.3 $2,027.0 5 % 1 % (percent) 2018 2017 2016 Reported GAAP operating income margin 13.3 % 14.1 % 14.2 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin 14.2 % 14.4 % 15.0 % Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 14.2 % 14.4 % 15.0 % Our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables. Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales. Our reported operating income remained flat when comparing 2018 to 2017 and increased 4% when comparing 2017 to 2016. Our reported operating income for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2018 adjusted operating income increased 5% when compared to 2017 adjusted operating income and 2017 adjusted operating income increased 1% when compared to 2016 adjusted operating income. As shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2018 and 2017. Other (Income) Expense Other (income) expense relates to the income from the non-service components of pension cost which were $79.9 million, $67.3 million and $43.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in income is primarily due to expected returns on increased pension assets. Interest Expense, Net (millions) 2018 2017 2016 Reported GAAP interest expense, net $222.3 $255.0 $264.6 Special (gains) and charges 0.3 21.9 - Non-GAAP adjusted interest expense, net $222.0 $233.1 $264.6 Reported net interest expense totaled $222.3 million, $255.0 million and $264.6 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. During 2018, in conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense. During 2017, in anticipation of U.S. tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years, we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain long-term debt, and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of $21.9 million ($13.6 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share. The decrease in our 2018 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2017 was driven primarily by lower interest rates on debt. The decrease in our 2017 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increased mix of lower cost Euro interest and lower interest rates on refinanced debt. 35 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The following table provides a summary of our tax rate: (percent) 2018 2017 2016 Reported GAAP tax rate 20.2 % 13.8 % 24.4 % Tax rate impact of: The Tax Act (3.4) 8.7 0.0 Special (gains) and charges 0.3 (0.1) 1.0 Discrete tax items 3.2 1.4 (0.2) Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 20.3 % 23.8 % 25.2 % Our reported tax rate was 20.2%, 13.8%, and 24.4% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. The enactment of the Tax Act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate. We recognized total net expense related to discrete tax items of $4.7 million during 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, we filed U.S. federal tax returns which resulted in favorable adjustments of $39.9 million related to changes in estimates and an IRS approved method change. U.S. tax reform (as described further below) resulted in $66.0 million expense for 2018. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $28.1 million in 2018. The extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in reserves in non-U.S. jurisdictions, audit settlements and both international and U.S. changes in estimates. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Tax Act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI), the base erosion anti abuse tax (BEAT) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII). In January 2018, accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the ""period cost method"") or factor such amounts into a company’s measurement of our deferred taxes (the ""deferred method""). We have elected the period cost method and considered the estimated 2018 GILTI impact in our 2018 tax expense. We initially recorded an estimate of the one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $160.1 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of $66.0 million associated with finalizing our accounting for the Tax Act, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance during the year and finalization of estimates related to asset balances and calculation of foreign earnings and profits. Our 2017 reported rate also includes a $319.0 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the U.S. enacted tax rate of 21%. Our 2017 reported tax rate also includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges, as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of U.S. tax reform of $7.8 million. During 2017, we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of $39.7 million related to excess tax benefits. In addition, we recorded net discrete expenses of $14.4 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 U.S. federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates, partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters. Our 2016 reported tax rate includes $43.1 million of net tax benefits on special (gains) and charges and net expenses of $3.9 million associated with discrete tax items. The net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2016 were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 U.S. federal income tax return, partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions. Net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in international jurisdictions. The change in our adjusted tax rate from 2016 to 2018 was primarily driven by enactment of the Tax Act, global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, the Tax Act, other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix. 36 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Ecolab Percent Change (millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Reported GAAP net income attributable to Ecolab $1,429.1 $1,504.6 $1,229.0 (5) % 22 % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges, after tax 102.8 56.0 62.4 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) 4.7 (184.2) 3.9 Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab $1,536.6 $1,376.4 $1,295.3 12 % 6 % Diluted EPS Percent Change (dollars) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Reported GAAP diluted EPS $ 4.88 $ 5.12 $ 4.14 (5) % 24 % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges 0.35 0.19 0.21 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) 0.02 (0.63) 0.01 Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS $ 5.25 $ 4.68 $ 4.37 12 % 7 % Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.

Corporate Consistent with our internal management reporting, Corporate expense amounts in the table on page 38 include intangible asset amortization specifically from the Nalco merger and special (gains) and charges that are not allocated to our reportable segments. Items included within special (gains) and charges are shown in the table on page 33. 42 Table of Contents FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY Financial Position Total assets were $20.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, compared to total assets of $20.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. Total liabilities were $12.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, compared to total liabilities of $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. Total debt was $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. See further discussion of our debt activity within the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this MD&A. Our net debt to EBITDA is shown in the following table. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure discussed further in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this MD&A. 2018 2017 2016 (ratio) Net debt to EBITDA 2.3 2.4 2.3 (millions) Total debt $7,045.2 $7,322.7 $6,687.0 Cash 114.7 211.4 327.4 Net debt $6,930.5 $7,111.3 $6,359.6 Net income including non-controlling interest $1,440.3 $1,518.6 $1,246.5 Provision for income taxes 364.3 243.8 402.9 Interest expense, net 222.3 255.0 264.6 Depreciation 621.3 585.7 561.0 Amortization 317.0 307.6 289.7 EBITDA $2,965.2 $2,910.7 $2,764.7 Cash Flows Operating Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Cash provided by operating activities $2,277.7 $2,091.3 $1,939.7 $186.4 $151.6 We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2016 to 2018 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable (“working capital”), the combination of which increased $192 million, $56 million and $35 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The cash flow impact across the three years from working capital accounts was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections; timing of purchases and production and usage levels; and volume of purchases and timing of payments. The impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table: Dollar Change (millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Pensions and postretirement plan contributions $60.0 $144.1 $211.8 $(84.1) $(67.7) Restructuring payments 57.9 39.2 51.6 18.7 (12.4) Income tax payments 395.2 402.8 359.1 (7.6) 43.7 Interest payments 206.4 239.3 267.0 (32.9) (27.7) 43 Table of Contents Investing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Cash used for investing activities $(1,030.0) $(1,727.0) $(773.6) $697.0 $(953.4) Cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business. Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $221 million, $870 million and $49 million, respectively. Our acquisitions and divestitures across 2018, 2017 and 2016 are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth. We continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. Total capital expenditures were $847 million, $869 million and $757 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Financing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Cash used for financing activities $(1,172.7) $(522.7) $(868.2) $(650.0) $345.5 Our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent considerations. Shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. We repurchased a total of $562 million, $600 million, and $740 million of shares in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts include $300 million of shares repurchased in 2017 and 2016 through our Accelerated Stock Repurchase (“ASR”) programs. See Note 10 for further information regarding our ASR programs. The impact on financing cash flows of commercial paper and notes payable repayments, long-term debt borrowings and long-term debt repayments, are shown in the following table: Dollar Change (millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Net issuances of commercial paper and notes payable $341.8 $(43.7) $(606.4) $385.5 $562.7 Long-term debt borrowings - 1,309.4 2,390.0 (1,309.4) (1,080.6) Long-term debt repayments (551.6) (799.0) (1,569.6) 247.4 770.6 In December 2018, we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 12%. This represents the 27th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. We have paid dividends on our common stock for 82 consecutive years. Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year 2018 $0.410 $0.410 $0.410 $0.460 $1.690 2017 0.370 0.370 0.370 0.410 1.520 2016 0.350 0.350 0.350 0.370 1.420 44 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong. As of December 31, 2018, we had $115 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, substantially all of which was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, we had $211 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $151 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2018 we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in November 2022. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. The maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our U.S. commercial paper program and our Euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year-end, we had $141.4 million (€125.0 million) of commercial paper outstanding under the Euro commercial paper program and $24.0 million outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. As of December 31, 2018, both programs were rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s, P-2 by Moody’s and F-2 by Fitch. Additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. These credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. We have $150 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments. As of December 31, 2018, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch both rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at Baa1 (stable outlook). A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs, or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures. A schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2018 are summarized in the following table: Payments Due by Period Less More Than 2-3 4-5 Than (millions) Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Notes payable $ 177 $ 177 $ - $ - $ - One-time transition tax 156 11 25 26 94 Long-term debt 6,701 400 1,318 1,145 3,838 Capital lease obligations 2 1 1 - - Operating leases 634 172 249 109 104 Interest* 2,470 222 424 303 1,521 Total $ 10,140 $ 983 $ 2,017 $ 1,583 $ 5,557 *Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year-end 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $50 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2019. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $48 million in 2019. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles. 45 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, as discussed further in Note 13, we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary. The joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. These entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Market Risk We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges. We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2018, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $400 million. See Note 8 for further information on our hedging activity. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $258 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items. GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT Energy Markets Approximately 23% of our sales are generated from our Global Energy segment, the results of which, as noted further below, are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets. During 2018, oil industry drilling and production activity showed improved volumes over 2017, led by strong gains in North America drilling and production activity over the past year and related recovering capital expenditure trends, while international activity remained soft. Demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices well above their lows in early 2016. Our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the Global Energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. As such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment. Global Economies Approximately half of our sales are outside of the United States. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results. Argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and increasing borrowing rates. Argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. During 2018, sales in Argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. Assets held in Argentina at the end of 2018 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets. 46 Table of Contents Brexit Referendum On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) government gave formal notice to the European Union (“EU”) to begin the process of negotiating the U.K.’s exit (“Brexit”) from the EU. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The negotiations might also impact various tax reliefs and exemptions that apply to transactions between the U.K. and EU. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. We will continue to monitor the status of tax law changes and tax treaty negotiations at the U.K. and EU. During 2018, net sales of our U.K. operations were approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Acquisitions Subsequent to year-end, we closed on the acquisition of Bioquell PLC, a leading provider of hydrogen peroxide vapor bio-decontamination systems and services for the life sciences and healthcare industries and acquired Lobster Ink, a leading provider of end-to-end online customer training solutions. We also entered into various purchase and sale agreements which are expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. None of the agreements are significant to the consolidated financial statements, individually or in the aggregate. Upstream Energy Spin-off Ecolab intends to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by Ecolab’s Board of Directors and any regulatory approvals, a plan to separate and spin-off the Upstream group of Ecolab’s Global Energy segment (the Upstream Business) through a series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the Spin-off). Under the plan, if effectuated, Ecolab’s shareholders would own 100% of the common stock of a new corporation that owns the Upstream Business. The Spin-off is expected to be completed in 2020 and is intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to Ecolab shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In anticipation of and to facilitate the Spin-off, Ecolab is currently planning for the internal separation of the Upstream Business through a series of transactions that are intended to be tax-efficient from a U.S. federal income tax perspective. The Spin-off is expected to consist of two phases: (i) a series of internal transactions undertaken by Ecolab and its direct and indirect subsidiaries to separate the Upstream Business from Ecolab’s other businesses, including multiple distributions intended to qualify as tax-free distributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (collectively, the Internal Separations), followed by (ii) an external distribution by Ecolab of the common stock of a newly-formed corporation owning the Upstream Business to current Ecolab shareholders owning Ecolab shares in a distribution that is intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Separations are currently expected to occur in the United States and in (or involving entities domiciled in) various other jurisdictions, including (but not limited to) Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Jersey, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Switzerland. In particular, the Ecolab subsidiaries (which shall also include any of their successors and transferees) that are anticipated to be distributing corporations in connection with the Internal Separations include: Ecolab Lux 9 S.à r.l., Ecolab NL 11 B.V., Nalco Overseas Holding B.V., Nalco Holding B.V., Ecolab Lux 11 S.à r.l., Ecolab Lux 10 S.à r.l., Ecolab U.S. 2 Inc., Ecolab Lux 7 S.à r.l., Ecolab CH 2 GmbH, Ecolab NL 3 B.V., Ecolab Lux 1 S.à r.l., Ecolab Lux 2 S.à r.l., Nalco Saudi Co. Ltd., Nalco Gulf Limited, Nalco Manufacturing Ltd., Ecolab Pte. Ltd., Ecolab USA Inc., Nalco Holding Company and Nalco U.S. 2 Inc. In addition, certain Ecolab subsidiaries (or their respective successors and transferees) listed on Exhibit (21.1) may also be distributing corporations in connection with the Internal Separations. 47 Table of Contents NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:  Fixed currency sales  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales  Adjusted cost of sales  Adjusted gross margin  Fixed currency operating income  Fixed currency operating income margin  Adjusted operating income  Adjusted operating income margin  Adjusted fixed currency operating income  Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  Adjusted interest expense, net  EBITDA  Adjusted tax rate  Adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab  Adjusted diluted EPS We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, interest expense and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges. EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2018. Fixed currency amounts during 2018 for Argentina operations are reflected at the Argentine Peso rate established by management at the beginning of the year. Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts.

31462,ECL,ECOLAB INC.,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.​The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.​The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled “Results of Operations” of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP.​Comparability of Results​Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates​Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.​Comparability of Reportable Segments​We made immaterial changes to our reportable segments, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments. All comparisons and discussion throughout the MD&A reflect these changes.​Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures​Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture.​25 Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY​We achieved improved sales and strong earnings growth in 2019 as we drove new product introductions, new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a generally steady market environment. Increased pricing was achieved to more than offset unfavorable sales mix. Along with higher other income and lower interest expense, adjusted diluted earnings per share leveraged the good operating income growth and delivered the year’s double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth. ​Sales​Reported sales increased 2% to $14.9 billion in 2019 from $14.7 billion in 2018. Sales were positively impacted by pricing. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 4% compared to the prior year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 3% compared to the prior year.​Gross Margin​Our reported gross margin was 41.5% of sales for 2019, compared to our 2018 reported gross margin of 41.2%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2019 and 2018, our adjusted gross margin was 41.7% in 2019 and 41.3% in 2018. ​Operating Income ​Reported operating income increased 3% to $2.01 billion in 2019, compared to $1.95 billion in 2018. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, increased 9% in 2019. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 11% in 2019. ​Earnings Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) ​Reported diluted EPS increased 9% to $5.33 in 2019 compared to $4.88 in 2018. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, the ChampionX separation charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges, litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the Ecolab Foundation. Special (gains) and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform, restructuring charges, other discrete taxes, acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of Equipment Care. Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased 11% to $5.82 in 2019 compared to $5.25 in 2018. ​Balance Sheet​We remain committed to maintaining “A” range ratings metrics, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/Baa1/A- by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.​Net Debt to EBITDA​Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was 2.0 and 2.3 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the “Net Debt to EBITDA” table on page 43 for reconciliation information.​Cash Flow​Cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion in 2019 compared to $2.3 billion in 2018. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. ​Dividends ​We increased our quarterly cash dividend 2% in December 2019 to an indicated annual rate of $1.88 per share. The increase represents our 28th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 83rd consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.​26 Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES​Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”).​Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.​Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:​Revenue Recognition​Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 842 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.​Our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see discussion below.​The revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. For additional information on revenue recognition, see Note 17.​Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities​Allowances for Doubtful Accounts​We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. In addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible. We estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates.​Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $62 million and $61 million, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $18 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.1% in each of the years 2019, 2018 and 2017. We believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see Note 2.​27 Table of ContentsAccrued Liabilities​Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.​We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see Note 15.​Actuarially Determined Liabilities​Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans​The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.​The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.​●The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2019 and 2018, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2019, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 3.20% from 4.34% at year-end 2018. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2019, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 3.16% from 4.29% at year-end 2018.​●The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.25% for 2020 and 2019 and 7.75% for 2018.​●Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the U.S. pension expenses was 4.03% for 2019, 2018 and 2017. ​●For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2019, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.00% for pre-65 costs and 10.75% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2028 and remain at those levels thereafter.​●In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2019, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2019 projection scale (applied to the Pri-2012 mortality table).​The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans increased to $632 million as of December 31, 2019 from $539 million as of December 31, 2018 (both before tax), primarily due to current year net actuarial losses. ​28 Table of ContentsThe effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2019, on the December 31, 2019 defined benefit obligation and 2020 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans. Expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Effect on U.S. Pension Plans​​​​Increase in​Higher​​Assumption​Recorded​2020(millions)​Change​Obligation​ExpenseDiscount rate -0.25 pts​​ $74.1​​​ $5.3​Expected return on assets -0.25 pts​​N/A​​​ 5.3​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Effect on U.S. Postretirement​​Health Care Benefits Plans​​​​Increase in​Higher​​Assumption​Recorded​2020(millions)​Change​Obligation​ExpenseDiscount rate -0.25 pts ​ $4.1​ ​ $0.2​Expected return on assets -0.25 pts​ N/A​​​ -​​Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.​See Note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.​Self-Insurance​Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. ​Restructuring​Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. These restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets. Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our restructuring liability balance was $112 million and $79 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3.​29 Table of ContentsIncome Taxes​Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.​On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Tax Act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI), the base erosion anti abuse tax (BEAT) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII). ​We recorded an estimate of the one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $160 million and in 2018 and 2019 we recorded additional discrete expense of $66 million and benefit of $3.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance in both years, the finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 and 2018 U.S. federal tax return and the finalization of the balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax. We have completed our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.​Additionally, proposed regulations were released during 2019. Certain of the proposed regulations may be subject to challenge; therefore, we recorded tax expense based on our interpretation of the changes in law affected by the Tax Act and not the proposed regulations. If the proposed regulations become final, we will record the impact at that time.​Effective Income Tax Rate​Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. This expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. In the event there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period.​Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.​Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances​Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements.​During 2019, due to the adoption of the new lease standard and the recording of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, we recorded related deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, respectively. ​Uncertain Tax Positions​A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.​The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. Tax reserves are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $28 million and $50 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information on income taxes see Note 12.​30 Table of ContentsLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill​Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets​We review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $7.0 billion and $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for impairment and when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. ​We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.​Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our Nalco and Champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. If our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets.​In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.​Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets​We had total goodwill of $7.3 billion and $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.​For our 2019 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our reporting units using a two-step quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The first step of the analysis involved determining the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and comparing them to the respective carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. Our goodwill impairment assessment for 2019 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin. We assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may not be recoverable. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the years presented.​As part of the Nalco merger, we added the “Nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2019. Our Nalco trade name assessment for 2019 indicated the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin. We assess the need to test the Nalco trade name for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name in any of the years presented. ​31 Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​​​2019​2018​2017​2019​2018Product and equipment sales​​​​ $12,238.9​ ​ $12,128.6​ ​ $11,431.8​ ​​​​​Service and lease sales​​​​ 2,667.4​​​ 2,539.6​​​ 2,404.1​​​​​​​Reported GAAP net sales​​​​ $14,906.3​​​ $14,668.2​​​ $13,835.9​​ 2% ​ 6%Effect of foreign currency translation​​​ 140.6​ (137.5)​​ (37.8)​​​​​​​Non-GAAP fixed currency sales​​​​ $15,046.9​​​ $14,530.7​​​ $13,798.1​​ 4% ​ 5%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​The percentage components of the year-over-year sales change are shown below:​​​​​​(percent) 2019​2018Volume 0%​4%Price changes 2​2Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change 3​6Acquisitions & divestitures 1​0Fixed currency sales change 4​6Foreign currency translation (2)​0Reported GAAP net sales change 2%​6%​Amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Cost of Sales (“COS”) and Gross Profit Margin (“Gross Margin”)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2019​2018​2017​​​​ Gross​​​​ Gross​​​​ Gross(millions/percent)​COS​​Margin​​COS​​Margin​​COS​​MarginProduct and equipment cost of sales​ $7,106.4​​​​​​ $7,078.5​​​​​​ $6,576.9​​​​Service and lease cost of sales​ 1,617.0​​​​​​ 1,547.4​​​​​​ 1,487.3​​​​Reported GAAP COS and gross margin​ $8,723.4​​41.5% ​​ $8,625.9​​41.2%​​ $8,064.2​​41.7%Special (gains) and charges​ 38.5​​ 0.2​​​ 9.3​​ 0.1​​ 44.0​ 0.3​Non-GAAP adjusted COS and gross margin​ $8,684.9​​ 41.7% ​​ $8,616.6​​41.3%​​ $8,020.2​​42.0%​Our COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table. Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales.​Our reported gross margin was 41.5%, 41.2%, and 41.7% for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our 2019, 2018 and 2017 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $38.5 million, $9.3 million, and $44.0 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the “Special (Gains) and Charges” table on page 33.​Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2019 adjusted gross margin was 41.7% compared against a 2018 adjusted gross margin of 41.3%. The increase was driven primarily by pricing, which more than offset unfavorable sales mix.​Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 41.3% and 42.0% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs more than offsetting the impact from increased pricing and cost savings.​Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2019​2018​2017SG&A Ratio 26.5% ​27.1% ​27.6%​The decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2019 against 2018 and comparing 2018 against 2017 were driven primarily by sales leverage, restructuring efforts and cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business.​32 Table of ContentsSpecial (Gains) and Charges​Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income included the following items:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) ​2019​2018​2017Cost of sales​​​​​​​​​​​​​Restructuring activities​​ $20.4​​ $12.1​ $4.6​Acquisition and integration activities​​​ 7.6​​​ (0.6)​​​ 13.2​Other​​​ 10.5​​​ (2.2)​​​ 26.2​Cost of sales subtotal​​ 38.5​​ 9.3​ 44.0​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges​​​​​​​​​​​​​Restructuring activities​​ 116.8​​ 89.4​ 39.9​ChampionX separation​​​ 77.3​​​ -​​​ -​Acquisition and integration activities​​​ 5.6​​​ 8.8​​​ 15.4​Gain on sale of business​​​ -​​​ -​​​ (46.1)​Venezuela related gain​​​ -​​​ -​​​ (11.5)​Other​​ 11.9​​ 28.5​ (1.4)​Special (gains) and charges subtotal​​ 211.6​​ 126.7​ (3.7)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income subtotal​​​ 250.1​​​ 136.0​​​ 40.3​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Interest expense, net​​​ 0.2​​​ 0.3​​​ 21.9​Other (income) expense​​​ 9.5​​​ -​​​ -​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total special (gains) and charges​​​ $259.8​​​ $136.3​​​ $62.2​​For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.​Restructuring Activities​Restructuring activities are primarily related to Accelerate 2020 (described below). These activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.​Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.​Accelerate 2020​During the third quarter of 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan Accelerate 2020 (“the Plan”), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. In 2019, we raised our goals for the Plan to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilitates and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. We expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2020, with total anticipated costs of $260 million ($200 million after tax), or an estimated $0.68 per diluted share, over this period of time. Costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken. ​We recorded restructuring charges of $136.6 million ($104.4 million after tax) or $0.36 per diluted share in 2019. Of these expenses, $2.0 million ($1.5 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share is recorded in other (income) expense. The liability related to the Plan was $104.0 million as of the end of the year. We have recorded $241.2 million ($184.0 million after tax), or $0.63 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the Plan. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.​The Plan has delivered $125 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $325 million by 2021. ​​33 Table of ContentsOther Restructuring Activities​During 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $4.1 million ($3.3 million after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, related to an immaterial restructuring plan. The charges are comprised of severance, facility closure costs, including asset disposals, and consulting fees. ​Prior to 2018, we engaged in a number of restructuring plans. During 2017, we commenced restructuring and other cost-saving actions in order to streamline operations. These actions include a reduction of our global workforce, as well as asset disposals and lease terminations. Actions were substantially completed in 2017. We also have restructuring plans that commenced prior to 2016. During 2019, net restructuring gains related to prior year plans were $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share. During 2018, net restructuring gains related to prior year plans were $3.1 million ($2.4 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. The gains recorded were due to finalizing estimates upon completion of projects. During 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $44.5 million ($32.3 million after tax) or $0.11 per diluted share. ​The restructuring liability balance for all plans excluding Accelerate 2020 was $7.7 million and $14.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2019 related to these plans were $8.3 million.​ChampionX Separation​On December 18, 2019, we entered into definitive agreements with ChampionX and Apergy pursuant to which we will separate the Upstream Energy business of our Global Energy segment and combine it with Apergy in a tax-efficient reverse Morris Trust transaction. During 2019, the charges associated with the separation reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income include $77.3 million ($65.8 million after tax) or $0.22 per diluted share. The charges are primarily related to professional fees to support the separation. ChampionX separation costs reported in other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2019 include $7.5 million ($5.7 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share related to pension curtailments and settlements due to the separation. ​Acquisition and integration related costs​Acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2019 include $5.6 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. Charges are primarily related to Bioquell PLC (“Bioquell”) and Laboratoires Anios (“Anios”) acquisitions and consist of integration costs, advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2019 include $7.6 million ($5.6 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and are related to recognition of fair value step-up in the Bioquell inventory and facility closure costs. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.2 million ($0.1 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense in 2019. ​During 2018, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income included $8.8 million ($6.1 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, of charges primarily related to Anios integration costs, advisory and legal fees. The acquisition and integration gains reported in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018 related to changes in estimates related to an early lease exist. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense in 2018. ​During 2017, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income included $15.4 million ($9.9 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, of acquisition costs, advisory and legal fees, and integration charges for the Anios and Swisher acquisitions. Acquisition and integration costs reported in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2017 included $13.2 million ($8.6 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, which related primarily to disposal of excess inventory upon the closure of Swisher plants, accelerated rent expense, and amounts related to recognition of fair value step-up in the Anios inventory. Further information related to our acquisitions is included in Note 4.​Gain on sale of business​During 2017, we disposed of the Equipment Care business and recorded a gain of $46.1 million ($12.4 million after tax primarily due to non-deductible goodwill), or $0.04 per diluted share, net of working capital adjustments, costs to sell and other transaction expenses. The gain was included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income.​Venezuela related activities​Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries. We recorded gains due to U.S. dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation of $11.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2017. No such gains occurred in 2018 and 2019.​34 Table of ContentsOther​During 2019, we recorded other special charges of $11.9 million ($7.5 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, which primarily related to legal charges partially offset by a litigation settlement. Other special charges reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2019 of $10.5 million ($7.1 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, relate to a Healthcare product recall in Europe.​During 2018, we recorded other special charges of $28.5 million ($21.5 million after tax), or $0.07 per diluted share, which primarily consisted of a $25.0 million ($18.9 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, commitment to the Ecolab Foundation. Other charges, primarily litigation related charges, were minimal and have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Other special gains reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018 of $2.2 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, relate to changes in estimates for an inventory LIFO reserve. ​During 2017, we recorded other charges of $24.8 million ($19.0 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, primarily related to fixed asset impairments, a Global Energy vendor contract termination and litigation related charges. These charges have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. ​Other (Income) Expense​During 2019, the Company recorded other expense of $9.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share related to pension curtailments and settlements for ChampionX separation and Accelerate 2020, respectively, as discussed further above. These charges have been included as a component of other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.​Interest expense, net​During 2019 and 2018, an immaterial amount of interest expense was recorded due to acquisition and integration costs.​During 2017, in anticipation of U.S. tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years, we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain long-term debt, and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of $21.9 million ($13.6 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share. This charge has been included as a component of interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income.​Operating Income and Operating Income Margin​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​ ​​​Percent Change​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2019 2018 2017​​​2019​2018Reported GAAP operating income​​ $2,013.8​​​ $1,947.0​​​ $1,950.1​​​​​ 3% ​​ (0)% Special (gains) and charges ​ 250.1​​​ 136.0​​​ 40.3​​​​ ​​​ ​​Non-GAAP adjusted operating income ​ 2,263.9​​​ 2,083.0​​​ 1,990.4​​​​ 9​​ 5​Effect of foreign currency translation ​ 20.4​​​ (20.4)​​​ (12.1)​​​​ ​​​ ​​Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income​​ $2,284.3​​​ $2,062.6​​​ $1,978.3​​​​​ 11% ​​ 4% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2019​2018​2017​​​​​​​​Reported GAAP operating income margin​​13.5% ​​ 13.3% ​​ 14.1% ​​​​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin​​15.2% ​​ 14.2% ​​ 14.4% ​​​​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​operating income margin​​15.2% ​​ 14.2% ​​ 14.3% ​​​​​​​​​​​Our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables.

Our reported operating income for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2019 adjusted operating income increased 9% when compared to 2018 adjusted operating income and 2018 adjusted operating income increased 5% when compared to 2017 adjusted operating income. ​As shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2019 and 2018. ​​35 Table of ContentsOther (Income) Expense​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2019 2018 2017Reported GAAP other (income) expense​​ $(76.3)​​​ $(79.9)​​​ $(67.3)Special (gains) and charges​​ 9.5​​ -​​ -Non-GAAP adjusted other (income) expense​​ $(85.8)​​​ $(79.9)​​​ $(67.3)​Our reported other income was $76.3 million, $79.9 million and $67.3 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

The decrease in our 2018 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2017 was driven primarily by lower interest rates on debt. ​Provision for Income Taxes​The following table provides a summary of our tax rate:​​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2019​2018 2017​Reported GAAP tax rate​ 17.0%​20.2% ​13.8% ​Tax rate impact of:​​​​​​​​​​The Tax Act​ 0.1​​(3.4)​​8.7​​Special (gains) and charges 0.6​​0.3 (0.1) ​Discrete tax items 2.6​​3.2 1.4 ​Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 20.3%​ 20.3% 23.8% ​​Our reported tax rate was 17.0%, 20.2%, and 13.8% for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. The enactment of the Tax Act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate.​We recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $58.4 million during 2019. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $43.1 million in 2019. The extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises. We recognized $15.6 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law, which primarily includes $30.4 million benefit due to the passage of the Swiss Tax Reform and AHV Financing Act, a Swiss federal tax law, offset by a tax expense of $10.2 million due to the release of the final Treasury Regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a $16.8 million tax benefit. We finalized the 2015 and 2016 IRS audit, which also resulted in discrete tax expense of $11.0 million. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in non-U.S. jurisdictions.​We recognized total net expense related to discrete tax items of $4.7 million during 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, we filed U.S. federal tax returns which resulted in favorable adjustments of $39.9 million related to changes in estimates and an IRS approved method change. U.S. tax reform (as described further below) resulted in $66.0 million expense for 2018. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $28.1 million in 2018. The extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises. Included within the 2018 provision for income taxes in $44.2 million of discrete charges recorded in the fourth quarter to correct immaterial errors in prior years. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in reserves in non-U.S. jurisdictions, audit settlements and both international and U.S. changes in estimates.36 Table of ContentsOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Tax Act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI), the base erosion anti abuse tax (BEAT) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII). In January 2018, accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the ""period cost method"") or factor such amounts into a company’s measurement of our deferred taxes (the ""deferred method""). We have elected the period cost method and included the GILTI impact in our tax expense.​We initially recorded an estimate of the one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $160.1 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of $66.0 million associated with finalizing our accounting for the Tax Act, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance during the year and finalization of estimates related to asset balances and calculation of foreign earnings and profits. Our 2017 reported rate also includes a $319.0 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the U.S. enacted tax rate of 21%. Our 2017 reported tax rate also includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges, as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of U.S. tax reform of $7.8 million. During 2017, we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of $39.7 million related to excess tax benefits. In addition, we recorded net discrete expenses of $14.4 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 U.S. federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates, partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters. ​The adjusted rate was 20.3% for both 2019 and 2018. The change in our adjusted tax rate from 2018 to 2017 was primarily driven by enactment of the Tax Act, global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, the Tax Act, other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix. ​Net Income Attributable to Ecolab​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019​2018Reported GAAP net income attributable to Ecolab​​ $1,558.9​​​ $1,429.1​​ $1,504.6​ 9%​ (5)%Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges, after tax​ 202.6​​ 102.8​ 56.0​​​​​​Discrete tax net expense (benefit)​ (58.4)​​ 4.7​ (184.2)​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab​​ $1,703.1​​​ $1,536.6​​ $1,376.4​ 11%​ 12%​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Diluted EPS​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(dollars) 2019 2018 2017 2019​2018Reported GAAP diluted EPS​​$ 5.33​​​$ 4.88​​$ 5.12​ 9%​ (5)%Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges​ 0.69​​ 0.35​ 0.19​​​​​​Discrete tax net expense (benefit)​ (0.20)​​ 0.02​ (0.63)​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS​​$ 5.82​​​$ 5.25​​$ 4.68​ 11%​ 12%​Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.

The cash flow impact across the three years from working capital accounts was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections; timing of purchases and production and usage levels; and volume of purchases and timing of payments. ​The impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Dollar Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​​​2019​2018 2017 2019 2018Pensions and postretirement plan contributions ​​ $186.0​​​ $60.0​ ​ $144.1​​ $126.0​ ​ $(84.1)​Restructuring payments​​​ 100.9​​ 57.9​​ 39.2​​ 43.0​​ 18.7​Income tax payments​​​ 356.3​​ 395.2​​ 402.8​​ (38.9)​​ (7.6)​Interest payments​​​ 189.4​​ 206.4​​ 239.3​​ (17.0)​​ (32.9)​​43 Table of ContentsInvesting Activities​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Dollar Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) ​ 2019​2018 2017 2019 2018Cash used for investing activities​​​​ $(1,199.1)​​​ $(1,030.0)​​​ $(1,727.0)​​​ $(169.1)​​​ $697.0​​Cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.​Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $385 million, $221 million and $870 million, respectively. Our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth. We continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities.

We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.​As of December 31, 2019, we had $186 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $159 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, we had $115 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, substantially all of which was held outside of the U.S. ​As of December 31, 2019, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in November 2022. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. The maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our U.S. commercial paper program and our Euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year-end, we had $55.1 million (€50.0 million) of commercial paper outstanding under the Euro commercial paper program and no borrowings under the U.S. commercial paper program. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2019, both programs were rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s, P-2 by Moody’s and F-1 by Fitch.​Additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. These credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. We have $165 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.​As of December 31, 2019, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch both rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at Baa1 (positive outlook). A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures. A schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2019 are summarized in the following table:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payments Due by Period ​​​​​Less​​​​​​​More ​​​​​Than​2-3​4-5​Than (millions)​Total​1 Year​Years​Years​5 Years Notes payable ​$ 25 ​$ 25 ​$ - ​$ - ​$ -​One-time transition tax​ 106​ 7​ -​ 27​ 72​Long-term debt​ 6,271​ 300​ 1,516​ 1,276​ 3,179​Operating leases​ 659​ 174​ 259​ 105​ 121​Interest*​ 2,240​ 212​ 370​ 260​ 1,398​Total​​$ 9,301​​$ 718​​$ 2,145​​$ 1,668​​$ 4,770​​*Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year-end 2019.​As of December 31, 2019, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $28 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2020. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $46 million in 2020. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles. 45 Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements​We do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Operating leases were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in 2018 or 2017. Through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures, some of which have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we neither control, nor are the primary beneficiary. The joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. These entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.​Market Risk​We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges. We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2019, we had no interest rate swaps outstanding. See Note 8 for further information on our hedging activity. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $257 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.​GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT ​Energy Markets Approximately 22% of our sales are generated from our Global Energy segment, the results of which are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets. During 2019, the North American oil industry drilling and production activity slowed from 2018 levels, while international activity showed modest improvement. Demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices well above their lows in early 2016. ​Our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the Global Energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to perform well in the current market. As such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment.​Global Economies​Almost half of our sales are outside of the United States. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.​Argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and increasing borrowing rates. Argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. During 2019, sales in Argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. Assets held in Argentina at the end of 2019 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets. The coronavirus has had a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand, starting in China. We anticipate an impact to our 2020 sales from lower market demand, but we are not yet able to estimate the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak as it continues to spread beyond China.​46 Table of ContentsBrexit Referendum​Effective on January 31, 2020, the U.K. has formally left the European Union. The U.K.’s relationship with the EU will no longer be governed by the EU Treaties, but instead by the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement agreed between the U.K. and the EU in late 2019. The Withdrawal Agreement provides for a “transition” period, which commenced the moment the U.K. leaves the EU and is currently set to end on December 31, 2020. At the end of the transition period, there may be significant changes to the U.K.’s business environment. While the effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to EU markets or the failure to reach such agreements, the uncertainties created by Brexit, any resolution between the U.K. and EU countries or the failure to reach any such resolutions, could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees and could adversely affect our business. ​During 2019, net sales of our U.K. operations were approximately 3% of our consolidated net sales. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS​Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.​SUBSEQUENT EVENTS​Subsequent to year-end, we reached an agreement to purchase CID Lines, a leading global provider of livestock biosecurity and hygiene solutions. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020 subject to various regulatory clearances. ​​​47 Table of ContentsNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES​This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include: ● Fixed currency sales● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales● Adjusted cost of sales● Adjusted gross margin● Fixed currency operating income● Fixed currency operating income margin● Adjusted operating income● Adjusted operating income margin● Adjusted fixed currency operating income● Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income ● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin ● Adjusted other (income) expense ●Adjusted interest expense, net● EBITDA● Adjusted tax rate● Adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab● Adjusted diluted EPS​We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, interest expense and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges. EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.​We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2019. Fixed currency amounts during 2018 for Argentina operations are reflected at the Argentine Peso rate established by management at the beginning of the year.​Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. ​These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts. ​​Item 7A.

Forward-looking statements may also represent challenging goals for us. These statements, which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning various future events, are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those of such forward-looking statements.

Risk Factors.​The following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. See the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” set forth above. ​We may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in other forward-looking statements including those made in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public. ​Economic & Operational Risks​The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted, and we expect will continue to materially and adversely impact, our business.​The COVID-19 pandemic has had a rapid and significant negative impact on the global economy, including a significant downturn in the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries. Measures taken to alleviate the pandemic (such as stay-at-home orders and other responsive measures) have significantly impacted our restaurant and hospitality customers and negatively affected demand for our products and services in these segments, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Prolonged economic weakness, including an extended period of elevated levels of unemployment in the key countries we serve, could further reduce discretionary consumer spending and consumer confidence, which could have a further adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We expect the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, to be dictated by future developments which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted, such as the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the distribution and efficacy of vaccines, the likelihood of a resurgence of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities intended to minimize the spread of the pandemic or to stimulate the economy and other unintended consequences. In addition to the reduction in the demand for our products and services, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business, including, but not limited to, the following:​●We rely on a global workforce and take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and others with whom we do business while continuing to effectively manage our employees and maintain business operations. We have taken additional measures and incurred additional expenses to protect the health and safety of our employees to comply with applicable government requirements and safety guidance. Additionally, our business operations may be disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions or measures responsive to the pandemic, or if members of senior management or our Board of Directors are unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time. Measures taken across our business operations to address health and safety may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employee base, customers and others. Therefore, we could face operational disruptions and incur additional expenses, including devoting additional resources to assisting employees diagnosed with COVID-19 and further changing health and safety protocols and processes, that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.​●A significant number of our employees, as well as customers and others with whom we do business, continue to work remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business operations may be disrupted, and we may experience increased risk of adverse effects to our business, if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements, including due to cybersecurity risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure. Further, if our key operating facilities experience closures or worker shortages as a result of COVID-19, whether temporary or sustained, our business operations could be significantly disrupted.​●Cost management and various cost-containment actions implemented across our business in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could hinder execution of our business strategy, including the deferral of planned capital expenditures, and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.​●We take measures to appropriately reserve for expected credit losses, however we cannot be certain that loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​Our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve.​Economic downturns, and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, refining, pulp and paper, mining and steel industries, can adversely impact our end-users. This year we are experiencing the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for our products and services provided to customers in the full-service restaurant, hospitality, lodging and entertainment industries. In recent years, the weaker global economic environment, particularly in Europe, has also negatively impacted certain of our end-markets. During these periods of weaker economic activity, our customers and potential customers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows. ​17 Table of ContentsOur results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors. ​Economic factors such as the worldwide economy, capital flows, interest rates and currency movements, including, in particular, our exposure to foreign currency risk, have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future. For example, in 2011 and 2012, the European Union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the June 2016 Brexit vote resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and has caused increased fluctuations and unpredictability in foreign currency exchange rates. The possibility for referendum by other EU member states may lead to further market volatility. Other regions of the world, including emerging market areas, also expose us to foreign currency risk. As a result of increasing currency controls, importation restrictions, workforce regulations, pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior to deconsolidation, across the second through fourth quarters of 2015, we devalued our Venezuelan bolivar operations within various of our operating segments, including Water, Paper, Food & Beverage and Institutional. Similar currency devaluations, credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity, including in our key end-markets, and by further weakening the local currency versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations, which are generated in the local currency, and then translated to U.S. dollars.​We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.​We rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. The size and complexity of our information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to failure, malicious intrusion and random attack. Acquisitions have resulted in further de-centralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure. Likewise, data security breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent failures, cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage, business disruption or legal and regulatory costs; could result in third-party claims; could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property, trade secrets or sensitive information; or could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our customer offerings include digital components, such as remote monitoring of certain customer operations. A breach of those remote monitoring systems could expose customer data giving rise to potential third-party claims and reputational damage. There may be other related challenges and risks as we complete implementation of our ERP system upgrade. ​We depend on key personnel to lead our business.​Our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract, retain and develop a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees, particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities to drive business growth, development and profitability. As we continue to grow our business, make acquisitions, expand our geographic scope and offer new products and services, we need the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for executive officer and key employee roles in order to meet the growth, development and profitability goals of our business. Our operations could be materially and adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract, retain or develop such officers or key employees and successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels.​Our results could be materially and adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials.​The prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time, and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs. Changes in raw material prices, unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials, or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms, which may materially and adversely affect our business.​Severe public health outbreaks may materially and adversely impact our business. ​Our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic. Besides the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, public health outbreaks such as Zika virus, Avian Flu, SARS and H1N1 influenza. A prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets. Any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business. Uncertainty with respect to the impact on our financial results of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed further in Management Discussion & Analysis located at Part II, Item 7, of this form 10-K under the heading “Global Economic and Political Environment.”​18 Table of ContentsStrategic Risks​If we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives, including restructurings and our Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system upgrades, our business could be materially and adversely affected.​We continue to execute key business initiatives, including restructurings and investments to develop business systems, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns. In particular, we are undertaking the Accelerate 2020 plan to simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities and focus on key long term growth areas by leveraging technology and structural improvements as discussed under Note 3 entitled “Special (Gains) and Charges” of this Form 10-K. Additionally, we are continuing implementation of our ERP system upgrades, which are expected to continue in phases over the next several years. These upgrades, which include sales, supply chain and certain finance functions, are expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes. These upgrades involve complex business process design and a failure of certain of these processes could result in business disruption. If the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could materially and adversely be affected.​Our growth depends upon our ability to compete successfully with respect to value, innovation and customer support. ​We have numerous global, national, regional and local competitors. Our ability to compete depends in part on providing high quality and high value-added products, technology and service. We must also continue to identify, develop and commercialize innovative, profitable and high value-added products for niche applications and commercial digital applications. We have made significant investments in commercial digital product offerings, and our culture and expertise must continue to evolve to develop, support and profitably deploy commercial digital offerings, which are becoming an increasingly important part of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our technology development goals or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products, technology or services at a competitive disadvantage in the future. In addition, certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets. If we fail to introduce new technologies or commercialize our digital offerings on a timely and profitable basis, we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.​Our significant non-U.S. operations expose us to global economic, political and legal risks that could impact our profitability.​We have significant operations outside the United States, including joint ventures and other alliances. We conduct business in approximately 170 countries and, in 2020, approximately 48% of our net sales originated outside the United States. There are inherent risks in our international operations, including: ​●exchange controls and currency restrictions;●currency fluctuations and devaluations; ●tariffs and trade barriers; ●export duties and quotas;●changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials, energy and utilities; ●changes in local economic conditions; ●changes in laws and regulations, including the imposition of economic or trade sanctions affecting international commercial transactions; ●impact from Brexit and the possibility of similar events in other EU member states;●difficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with international and foreign laws; ●requirements to include local ownership or management in our business; ●economic and business objectives that differ from those of our joint venture partners;●exposure to possible expropriation, nationalization or other government actions; ●restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries; ●unsettled political conditions, military action, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict; and ●countries whose governments have been hostile to U.S.-based businesses. ​As a result of a referendum in June 2016, the UK withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020. It began a transition period in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services that ended on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK agreed to a trade deal with no tariffs nor quotas on products, regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms as well as provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition. Since the referendum, there have been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market conditions in the UK. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the agreed Brexit trade deal will have on our business, particularly our UK and other European operations, however, Brexit and its related effects could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees and could have a material adverse effect our business. 19 Table of Contents​In addition, changes in U.S. or foreign government policy on international trade, including the imposition or continuation of tariffs, could materially and adversely affect our business. In 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on certain imports from China and other countries, resulting in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. While the U.S. and China signed what is being known as the Phase One Deal in January 2020, which included the suspension and rollback of tariffs, any new tariffs imposed by the U.S., China or other countries or any additional retaliatory measures by any of these countries, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.​Also, because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights, we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments. We are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty, which has impacted our business in some countries. Other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors. ​Further, our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations, including anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, as well as U.S. and international economic sanctions regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations; however, there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of us, significant fines and sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.​Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social, legal and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.​Consolidation of our customers and vendors could materially and adversely affect our results.​Customers and vendors in the foodservice, hospitality, travel, healthcare, energy, food processing and pulp and paper industries, as well as other industries we serve, have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue. This consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our pricing, margins and consolidated results of operations.​We enter into multi-year contracts with customers that could impact our results.​Our multi-year contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that these restraints will not have a material adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations.​If we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions, our business could be materially and adversely affected.​As part of our long-term strategy, we seek to acquire complementary businesses. There can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses. If the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates, the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.​Legal, Regulatory & Compliance Risks​Our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations, and we may be materially and adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.​Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment, including evolving climate change standards, and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally, including employment and labor laws and anti-corruption laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs. A violation of these laws and regulations could expose us to financial liability that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards, causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs. The potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and clean-up costs, the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations, and the timing and expense of compliance. Changes to current laws (including tax laws), regulations and policies could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Changes to labor and employment laws and regulations, as well as related rulings by courts and administrative bodies, could materially and adversely affect our operations and expose us to potential financial liability.​20 Table of ContentsPotential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the separation and split-off of our Upstream Energy business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements.​With respect to the separation and subsequent split-off of our Upstream Energy business, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with ChampionX Holding Inc. and ChampionX Corporation (f/k/a Apergy Corporation and taken together with ChampionX Holding Inc., “ChampionX”) as well as certain other agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and our relationship with ChampionX going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and certain other obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between ChampionX and us. If we are required to indemnify ChampionX under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial related liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which ChampionX has agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against ChampionX will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ChampionX will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.​A chemical spill or release could materially and adversely impact our business. ​As a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products, there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled, released or discharged, either in liquid or gaseous form, during production, transportation, storage or use. Such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard. Accordingly, such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.​Extraordinary events may significantly impact our business. ​The occurrence of (a) litigation or claims, (b) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor, (c) repeated or prolonged federal government shutdowns or similar events, (d) war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets), (e) natural or manmade disasters, (f) water shortages or (g) severe weather conditions affecting our operations or the energy, foodservice, hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.​Defense of litigation, particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust, patent infringement, personal injury, product liability, wage hour and class action lawsuits, can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful, and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.​While we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods. ​Federal government shutdowns can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by disrupting or delaying new product launches, renewals of registrations for existing products and receipt of import or export licenses for raw materials or products.​War (including acts of terrorism or hostilities), natural or manmade disasters, water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy, foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, pulp and paper, mining, steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers, which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In particular, the U.S. Gulf Coast is a region with significant refining, petrochemicals and chemicals operations which provide us raw materials, as well as being an important customer base for our Downstream and Water operating segments. Hurricanes or other severe weather events impacting the Gulf Coast could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable cost, or at all, and could adversely affect our business with our customers in the region.​Financial Risks​If the separation and split-off of our Upstream Energy business or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the divestiture are determined to be taxable in whole or in part, we and our stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities.​In connection with the separation and split-off of our Upstream Energy business that was consummated on June 3, 2020, we obtained opinions of outside tax counsel that the related merger and exchange offer will qualify as tax-free transactions to us and our stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Ecolab stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. We have not sought or obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the tax consequences of these transactions. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, which may disagree with the opinion. Even if the merger and exchange offer otherwise qualified as tax-free transactions, they may become taxable to us if certain events occur that affect either Ecolab or ChampionX Corporation. While ChampionX Corporation has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transactions not to qualify as tax-free transactions and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement, the potential tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled. If the merger or exchange offer were determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability, and each U.S. holder of our common stock who participated in the exchange offer could be treated as exchanging the Ecolab shares surrendered for ChampionX Corporation shares in a taxable transaction.​21 Table of ContentsChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.​We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the United States, including tax reform under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which includes broad and complex changes to the United States tax code, and the state tax response to the Tax Act, including, but not limited to variability in our future tax rate. We are also subject to changes in tax law outside the United States. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project (“BEPS”), which is focused on a number of issues, including improving tax disclosure and transparency and eliminating structures and activities that could be perceived by a particular country as resulting in tax avoidance. The changes recommended by the OECD have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business. Some of the BEPS and related proposals, if enacted into law in the United States and in the foreign countries where we do business, could increase the burden and costs of our tax compliance, the amount of taxes we incur in those jurisdictions and our global effective tax rate. In addition, we are impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws (including regulations which interpret the Tax Act) or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.​Future events may impact our deferred tax position, including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely. ​We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases), to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Further, should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates, a deferred tax liability may need to be established.​Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.​As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $6.7 billion in outstanding indebtedness, which was comprised almost entirely of fixed rate debt. Our debt level and related debt service obligations may have negative consequences, including:​●requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; ​●reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and​●increasing our cost of funds and materially and adversely affecting our liquidity and access to the capital markets should we fail to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies. ​If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.​We incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the Nalco transaction and other acquisitions. ​We expect to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future. In connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions, applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values. Intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant. Any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill. If it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business, the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired. In this case, the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment. This write-down of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a non-cash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs. As of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill of $6.0 billion which is maintained in various reporting units, including goodwill from the Nalco transaction. If we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the Nalco transaction or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired, we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment. Impairment losses could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.​22 Table of Contents​Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.​The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.​The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled “Results of Operations” of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP.​Comparability of Results​ChampionX Transaction​On June 3, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our Upstream Energy business (the “ChampionX business”) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”) through the split-off of ChampionX Holding Inc. (“ChampionX”), formed by Ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the ChampionX Business, followed immediately by the merger of ChampionX (the “Merger”) with a wholly owned subsidiary of ChampionX Corporation (f/k/a Apergy Corporation, “Apergy”). ​The ChampionX business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of ChampionX is a strategic shift in business that has a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, we report the historical results of ChampionX, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Unless otherwise noted, the accompanying MD&A has been revised to reflect the ChampionX business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only. ​Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates​Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.​Comparability of Reportable Segments​Effective in the first quarter of 2020, and in anticipation of the separation of the Upstream Energy business, we created the Upstream and Downstream operating segments from the Global Energy operating segment, which was also a reportable segment. Subsequent to the separation of ChampionX, we will no longer report the Upstream Energy segment, which previously held the ChampionX business. ​The Downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the Global Industrial reportable segment. Also, in the first quarter of 2020, we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments and established the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment. This segment is comprised of the Healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Institutional reportable segment and the Life Sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. Additionally, the Textile Care operating segment, which is now being reported in Other, had previously been aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. We also renamed the Global Institutional reportable segment to the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment. We made other immaterial changes, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments. ​Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures​Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods.​27 Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY​In 2020, we faced significant effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. While the greater use of cleaning and sanitizing products benefited consolidated results and led to strong growth in the Healthcare & Life Sciences segment, this was more than offset by reduced overall volumes in the Institutional & Specialty, Industrial and Other segments primarily due to lower levels of global economic activity resulting from mandated government restrictions implemented to control the pandemic spread. Despite the range of actions we took to expand our sales and benefit our earnings through new products, programs, investments in the business and cost efficiency programs, as well as to position us for long term growth, the more substantial impact from the pandemic resulted in lower sales and a significant earnings decline for the full year. ​Sales​Reported sales decreased 6% to $11.8 billion in 2020 from $12.6 billion in 2019. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales decreased 5% compared to the prior year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales decreased 7% compared to the prior year.​Gross Margin​Our reported gross margin was 41.4% of sales for 2020, compared to our 2019 reported gross margin of 43.9%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2020 and 2019, our adjusted gross margin was 41.8% in 2020 and 44.2% in 2019. ​Operating Income ​Reported operating income decreased 24% to $1.4 billion in 2020, compared to $1.8 billion in 2019. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, decreased 19% in 2020. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income decreased 18% in 2020. ​Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) ​Reported continuing operations diluted EPS decreased 32% to $3.33 in 2020 compared to $4.87 in 2019. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2020 were driven primarily by the impact of debt refinancing charges, restructuring charges, disposal and impairment charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges, charges for pay protection for certain employees impacted by COVID-19 net of government subsidies and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the Ecolab Foundation. Adjusted continuing operations diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items decreased 21% to $4.02 in 2020 compared to $5.12 in 2019. ​Balance Sheet​We remain committed to maintaining “A” range ratings metrics, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/Baa1/A- by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.​Net Debt to EBITDA​Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was 2.4 and 2.3 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the “Net Debt to EBITDA” table on page 45 for reconciliation information.​Cash Flow​Cash flow from continuing operations operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to $2.0 billion in 2019. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. ​Dividends ​We increased our quarterly cash dividend 2% in December 2020, bringing annual dividends declared to $1.89 per share. The increase represents our 29th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 84th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.​28 Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES​Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”).​Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.​In March 2020, coronavirus 2019 (“COVID-19”) was declared a pandemic (“pandemic”) by the World Health Organization. As the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial information as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected. ​Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:​Revenue Recognition​Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 842 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.​Our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. We record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses. For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see discussion below.​The revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. For additional information on revenue recognition, see Note 18.​Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities​Allowances for Doubtful Accounts​Accounts receivable are carried at the invoiced amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts, and generally do not bear interest. Our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our expectations of expected credit losses and is determined by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. Our estimates separately consider macroeconomic trends and specific circumstances and credit conditions of customer receivables. Account balances are written off against the allowance when it is determined the receivable will not be recovered.​29 Table of ContentsOur allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $84 million and $56 million, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $16 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.5%, 0.2% and 0.1% in 2020, 2019, and 2018. Our 2020 bad debt expense reflects a slight deterioration in the collectability of our credit portfolio due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an impact on future results consistent with 2020 experience. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see Note 2.​Accrued Liabilities​Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.​We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see Note 16.​Actuarially Determined Liabilities​Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans​The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.​The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.​●The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2020 and 2019, we measured service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2020, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 2.48% from 3.20% at year end 2019. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2020, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 2.37% from 3.16% at year end 2019.​●The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.25% for 2021, 2020 and 2019.​●Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the U.S. pension expenses was 4.03% for 2020, 2019 and 2018. ​●For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2020, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.00% for pre-65 costs and 10.75% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2028 and remain at those levels thereafter.​●In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2020, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2020 projection scale (applied to the Pri-2012 mortality table).​The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans increased to $691 million as of December 31, 2020 from $632 million as of December 31, 2019 (both before tax), primarily due to current year net actuarial losses. ​30 Table of ContentsThe effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2020, on the December 31, 2020 defined benefit obligation and 2021 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans. Expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Effect on U.S. Pension Plans​​​​Increase in​Higher​​Assumption​Recorded​2021(millions)​Change​Obligation​ExpenseDiscount rate -0.25 pts​​ $71.9​​​ $3.3​Expected return on assets -0.25 pts​​N/A​​​ 5.3​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Effect on U.S. Postretirement​​Health Care Benefits Plans​​​​Increase in​Higher​​Assumption​Recorded​2021(millions)​Change​Obligation​ExpenseDiscount rate -0.25 pts ​ $4.5​ ​ $0.2​Expected return on assets -0.25 pts​ N/A​​​ -​​Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.​See Note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.​Self-Insurance​Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. ​Restructuring​Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. These restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets. Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our restructuring liability balance was $102 million and $103 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For additional information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3.​31 Table of ContentsIncome Taxes​Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.​On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Tax Act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti abuse tax (“BEAT”) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”). We have elected the period cost method and included the GILTI impact in our tax expense.​We recorded updates to the estimated discrete tax expense (benefit) of the one-time transition tax in 2018 and 2019 of $66 million and $(3.1) million, respectively, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance in both years, the finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 and 2018 U.S. federal tax returns and the finalization of the balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax. We have completed our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.​Effective Income Tax Rate​Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. ​Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.​Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances​Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. ​Uncertain Tax Positions​A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.​The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. Tax reserves are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $21 million and $27 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For additional information on income taxes see Note 13.​32 Table of ContentsLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill​Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets​We review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for impairment and when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s or assets group’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. ​We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.​Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our Nalco, Anios and CID Lines transactions, which made up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. If our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization.​In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.​Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets​We had total goodwill of $6.0 billion and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.​For our annual 2020 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates. Our goodwill impairment assessments for 2020 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the respective carrying amount of the reporting unit by a significant margin. We assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may not be recoverable. Additionally, no events noted during the second half of 2020 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2020 for any of our eleven reporting units. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.​The Nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset. During the second quarter of 2020, we completed our annual impairment assessment of the Nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. Based on this testing, the estimated fair value of the Nalco trade name exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin; therefore, no adjustment to the $1.2 billion carrying value of this asset was necessary. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired. ​Assets Held for Sale​Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented separately on the balance sheet when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the assets; (2) the assets are available for immediate sale, in their present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets; (3) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated; (4) the sale of the assets is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the assets are being actively marketed for a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value; and (6) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. The ChampionX business met the criteria to be held for sale immediately prior to the Separation. The ChampionX business was previously recorded in the Global Energy reportable segment, which became the Upstream Energy reportable segment beginning in 2020 and subsequently has been reported in discontinued operations. The assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as Current assets of discontinued operations, Long-term assets of discontinued operations, Current liabilities of discontinued operations and Long-term liabilities of discontinued operations, respectively.​​33 Table of ContentsDiscontinued Operations​Discontinued operations comprise those activities that were disposed of during the period or which were classified as held for sale at the end of a period and represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. The ChampionX business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because it was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. The ChampionX business is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 5, Discontinued Operations, for additional information.​​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​2020​2019​2018​2020​2019Product and equipment sales​​ $9,466.6​ ​ $10,129.0​ ​ $9,903.6​ ​​​​​Service and lease sales​​ 2,323.6​​​ 2,433.0​​​ 2,318.5​​​​​​​Reported GAAP net sales​​ $11,790.2​​​ $12,562.0​​​ $12,222.1​​ (6)% ​ 3%Effect of foreign currency translation​ 131.7​ 35.4​​ (207.4)​​​​​​​Non-GAAP fixed currency sales​​ $11,921.9​​​ $12,597.4​​​ $12,014.7​​ (5)% ​ 5%​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​The percentage components of the year-over-year sales change are shown below:​​​​​​​​​​(percent)​2020​2019Volume​ (9)% ​ 1 % Price changes​ 2 ​​ 3 ​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​ (7)​​ 4 ​Acquisitions & divestitures​ 2 ​​ 1 ​Fixed currency sales change​ (5)​​ 5 ​Foreign currency translation​ (1)​​ (2)​Reported GAAP net sales change​ (6)% ​ 3 % ​Amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Cost of Sales (“COS”) and Gross Profit Margin (“Gross Margin”)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2020​2019​2018​​​​ Gross​​​​ Gross​​​​ Gross(millions/percent)​COS​​Margin​​COS​​Margin​​COS​​MarginProduct and equipment cost of sales​ $5,481.3​​​​​​ $5,617.5​​​​​​ $5,510.6​​​​Service and lease cost of sales​ 1,424.5​​​​​​ 1,428.3​​​​​​ 1,364.7​​​​Reported GAAP COS and gross margin​ $6,905.8​​41.4 % ​​ $7,045.8​​43.9 %​​ $6,875.3​​43.7 %Special (gains) and charges​ 48.2​​​​​​ 38.5​​​​​ 4.8​ ​​Non-GAAP adjusted COS and gross margin​ $6,857.6​​ 41.8% ​​ $7,007.3​​44.2 %​​ $6,870.5​​43.8 %​Our COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown above. Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales.​Our reported gross margin was 41.4%, 43.9%, and 43.7% for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our 2020, 2019 and 2018 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $48.2 million, $38.5 million, and $4.8 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the “Special (Gains) and Charges” table on page 35.​Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2020 adjusted gross margin was 41.8% compared against a 2019 adjusted gross margin of 44.2%. The decrease primarily reflected the impact of lower volume, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable business mix, which more than offset pricing.​Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 44.2% and 43.8% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by pricing, which more than offset unfavorable sales mix.​34 Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2020​2019​2018SG&A Ratio 28.1% ​28.3 % ​28.7 %​The decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2020 against 2019 was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, discretionary spend reductions and cost savings initiatives which offset the effects of lower sales. The decreased SG&A ratio comparing 2019 against 2018 was driven primarily by sales leverage, restructuring efforts and cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business​Special (Gains) and Charges​Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income included the following items:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​2020​2019​2018Cost of sales​​​​​​​​​​​​Restructuring activities​ $7.4​​ $20.4​​​ $5.4​Acquisition and integration activities​​ 3.9​​​ 7.6​​​ (0.6)​COVID-19 activities, net​​ 12.5​​​ -​​​ -​Other​​ 24.4​​​ 10.5​​​ -​Cost of sales subtotal​ 48.2​​ 38.5​ 4.8​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges​​​​​​​​​​​​Restructuring activities​ 71.4​​ 93.2​​​ 75.9​Acquisition and integration activities​​ 8.5​​​ 5.6​​​ 8.8​Disposal and impairment activities​​ 41.4​​​ -​​​ -​COVID-19 activities, net​​ 23.6​​​ -​​​ -​Other​ 34.7​​ 21.4​​​ 28.0​Special (gains) and charges subtotal​ 179.6​​ 120.2​ 112.7​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income subtotal​​ 227.8​​​ 158.7​​​ 117.5​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Interest expense, net​​ 83.8​​​ 0.2​​​ 0.3​Other (income) expense​​ 0.4​​​ 9.5​​​ -​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total special (gains) and charges​​ $312.0​​​ $168.4​​​ $117.8​​For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.​Restructuring Activities​Restructuring activities are primarily related to the Institutional Advancement Program and Accelerate 2020, both of which are described below. These activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.​Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.​Institutional Advancement Program​During 2020, we approved a restructuring plan focused on the Institutional business (“the Institutional Plan”) which is intended to enhance our Institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. In February 2021, we expanded the Institutional Plan, and expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by 2023, with total anticipated costs of $80 million ($60 million after tax) or $0.21 per diluted share. The costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and facility closures. We also anticipate non-cash charges related to equipment disposals. We expect total program savings of approximately $50 million by the end of 2024. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.​Certain activities contemplated in this Institutional Plan were previously approved in 2020 and included as part of Accelerate 2020 announced in 2018. These activities have been reclassified to the Institutional Plan. In 2020, we recorded total restructuring charges, including those reclassified from Accelerate 2020, of $35.2 million ($26.4 million after tax) or $0.09 per diluted share, primarily related to severance and costs to support the transition to the new sales structure. All of these charges are recorded within the special (gains) and charges line on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The liability related to the Institutional Plan was $24.7 million as of December 31, 2020. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.​35 Table of ContentsAccelerate 2020​During 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan Accelerate 2020 (“the Plan”), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goal of the Plan is to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilitates and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. In the third quarter of 2020, we expanded the Plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements. Following the establishment of the separate Institutional Plan, we now expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2022, with total anticipated costs of $255 million ($195 million after tax), or $0.67 per diluted share, over this period of time, when revised for continuing operations. Costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken. ​We recorded restructuring charges of $41.8 million ($33.0 million after tax) or $0.11 per diluted share in 2020. Of these expenses, $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share is recorded in other (income) expense. The liability related to the Plan was $71.8 million as of the end of the year. We have recorded $239.2 million ($183.8 million after tax), or $0.63 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the Plan. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.​The Plan has delivered $200 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $315 million by 2022. ​Other Restructuring Activities​During 2020, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.8 million ($1.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, related to an immaterial restructuring plan. The charges are comprised of severance, facility closure costs, including asset disposals, and consulting fees. ​Prior to 2018, we engaged in a number of restructuring plans which have been completed, except for final payments. During 2019, net restructuring gains related to restructuring plans entered into prior to 2018 were $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share. The gains recorded were due to finalizing estimates upon completion of projects. During 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $3.1 million ($2.4 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. ​The restructuring liability balance for all other restructuring plans excluding Accelerate 2020 and the Institutional Advancement Program was $5.9 million and $7.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2020 related to these plans were $2.7 million.​Acquisition and integration related costs​Acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2020 include $8.5 million ($6.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. Charges are related to Copal Invest NV, including its primary operating entity CID Lines (collectively, “CID Lines”), Bioquell PLC (“Bioquell”) and the Laboratoires Anios (“Anios”) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2020 include $3.9 million ($3.2 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the CID Lines inventory, severance and the closure of a facility. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.7 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense in 2020. ​During 2019, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2019 include $5.6 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share.

The acquisition and integration gains reported in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2018 related to changes in estimates related to an early lease exist. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense in 2018. ​Disposal and impairment charges​Disposal and impairment charges reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income include $41.4 million ($41.5 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share in the 2020. During 2020, we recorded a $28.6 million ($28.6 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share impairment for a minority equity method investment due to the COVID-19 impact on the economic environment and the liquidity of the minority equity method investment. In addition, we recorded charges of $12.8 million ($12.9 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share related to the disposal of Holchem Group Limited (“Holchem”) for the loss on sale and related transaction fees during 2020. Further information related to the disposal is included in Note 4. 36 Table of ContentsCOVID-19​During 2020, we recorded charges of $57.1 million to protect the pay for certain employees directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we received subsidies and government assistance, which was recorded as a special (gain) of ($23.4) million during 2020. Finally, we recorded testing charges related to the COVID-19 pandemic of $2.4 million. COVID-19 pandemic charges are recorded in product and equipment sales, service and lease sales, and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Total after tax net charges (gains) related to COVID-19 pandemic were $27.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share.​Other​During 2020 and 2019, we recorded special charges of $24.4 million ($16.0 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share and $10.5 million ($7.1 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, recorded in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income primarily related to a Healthcare product recall in Europe.​Other special charges of $34.7 million ($33.9 million after tax) or $0.12 per diluted share recorded in 2020 and $21.4 million ($16.2 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share recorded in 2019 relate primarily to a specific legal reserve and related legal charges, partially offset by a litigation settlement in 2019, which are recorded in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. We also recorded a $7.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, special charge related to the separation of ChampionX as a tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income​During 2018, we recorded other special charges of $28.0 million ($21.2 million after tax), or $0.07 per diluted share, which primarily consisted of a $25.0 million ($18.9 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, commitment to the Ecolab Foundation. Other charges, primarily litigation related charges, were minimal and have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income.​Other (Income) Expense​During 2020 and 2019, we recorded other expense of $0.4 million ($0.3 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share and $9.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, related to pension curtailments and settlements for ChampionX separation and Accelerate 2020, as discussed further above.

Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales.​37 Table of ContentsOur reported operating income decreased 24% when comparing 2020 to 2019 primarily due to the overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on results, which yielded lower sales and reduced operating leverage, unfavorable business mix, more than offsetting cost savings, favorable pricing and lower variable compensation. Our reported operating income increased 7% when comparing 2019 to 2018 primarily driven by pricing and cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business. Our reported operating income for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2020 adjusted operating income decreased 19% when compared to 2019 adjusted operating income and 2019 adjusted operating income increased 9% when compared to 2018 adjusted operating income. ​As shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2020 and 2019. ​Other (Income) Expense​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2020 2019 2018Reported GAAP other (income) expense​​ ($55.9)​​​ ($77.0)​​​ ($79.9)Special (gains) and charges​​ 0.4​​ 9.5​​ -Non-GAAP adjusted other (income) expense​​ ($56.3)​​​ ($86.5)​​​ ($79.9)​Our reported other income was $55.9 million, $77.0 million and $79.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The decrease in our 2019 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2018 was driven primarily by lower outstanding debt and higher interest income. ​Provision for Income Taxes​The following table provides a summary of our tax rate:​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2020​2019 2018Reported GAAP tax rate​ 15.2%​16.7 % ​20.2 % Tax rate impact of:​​​​​​​​​The Tax Act​ -​​0.1 ​​(3.9)​Special (gains) and charges 0.7​​0.6 0.3 Discrete tax items 3.8​​2.9 3.8 Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 19.7%​ 20.3% 20.4% ​Our reported tax rate was 15.2%, 16.7%, and 20.2% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. ​We recognized a total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $55.8 million during 2020. The tax benefit related to share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $57.3 million. The amount of this tax benefit is subject to variation in stock price and award exercises. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitations which resulted in a $9.8 million tax benefit. Additionally, we recognized a net tax expense of $11.3 million primarily related to the filing of the prior year federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments. ​​38 Table of ContentsWe recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $57.7 million during 2019. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $42.3 million in 2019. We recognized $15.6 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law, which primarily includes $30.4 million benefit due to the passage of the Swiss Tax Reform and AHV Financing Act, a Swiss federal tax law, offset by a tax expense of $10.2 million due to the release of the final Treasury Regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a $13.8 million tax benefit. We finalized the 2015 and 2016 IRS audit, which also resulted in discrete tax expense of $11.0 million. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in non-U.S. jurisdictions.​We recognized total net expense related to discrete tax items of $2.1 million during 2018. We filed U.S. federal tax returns which resulted in favorable adjustments of $39.9 million related to changes in estimates and an IRS approved method change. The Tax Act resulted in $66.0 million expense for 2018 related to updates to the one-time transition tax primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance and finalization of estimates. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $27.7 million in 2018. Included within the 2018 provision for income taxes is $38.0 million of discrete charges to correct immaterial errors in prior years. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in reserves in non-U.S. jurisdictions, audit settlements and both international and U.S. changes in estimates.​The change in our adjusted tax rates from 2018 to 2020 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix. ​Net Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2020 2019 2018Reported GAAP net (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax​​ ($2,172.5)​​​ $133.3​​​ $178.8Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges​​ 2,210.7​​​ 74.3​​​ 14.0Discrete tax net expense (benefit)​​ 22.7​​ (0.7)​​ 2.6Non-GAAP adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax​​ $60.9​​​ $206.9​​​ $195.4​Special charges reported in discontinued operations consist primarily of ChampionX separation charges and restructuring.​Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020​2019Reported GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab​​ $967.4​​​ $1,425.6​​ $1,250.3​ (32)%​ 14%Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges, after tax​ 254.1​​ 128.3​ 88.8​​​​​​Discrete tax net (benefit) expense​ (55.8)​​ (57.7)​ 2.1​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab​​ $1,165.7​​​ $1,496.2​​ $1,341.2​ (22)%​ 12%​Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(dollars) 2020 2019 2018 2020​2019Reported GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations​​$ 3.33​​​$ 4.87​​$ 4.27​ (32)%​ 14%Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges, after tax​ 0.88​​ 0.45​ 0.30​​​​​​Discrete tax net (benefit) expense​ (0.19)​​ (0.20)​ 0.01​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS​​$ 4.02​​​$ 5.12​​$ 4.58​ (21)%​ 12%​Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Currency translation had an unfavorable $0.05 impact on reported and adjusted diluted EPS when comparing 2020 to 2019 and unfavorable $0.12 impact when comparing 2019 to 2018. ​39 Table of ContentsSEGMENT PERFORMANCE​The non-U.S. dollar functional currency international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates established by management for 2020.

The 2020 sales decrease was impacted by regional declines in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in all other regions. Regional results for 2019 were impacted by growth in all major regions. ​At an operating segment level, Water fixed currency sales decreased 2% in 2020 and increased 6% in 2019. Modest Light industry sales growth in 2020 and good sales gains in 2019 were led by innovative technology and service offerings. Heavy industry sales were moderately lower in 2020, impacted by lower end market demand, but grew moderately in 2019 as they benefitted from sales force investments and improved market conditions while mining sales were led by new business wins. Food & Beverage fixed currency sales increased 5% (3% acquisition adjusted) in 2020 as share gains and pricing more than offset generally flat industry trends. Globally, we saw strong growth in our dairy, food, beverage and brewing segments, with moderate growth in the protein business. Fixed currency sales growth was strong across major regions. Fixed currency sales increased 9% in 2019, benefiting from share gains and pricing more than offset generally flat industry trends. Downstream fixed currency sales decreased 8% and increased 1% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, as substantial reductions in transportation fuel demand and additive use hurt 2020 results, while improved pricing in 2019 more than offset lower volume. Paper fixed currency sales were flat in 2020 despite softer industrial containerboard market conditions which reduced volumes in major regions. Fixed currency sales increased 1% in 2019 despite softer containerboard market conditions which reduced volumes in major regions. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins for Global Industrial increased in 2020 and 2019. ​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased 3.6 percentage points in 2020. The favorable impacts of cost savings, pricing, lower delivered product costs and lower variable compensation added approximately 4.2 percentage points during 2020, which more than offset the 0.7 percentage point negative impact of lower volume. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2019 compared to 2018, positively impacted by pricing and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by investments in the business and lower sales volume leverage. ​41 Table of ContentsGlobal Institutional & Specialty​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2020​2019​2018Sales at fixed currency (millions)​ $3,577.2​​​ $4,412.1​​​ $4,255.2​Sales at public currency (millions)​ 3,553.2​​​ 4,401.5​​​ 4,302.0​​​​​​​​​​​​​Volume (21)% ​​ 1% ​​​​Price changes 2% ​​ 2% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​ (20)% ​​ 3% ​​​​Acquisitions and divestitures 1% ​​ 1% ​​​​Fixed currency sales change (19)% ​​ 4% ​​​​Foreign currency translation​ 0% ​​ (1)% ​​​​Public currency sales change (19)% ​​ 2% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income at fixed currency (millions)​ $321.9​​​ $939.8​​​ $901.5​Operating income at public currency (millions)​ 320.3​​​ 937.0​​​ 906.2​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fixed currency operating income change​ (66)% ​​ 4% ​​​​Fixed currency operating income margin 9.0% ​ 21.3% ​ 21.2%Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income change (66)% ​ 5% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 9.0% ​ 21.3% ​​*​Public currency operating income change​ (66)% ​​ 3% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​* Not meaningfulAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Net Sales​Fixed currency sales for Global Institutional & Specialty decreased in 2020 driven by a significant decline in the Institutional business due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased in 2019 benefiting from pricing, volume growth and acquisitions. At a regional level, the 2020 sales decreased in all major regions. At an operating segment level, Institutional fixed currency sales decreased 27% in 2020, reflecting strong hand and surface hygiene sales that were more than offset by the negative effects of mandated reductions for in-unit dining and domestic and international travel that significantly reduced foot traffic at full-service restaurants, occupancy rates at hotels and customer visits to other entertainment facilities through the year. Fixed currency sales increased 2% in 2019 as global lodging demand showed moderate growth while global full-service restaurant industry foot traffic was soft. Specialty fixed currency sales increased 8% (5% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as strong food retail sales growth, benefiting from continued expanded cleaning protocols and frequency in the grocery stores in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and new customer additions, was partially offset by moderately lower quickservice sales, which saw strong hand and surface sanitizer sales more than offset by COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on restaurant volumes. Fixed currency sales increased 9% in 2019, led primarily from strong ongoing business and new account wins. ​Operating Income​Fixed currency operating income for our Global Institutional & Specialty segment decreased in 2020 and increased in 2019 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins decreased in 2020 and remained flat in 2019.​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased 12.3 percentage points during 2020. Margins were negatively impacted approximately 15.0 percentage points during 2020 from volume declines, unfavorable mix and higher bad debt expense, which more than offset the 2.1 percentage points positive impact of cost savings. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2019 due to pricing and cost savings initiatives, which were partially offset by investments in the business and selling related expenses. ​​​​42 Table of ContentsGlobal Healthcare & Life Sciences​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2020​2019​2018Sales at fixed currency (millions)​ $1,189.1​​​ $979.0​​​ $915.7​Sales at public currency (millions)​ 1,181.9​​​ 972.8​​​ 939.5​​​​​​​​​​​​​Volume 18% ​​ 2% ​​​​Price changes 1% ​​ 1% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​ 19% ​​ 2% ​​​​Acquisitions and divestitures 2% ​​ 4% ​​​​Fixed currency sales change 21% ​​ 7% ​​​​Foreign currency translation​ 0% ​​ (3)% ​​​​Public currency sales change 21% ​​ 4% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income at fixed currency (millions)​ $207.6​​​ $124.5​​​ $124.4​Operating income at public currency (millions)​ 205.0​​​ 122.9​​​ 127.7​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fixed currency operating income change​ 67% ​​ 0% ​​​​Fixed currency operating income margin 17.5% ​ 12.7% ​ 13.6%Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income change 67% ​ 0% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 17.8% ​ 12.7% ​​*​Public currency operating income change​ 67% ​​ (4)% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​* Not meaningfulAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Net Sales​​Fixed currency sales increased for Global Healthcare & Life Sciences in both 2020 and 2019 as growth in both years was driven by volume and pricing gains. At an operating segment level, Healthcare fixed currency sales increased 18% (16% acquisition adjusted) in 2020. Strong COVID-19 pandemic related hand and surface disinfection sales growth more than offset the unfavorable effects of delayed elective surgical procedures. Fixed currency sales increased 1% in 2019 as good growth in Europe was offset by a product recall, while North America sales were flat as good differentiated product and program growth was partially offset by lower sales of deemphasized non-core products. Life Sciences fixed currency sales increased 35% in 2020. Results were led by strong demand for biodecontamination units, business wins and pricing in our cleaning and disinfection programs for both the pharmaceutical and personal care markets, with strong growth in Europe and moderate North America gains. Fixed currency sales increased 37% (12% acquisition adjusted) in 2019 led by business wins and pricing in our cleaning and disinfection programs for both the pharmaceutical and personal care markets, with strong growth in Europe and moderate North America gains. ​​Operating Income​Fixed currency operating income for our Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment increased in 2020 and remained flat in 2019 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2020 and decreased in 2019. ​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased 5.1 percentage points in 2020. Strong volume gains, reduced discretionary spending and pricing positively impacted margins by approximately 6.6 percentage points, partially offset by the 1.1 percentage point negative impact of higher delivered product costs. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased in 2019 compared to 2018, negatively impacted by investments in the business and the impact of the Healthcare recall, partially offset by sales volume leverage and cost savings initiatives.​43 Table of ContentsOther​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2020​2019​2018Sales at fixed currency (millions)​ $1,093.3​​​ $1,211.7​​​ $1,155.3​Sales at public currency (millions)​ 1,084.3​​​ 1,207.5​​​ 1,173.8​​​​​​​​​​​​​Volume (11)% ​​ 3% ​​​​Price changes 2% ​​ 2% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​ (10)% ​​ 5% ​​​​Acquisitions and divestitures 0% ​​ 0% ​​​​Fixed currency sales change (10)% ​​ 5% ​​​​Foreign currency translation​ 0% ​​ (2)% ​​​​Public currency sales change (10)% ​​ 3% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income at fixed currency (millions)​ $131.5​​​ $167.0​​​ $164.0​Operating income at public currency (millions)​ 130.6​​​ 166.3​​​ 165.5​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fixed currency operating income change​ (21)% ​​ 2% ​​​​Fixed currency operating income margin 12.0% ​ 13.8% ​ 14.2%Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income change (21)% ​ 2% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 12.0% ​ 13.8% ​​*​Public currency operating income change​ (21)% ​​ 0% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​* Not meaningfulAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Net Sales​Fixed currency sales for Other decreased in 2020.

The 2020 cash flow impact from working capital accounts was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by lower inventory turnover and slower accounts receivable collection. ​The impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Dollar Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​2020​2019 2018 2020 2019Pensions and postretirement plan contributions​ $70.7​​​ $186.0​ ​ $60.0​​ ($115.3)​ ​ $126.0​Restructuring payments​ 71.1​​ 82.5​​ 46.0​​ (11.4)​​ 36.5​Income tax payments​ 366.9​​ 337.4​​ 365.1​​ 29.5​​ (27.7)​Interest payments​ 262.5​​ 189.4​​ 206.4​​ 73.1​​ (17.0)​​​45 Table of ContentsInvesting Activities​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Dollar Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2020​2019 2018 2020 2019Cash used for investing activities​​ ($857.7)​​​ ($1,129.6)​​​ ($961.9)​​​ $271.9​​​ ($167.7)​​Cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.​Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $371 million, $385 million and $221 million, respectively. Our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth. We continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities.

We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.​As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,260 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $59 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2019, we had $119 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $91 million was held outside of the U.S. We have increased our available cash on hand during the year to meet current and any future potential operational cash needs as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments.​As of December 31, 2020, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in November 2022. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. The maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our U.S. commercial paper program and our Euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year end, we had no outstanding commercial paper under our Euro or U.S. program. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. As of December 31, 2020, both programs were rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s, P-2 by Moody’s and F-1 by Fitch.​As of December 31, 2020, we have a $500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement, which expires in April 2021. The revolving credit agreement is to be used for general corporate purposes with a diverse syndicate of banks to provide for further liquidity in response to the coronavirus pandemic. There were no borrowings under this revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we executed a $305 million term credit agreement in April 2020, which we drew on and repaid $303 million during the second quarter of 2020. ​Additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. These credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. We have $123 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.​As of December 31, 2020, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch both rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at Baa1 (positive outlook). A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.

We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2020. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $47 million in 2020. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles. 47 Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements​We do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures, some of which have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we neither control, nor are the primary beneficiary. The joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. These entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.​Market Risk​We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges. We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2020, we had no interest rate swaps outstanding. See Note 9 for further information on our hedging activity. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $213 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.​GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT ​Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ​In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic affected global economies and financial markets throughout 2020, and industries faced challenges from restricted economic conditions resulting from government and private efforts to address the pandemic. As the pandemic continued and new variants of COVID-19 were identified, most countries required companies to limit or suspend business operations and implemented travel restrictions. These conditions had and are expected to continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world over the foreseeable future until the pandemic diminishes. We experienced, and anticipate continued, overall adverse impacts and disruptions in our restaurant, hospitality and entertainment-related business operations, with modest impact on our Industrial segment businesses and limited or no adverse impacts on certain other parts of our business, supply chain and business continuity plans from COVID-19 restrictions; in addition, certain of our business have and will continue to benefit from increased cleaning and sanitizing product demand.​While we anticipate our 2021 results of operations to be generally comparable to 2019, we are not yet able to adequately estimate the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our end markets and our business due to the pandemic’s evolving nature and the public and private responses to it. While we expect favorable conditions to resume in our industrial markets, and expect conditions to continue to be favorable in our healthcare and life sciences markets, we anticipate products and services provided to the full-service restaurant, hospitality, lodging and entertainment industries will continue to be negatively impacted over the near term due to the regulatory and organizational operating restrictions and mandates that have been put in place and affecting those end markets. We have taken, and are continuing to take, steps to drive revenue growth through new products, programs and markets, as well as steps to reduce costs, including reductions in capital expenditures, as well as other ongoing cost initiatives. ​The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. We have taken advantage of the employer payroll tax (FICA) deferral offered by the CARES Act, which allowed us to defer the payment of employer payroll taxes for the period from March 27, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The deferred FICA liability was $66.4 million and will be payable in equal installments at December 2021 and December 2022.​Global Economies​Almost half of our sales are outside of the United States. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.​48 Table of ContentsArgentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and increasing borrowing rates. Argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. During 2020, sales in Argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. Assets held in Argentina at the end of 2020 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets. Brexit Referendum​December 31, 2020 marked the end of the Brexit Transition Period and with it the UK’s departure from the European Union (EU) customs union and single market. The EU and UK arrived at a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, (TCA) allowing companies to trade tariff free on products having EU origins. We are working through the details of this TCA impact with the expectation that much of our trade will in fact be free of tariff.​During 2020, net sales of our U.K. operations were approximately 3% of our consolidated net sales. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS​Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.​SUBSEQUENT EVENTS​Subsequent to year end, we separately acquired European Institutional and Healthcare businesses. The aggregate purchase consideration for these two acquisitions was approximately $100 million. The acquisitions are not material to our consolidated financial statements individually or in the aggregate.​NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES​This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include: ● Fixed currency sales● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales● Adjusted cost of sales● Adjusted gross margin● Fixed currency operating income● Fixed currency operating income margin● Adjusted operating income● Adjusted operating income margin● Adjusted fixed currency operating income● Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income ● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin ● Adjusted other (income) expense ●Adjusted interest expense, net● EBITDA● Adjusted tax rate● Adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax● Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab● Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations​We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, interest expense and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges. EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.​49 Table of ContentsWe evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2020. Fixed currency amounts during 2018 for Argentina operations are reflected at the Argentine Peso rate established by management at the beginning of the year.​Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. ​These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts. ​​Item 7A.

31462,ECL,ECOLAB INC.,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.​The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.​The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled “Results of Operations” of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP.​Comparability of Results​Purolite acquisition​On December 1, 2021, we acquired Purolite for total consideration of $3.7 billion in cash. Purolite is a leading and fast-growing global provider of high-end ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. Headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Purolite operates in more than 30 countries. Purolite is reported within our Life Sciences operating segment. Acquisition and integration charges are recorded within special (gains) and charges. 26 Table of ContentsIn addition, the remaining impacts of the Purolite acquisition including operating results, acquisition-related amortization and interest expense related to the transaction have also been excluded from adjusted results. ​ChampionX Transaction​On June 3, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our Upstream Energy business (the “ChampionX business”) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”) through the split-off of ChampionX Holding Inc. (“ChampionX”), formed by Ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the ChampionX Business, followed immediately by the merger of ChampionX (the “Merger”) with a wholly owned subsidiary of ChampionX Corporation (f/k/a Apergy Corporation, “Apergy”). ​The ChampionX business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of ChampionX was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, we report the historical results of ChampionX, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Unless otherwise noted, the accompanying MD&A has been revised to reflect the ChampionX business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only. ​Comparability of Reportable Segments​Effective in the first quarter of 2020, and in anticipation of the separation of the Upstream Energy business, we created the Upstream and Downstream operating segments from the Global Energy operating segment, which was also a reportable segment. Subsequent to the separation of ChampionX, we no longer report the Upstream Energy segment, which previously held the ChampionX business. ​The Downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the Global Industrial reportable segment. Also, in the first quarter of 2020, we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments and established the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment. This segment is comprised of the Healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Institutional reportable segment and the Life Sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. Additionally, the Textile Care operating segment, which is now being reported in Other, had previously been aggregated in the Global Industrial reportable segment. We also renamed the Global Institutional reportable segment to the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment. We made other immaterial changes, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments. ​Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures​Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. As part of the separation, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.​Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates​Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.​​EXECUTIVE SUMMARY​In 2021, we delivered strong sales performance in an environment where COVID-19 infections impacted business activity and further disrupted global supply chains which together, impacted the global recovery. Delivered product cost inflation and other supply constraints increased significantly but we undertook extraordinary measures to assure our customers were supplied with our critical products and services. Double-digit sales growth in the Institutional & Specialty and Other segments along with strong Industrial segment growth more than offset the Healthcare & Life Sciences segment’s decline versus a very strong gain last year. Accelerating pricing and higher volume more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida, and the comparison to lower variable compensation last year.​Sales​Reported sales increased 8% to $12.7 billion in 2021 from $11.8 billion in 2020. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5% compared to the prior year.​27 Table of ContentsGross Margin​Our reported gross margin was 40.2% of sales for 2021, compared to our 2020 reported gross margin of 41.4%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and impacts from the Purolite transaction included in cost of sales from both 2021 and 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 40.9% in 2021 and 41.8% in 2020. ​Operating Income ​Reported operating income increased 15% to $1.6 billion in 2021, compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, increased 11% in 2021. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 8% in 2021. ​Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) ​Reported continuing operations diluted EPS increased 17% to $3.91 in 2021 compared to $3.33 in 2020. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2021 include COVID-19 related charges, restructuring charges, debt refinancing charges, acquisition and integration charges, and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2020 include debt refinancing charges, restructuring charges, disposal and impairment charges, Healthcare product recall charges, acquisition and integration charges, COVID-19 related charges, and litigation and other charges. Special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges and litigation and other charges. The impact of the Purolite transaction was $0.02 per share dilutive to reported earnings per share from continuing operations (excluding special charges) as sales since its December 1, 2021 acquisition were more than offset by acquisition-related amortization and interest expense. Adjusted continuing operations diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the impacts of the Purolite transaction and discrete tax items increased 17% to $4.69 in 2021 compared to $4.02 in 2020. ​Balance Sheet​We remain committed to maintaining “A” range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/A3/A- by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.​Net Debt to EBITDA​Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was 3.4 and 2.4 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the “Net Debt to EBITDA” table on page 44 for reconciliation information.​Cash Flow​Cash flow from continuing operations operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2021 compared to $1.7 billion in 2020. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. ​Dividends ​We increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in December 2021, bringing annual dividends declared to $1.95 per share. The increase represents our 30th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 85th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.​​CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES​Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”).​Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.​In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial 28 Table of Contentsinformation as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected. ​Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:​Revenue Recognition​Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 842 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.​Our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. We record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses. ​The revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. For additional information on revenue recognition, refer to Note 18.​Litigation and Environmental Liabilities​Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.​We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 16.​Actuarially Determined Liabilities​Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans​The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.​The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.​●The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2021 and 2020, we measured service and interest costs by applying the 29 Table of Contentsspecific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.86% from 2.48% at year-end 2020. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.75% from 2.37% at year-end 2020.​●The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.00% for 2021, 7.25% for 2020 and 7.25% for 2019.​●Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the U.S. pension expenses was 4.03% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. ​●For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2021, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs and 7.25% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 4.5% in 2029 and remain at those levels thereafter.​●In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2021 projection scale (applied to the Pri-2012 mortality table).​The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans decreased to $397 million as of December 31, 2021 from $691 million as of December 31, 2020 (both before tax), primarily due to current year net actuarial gains. ​The effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2021, on the December 31, 2021 defined benefit obligation and 2022 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans. Expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Effect on U.S. Pension Plans​​​​Increase in​Higher​​Assumption​Recorded​2022(millions)​Change​Obligation​ExpenseDiscount rate -0.25 pts​​ $65.6​​​ $3.3​Expected return on assets -0.25 pts​​N/A​​​ 5.3​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Effect on U.S. Postretirement​​Health Care Benefits Plans​​​​Increase in​Higher​​Assumption​Recorded​2022(millions)​Change​Obligation​ExpenseDiscount rate -0.25 pts ​ $4.4​ ​ $0.1​Expected return on assets -0.25 pts​ N/A​​​ -​​Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.​Refer to Note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.​Self-Insurance​Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. ​​30 Table of ContentsIncome Taxes​Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.​Effective Income Tax Rate​Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. ​Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.​Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances​Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. ​Uncertain Tax Positions​A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a liability for uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.​The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The liability for uncertain tax positions is reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million and $21 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional information on income taxes refer to Note 13.​Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill​Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets​Long-lived and amortizable intangible assets acquired are recorded on the acquisition date at their respective fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in U.S. GAAP. This requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows, such as growth rates, royalty rates or discount rates. ​We review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.8 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s or assets group’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. ​We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.​​31 Table of ContentsGlobally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our Nalco, Anios, CID Lines and Purolite transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. If our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and significances of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization.​In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.​Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets​We had total goodwill of $8.1 billion and $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.​For our annual 2021 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions, including future operating performance, long-term growth, and discount rates. Our goodwill impairment assessments for 2021 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin. We assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be higher than its fair value. Additionally, no events noted during the second half of 2021 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2021 for any of our eleven reporting units. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.​The Nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset. During the second quarter of 2021, we completed our annual impairment assessment of the Nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions, including future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. Our Nalco tradename impairment assessment for 2021 indicated the estimated fair value of the Nalco trade name exceeded its $1.2 billion carrying amount by a significant margin. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired. ​​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​2021​2020​2019​2021​2020Product and equipment sales​​ $10,153.3​ ​ $9,466.6​ ​ $10,129.0​ ​​​​​Service and lease sales​​ 2,579.8​​​ 2,323.6​​​ 2,433.0​​​​​​​Reported GAAP net sales​​ 12,733.1​​​ 11,790.2​​​ 12,562.0​​ 8% ​ (6)%Impact of Purolite on net sales​​ 12.0​​​ -​​​ -​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted net sales​​ 12,721.1​​​ 11,790.2​​​ 12,562.0​​ 8% ​ (6)%Effect of foreign currency translation​ 111.7​ 332.1​​ 241.2​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency sales​​ $12,832.8​​​ $12,122.3​​​ $12,803.2​​ 6% ​ (5)%​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​The percentage components of the year-over-year sales change are shown below:​​​​​​​​​​​(percent)​2021​2020Volume​ ​3 % ​ (9)% Price changes​ ​2 ​​ 2 ​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​ ​5 ​​ (7)​Acquisitions & divestitures​ ​1 ​​ 2 ​Fixed currency sales change​ ​6 ​​ (5)​Foreign currency translation​ ​2 ​​ (1)​Reported GAAP net sales change​ ​8 % ​ (6)% ​Amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.32 Table of ContentsCost of Sales (“COS”) and Gross Profit Margin (“Gross Margin”)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2021​2020​2019​​​​ Gross​​​​ Gross​​​​ Gross(millions/percent)​COS​​Margin​​COS​​Margin​​COS​​MarginProduct and equipment cost of sales​ $6,100.9​​​​​​ $5,481.3​​​​​​ $5,617.5​​​​Service and lease cost of sales​ 1,514.9​​​​​​ 1,424.5​​​​​​ 1,428.3​​​​Reported GAAP COS and gross margin​ 7,615.8​​40.2 % ​​ 6,905.8​​41.4 %​​ 7,045.8​​43.9 %Special (gains) and charges​ 93.9​​​​​​ 48.2​​​​​ 38.5​ ​​Impact of Purolite on COS​ 7.6​​​​​​ -​​​​​​ -​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted COS and gross margin​ $7,514.3​​40.9 % ​​ $6,857.6​​41.8 %​​ $7,007.3​​44.2 %​Our COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown above. Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales.​Our reported gross margin was 40.2%, 41.4%, and 43.9% for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our 2021, 2020 and 2019 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $93.9 million, $48.2 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the “Special (Gains) and Charges” table below.​Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, our 2021 adjusted gross margin was 40.9% compared against a 2020 adjusted gross margin of 41.8%. The decrease primarily reflected increased pricing and higher volumes which were more than offset by significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida.​Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 41.8% and 44.2% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease primarily reflected the impact of lower volume, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable business mix, which more than offset pricing.​Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2021​2020​2019SG&A Ratio 26.8% ​28.1 % ​28.3 %​The decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by higher net sales, cost savings initiatives and reduction in bad debt, partially offset by higher variable compensation compared to last year. The decreased SG&A ratio comparing 2020 against 2019 was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, discretionary spend reductions and cost savings initiatives which offset the effects of lower sales.​Special (Gains) and Charges​Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income included the following items:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​2021​2020​2019Cost of sales​​​​​​​​​​​​Restructuring activities​ $24.7​​ $7.4​​​ $20.4​Acquisition and integration activities​​ 4.2​​​ 3.9​​​ 7.6​COVID-19 activities, net​​ 64.7​​​ 12.5​​​ -​Other​​ 0.3​​​ 24.4​​​ 10.5​Cost of sales subtotal​ 93.9​​ 48.2​ 38.5​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges​​​​​​​​​​​​Restructuring activities​ 11.9​​ 71.4​​​ 93.2​Acquisition and integration activities​​ 29.9​​​ 8.5​​​ 5.6​Disposal and impairment activities​​ -​​​ 41.4​​​ -​COVID-19 activities, net​​ 42.4​​​ 23.6​​​ -​Other​ 18.4​​ 34.7​​​ 21.4​Special (gains) and charges subtotal​ 102.6​​ 179.6​ 120.2​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income subtotal​​ 196.5​​​ 227.8​​​ 158.7​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Other (income) expense​​ 37.2​​​ 0.4​​​ 9.5​Interest expense, net​​ 33.1​​​ 83.8​​​ 0.2​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total special (gains) and charges​​ $266.8​​​ $312.0​​​ $168.4​​33 Table of ContentsFor segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.​Restructuring Activities​Restructuring activities are primarily related to the Institutional Advancement Program and Accelerate 2020, both of which are described below. These activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.​Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.​Institutional Advancement Program​We approved a restructuring plan in 2020 focused on the Institutional business (“the Institutional Plan”) which is intended to enhance our Institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. In February 2021, we expanded the Institutional Plan, and expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by 2023, with total anticipated costs of $65 million ($50 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share. The costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and facility closures. We also anticipate non-cash charges related to equipment disposals. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.​In 2021, we recorded total restructuring charges of $12.6 million ($10.2 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share, primarily related to severance, disposals of equipment and office closures. We have recorded $47.8 million ($36.6 million after tax), or $0.13 per diluted share of cumulative restructuring charges under the Institutional Plan. The liability related to the Institutional Plan was $5.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.​The Institutional Plan has delivered $41 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $50 million in continuing operations by 2024. ​Accelerate 2020​During 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan Accelerate 2020 (“the Plan”), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goal of the Plan is to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. During 2020, we expanded the Plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements. Following the establishment of the separate Institutional Plan, we now expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2022, with total anticipated costs of $255 million ($195 million after tax), or $0.67 per diluted share, over this period of time, when revised for continuing operations. Costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken. ​We recorded restructuring charges of $5.3 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2021. The liability related to the Plan was $32.7 million as of the end of the year. We have recorded $244.5 million ($190.0 million after tax), or $0.66 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the Plan. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.​The Plan has delivered $300 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $315 million in continuing operations by 2022. ​Other Restructuring Activities​During 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of $18.7 million ($17.0 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring activity. The charges primarily related to severance and asset write-offs.​During 2020, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.8 million ($1.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring plan. The charges are comprised of severance, facility closure costs, including asset disposals, and consulting fees. ​During 2019, net restructuring gains related to restructuring plans entered into prior to 2019 were $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share. ​The restructuring liability balance for all other restructuring plans excluding Accelerate 2020 and the Institutional Plan were $4.6 million and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2021 related to all other restructuring plans excluding the Accelerate 2020 and Institutional Plan were $10.5 million.​​34 Table of ContentsAcquisition and integration related costs​Acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $29.9 million ($23.5 million after tax) or $0.08 per diluted share. Charges are related to the Purolite Corporation (“Purolite”), Copal Invest NV, including its primary operating entity CID Lines (collectively, “CID Lines”), and Bioquell PLC (“Bioquell”) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $4.2 million ($3.3 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the Purolite inventory. In conjunction with its acquisitions, we incurred $0.8 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2021.​During 2020, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $8.5 million ($6.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share.

During 2020, we recorded a $28.6 million ($28.6 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share impairment for a minority equity method investment due to the COVID-19 impact on the economic environment and the liquidity of the minority equity method investment. In addition, we recorded charges of $12.8 million ($12.9 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share related to the disposal of Holchem Group Limited (“Holchem”) for the loss on sale and related transaction fees during 2020. Further information related to the disposal is included in Note 4. ​COVID-19 activities​Customer demand for sanitizer products surged at the outset of COVID-19. We worked hard to meet the rapidly increasing demand and sold the vast majority of the sanitizer inventory. However, COVID-19 variant-related delays of customer’s reopening and consumer activity resulted in a small portion of excess sanitizer inventory. We have recorded inventory reserves of $60 million during 2021 for excess sanitizer inventory and estimated disposal costs. During 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $36.8 million and $57.1 million, respectively, to protect the wages of certain employees directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also recorded charges of $16.5 million and $2.4 million related to employee COVID-19 testing and related expenses during 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we received subsidies and government assistance, which were recorded as a special (gain) of ($6.2) million and ($23.4) million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. COVID-19 pandemic charges are recorded in product and equipment cost of sales, service and lease cost of sales, and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Total after tax net charges (gains) related to COVID-19 pandemic were $81.3 million or $0.28 per diluted share and $27.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share during 2021 and 2020, respectively.​Other operating activities ​During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded special charges of $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share, $24.4 million ($16.0 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share and $10.5 million ($7.1 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, recorded in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income primarily related to a Healthcare product recall in Europe.​Other special charges of $18.4 million ($14.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share in 2021, $34.7 million ($33.9 million after tax) or $0.12 per diluted share recorded in 2020 and $21.4 million ($16.2 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share recorded in 2019 relate primarily to a specific legal reserve and related legal charges, partially offset by a litigation settlement in 2019, which are recorded in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded during 2020 a $7.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, special charge related to the separation of ChampionX as a tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. ​​35 Table of ContentsOther (income) expense​During 2021, we incurred settlement expense recorded in other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $37.2 million ($28.7 million after tax), or $0.10 per diluted share related to U.S. pension plan lump-sum payments to retirees.​During 2020 and 2019, we recorded other expense of $0.4 million ($0.3 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share and $9.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively, related to pension curtailments and settlements for ChampionX separation and Accelerate 2020.

In addition, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, an immaterial amount of interest expense was recorded due to acquisition and integration costs.​Operating Income and Operating Income Margin​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​ ​​Percent Change​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2021 2020 2019​​2021​2020Reported GAAP operating income​​ $1,598.6​​​ $1,395.7​​​ $1,845.2​​​​ 15% ​​ (24)% Special (gains) and charges ​ 196.5​​​ 227.8​​​ 158.7​​​ ​​​ ​​Impact of Purolite on operating income​​ 3.8​​​ -​​​ -​​​​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted operating income ​ 1,798.9​​​ 1,623.5​​​ 2,003.9​​​ 11​​ (19)​Effect of foreign currency translation ​ 18.9​​​ 52.8​​​ 37.2​​​ ​​​ ​​Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income ​​ $1,817.8​​​ $1,676.3​​​ $2,041.1​​​​ 8% ​​ (18)% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2021​2020​2019​​​​​​​Reported GAAP operating income margin​​12.6% ​​ 11.8% ​​ 14.7% ​​​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin​​14.1% ​​ 13.8% ​​ 16.0% ​​​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin ​​14.2% ​​ 13.8% ​​ 15.9% ​​​​​​​​​​Our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables. Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales.​Our reported operating income increased 15% when comparing 2021 to 2020 primarily driven by increased pricing and higher volume which more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida and higher variable compensation compared to last year. Our reported operating income decreased 24% when comparing 2020 to 2019 primarily due to the overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on results, which yielded lower sales and reduced operating leverage, unfavorable business mix, more than offsetting cost savings, favorable pricing and higher variable compensation. Our reported operating income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the Purolite transaction, 2021 adjusted operating income increased 11% when compared to 2020 adjusted operating income and 2020 adjusted operating income decreased 19% when compared to 2019 adjusted operating income. ​Other (Income) Expense​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2021 2020 2019Reported GAAP other (income) expense​​ ($33.9)​​​ ($55.9)​​​ ($77.0)Special (gains) and charges​​ 37.2​​ 0.4​​ 9.5Non-GAAP adjusted other (income) expense​​ ($71.1)​​​ ($56.3)​​​ ($86.5)​Our reported other income was $33.9 million, $55.9 million and $77.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding the impact of settlements and curtailments recorded in special (gains) and charges during 2021, 2020 and 2019, our adjusted other income was $71.1 million, $56.3 million and $86.5 million, respectively, reflecting lower interest costs associated with future payments of employee pension obligations.​Interest Expense, Net​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2021 2020 2019Reported GAAP interest expense, net​​ $218.3​​​ $290.2​​​ $190.7Special (gains) and charges​​ 33.1​​ 83.8​​ 0.2Impact of Purolite on interest expense​​ 3.5​​​ -​​​ -Non-GAAP adjusted interest expense, net​​ $181.7​​​ $206.4​​​ $190.5​36 Table of ContentsOur reported net interest expense totaled $218.3 million, $290.2 million and $190.7 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.​We incurred $33.1 million ($29.0 million after tax), or $0.10 per diluted share, $83.8 million ($64.6 million after tax), or $0.22 per diluted share and $0.2 million ($0.1 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense special charges in conjunction with our debt refinancing and acquisitions during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.​Adjusted for special (gains) and charges and the Purolite transaction, the decrease in interest expense when comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by a reduction in average debt levels and average interest rates. The increase in our 2020 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2019 was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt. ​Provision for Income Taxes​The following table provides a summary of our tax rate:​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2021​2020 2019Reported GAAP tax rate​ 19.1%​15.2 % ​16.7 % Tax rate impact of:​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges 0.1​​0.7 0.6 Discrete tax items​ (0.3)​​3.8 ​​3.0 ​Purolite tax impacts -​​ - - Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 18.9%​ 19.7% 20.3% ​Our reported tax rate was 19.1%, 15.2%, and 16.7%, for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. ​We recognized net tax expense of $5.8 million related to discrete tax items during 2021. This included a non-cash deferred tax expense of $25.1 million associated with transferring certain intangible property between affiliates. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit was $29.1 million. The amount of this tax benefit is subject to variation in stock price and award exercises. The remaining discrete tax expense of $9.8 million was primarily related to the filing of federal, state, and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax law, audit settlements and other changes in estimates.​We recognized a total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $55.8 million during 2020. The tax benefit related to share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $57.3 million. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitations which resulted in a $9.8 million tax benefit. Additionally, we recognized a net tax expense of $11.3 million primarily related to the filing of the prior year federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments. ​We recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $57.7 million during 2019. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $42.3 million in 2019. We recognized $15.6 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law, which primarily includes $30.4 million benefit due to the passage of the Swiss Tax Reform and AHV Financing Act, a Swiss federal tax law, offset by a tax expense of $10.2 million due to the release of the final Treasury Regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a $13.8 million tax benefit. We finalized the 2015 and 2016 IRS audit, which also resulted in discrete tax expense of $11.0 million. The remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in non-U.S. jurisdictions.​The change in our adjusted tax rates from 2019 to 2021 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix. ​Net Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2021 2020 2019Reported GAAP net (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax​​ $-​​​ ($2,172.5)​​​ $133.3Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges​​ -​​​ 2,210.7​​​ 74.3Discrete tax net expense (benefit)​​ -​​ 22.7​​ (0.7)Non-GAAP adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax​​ $-​​​ $60.9​​​ $206.9​Special charges reported in discontinued operations consist primarily of ChampionX separation charges.​37 Table of ContentsNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021​2020Reported GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab​​ $1,129.9​​​ $967.4​​ $1,425.6​ 17%​ (32)%Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges, after tax​ 213.5​​ 254.1​ 128.3​​​​​​Discrete tax net (benefit) expense​​ 5.8​​​ (55.8)​​ (57.7)​​​​​​Impact of Purolite on net income​ 5.6​​ -​ -​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab​​ $1,354.8​​​ $1,165.7​​ $1,496.2​ 16%​ (22)%​Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(dollars) 2021 2020 2019 2021​2020Reported GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations​​$ 3.91​​​$ 3.33​​$ 4.87​ 17%​ (32)%Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges, after tax​ 0.74​​ 0.88​ 0.45​​​​​​Discrete tax net (benefit) expense​ 0.02​​ (0.19)​ (0.20)​​​​​​Impact of Purolite on diluted EPS​​ 0.02​​​ -​​ -​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations​​ $4.69​​​$ 4.02​​$ 5.12​ 17%​ (21)%​Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Currency translation had an favorable $0.11 impact on reported and adjusted diluted EPS when comparing 2021 to 2020 and unfavorable $0.05 impact when comparing 2020 to 2019. ​38 Table of ContentsSEGMENT PERFORMANCE​The non-U.S. dollar functional currency international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates established by management for 2021.

The 2020 sales decrease was impacted by regional declines in North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in all other regions. ​At an operating segment level, Water fixed currency sales increased 6% in 2021 as strong new business wins and accelerating pricing leveraged recovering markets. Water fixed currency sales decreased 2% in 2020. Light industry water treatment sales had solid growth in 2021 and modest growth in 2020 led by good gains in food & beverage, light manufacturing and data centers. Heavy industry sales recorded a strong increase in 2021 driven by primary metals and were moderately lower in 2020, impacted by lower end market demand. Food & Beverage fixed currency sales increased 3% (2% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 primarily reflecting accelerating pricing, recovering markets and new business wins. Globally, we realized strong growth in beverage, brewing and modest growth in dairy. Fixed currency sales increased 5% (3% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as share gains and pricing more than offset generally flat industry trends. Downstream fixed currency sales decreased 3% and 8% in 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to lower demand from COVID and impacts from the Texas freeze and Hurricane Ida impacts in 2021, while substantial reductions in transportation fuel demand and additive use hurt 2020 results. Paper fixed currency sales increased 11% in 2021 driven by increased pricing, strong new business wins, and increased ecommerce activity. Fixed currency sales were flat in 2020 despite softer industrial containerboard market conditions which reduced volumes in major regions. Operating Income Fixed currency operating income and fixed currency operating income margins for Global Industrial decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 when compared to prior periods. ​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased 2.1 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020, as the 1.8 percentage point positive impact from accelerating pricing was more than offset by the 3.4 percentage point negative impact of significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of Texas Freeze and Hurricane Ida. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2020, as the favorable impacts of cost savings, pricing, lower delivered product costs and lower variable compensation more than offset the negative impact of lower volume. ​40 Table of ContentsGlobal Institutional & Specialty​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021​2020​2019Sales at fixed currency (millions)​​ $3,978.2​​​ $3,629.0​​​ $4,477.2​Sales at public currency (millions)​​ 3,955.9​​​ 3,562.5​​​ 4,416.1​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Volume​ 7% ​​ (21)% ​​​​Price changes​ 2% ​​ 2% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​​ 9% ​​ (20)% ​​​​Acquisitions and divestitures​ -% ​​ 1% ​​​​Fixed currency sales change​ 10% ​​ (19)% ​​​​Foreign currency translation​​ 1% ​​ -% ​​​​Public currency sales change​ 11% ​​ (19)% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income at fixed currency (millions)​​ $556.9​​​ $324.0​​​ $945.8​Operating income at public currency (millions)​​ 554.7​​​ 320.1​​​ 936.8​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fixed currency operating income change​​ 72% ​​ (66)% ​​​​Fixed currency operating income margin​ 14.0% ​ 8.9% ​ 21.1%Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income change​ 73% ​ (66)% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin​ 14.1% ​ 8.9% ​​*​Public currency operating income change​​ 73% ​​ (66)% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​* Not meaningfulAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Net Sales​Fixed currency sales for Global Institutional & Specialty increased in 2021 driven by strong growth in the Institutional operating segment reflecting recovering markets, new business wins including gains from the Ecolab Science Certified programs, innovation and accelerating pricing and decreased in 2020 driven by a significant decline in the Institutional business due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. At an operating segment level, Institutional fixed currency sales increased 15% in 2021, driven by strong growth in the Institutional operating segment reflecting recovering markets in the U.S. and Europe, new business wins including gains from the Ecolab Science Certified programs, innovation and accelerating pricing. Fixed currency sales decreased 27% in 2020, reflecting strong hand and surface hygiene sales that were more than offset by the negative effects of mandated reductions for in-unit dining and domestic and international travel that significantly reduced foot traffic at full-service restaurants, occupancy rates at hotels and customer visits to other entertainment facilities through the year. Specialty fixed currency sales decreased 3% in 2021, as modest quickservice sales growth were more than offset by lower food retail sales. Quickservice sales showed a modest gain as new business wins more than offset impacts of COVID-19 restrictions and labor shortages. Food retail sales declined versus the strong sanitizer demand in 2020 and customer labor shortages that has resulted in reduced in-store services and associated product usage. Fixed currency sales increased 8% (5% acquisition adjusted) in 2020, as strong food retail sales growth, benefiting from continued expanded cleaning protocols and frequency in the grocery stores in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and new customer additions, was partially offset by moderately lower quickservice sales, which saw strong hand and surface sanitizer sales more than offset by COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on restaurant volumes. ​Operating Income​Fixed currency operating income for our Global Institutional & Specialty segment increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2021 after decreasing in 2020.​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased 5.2 percentage points during 2021, as the 6.9 percentage point positive impact from higher volume, accelerating pricing, and favorable mix more than offset the 2.4 percentage point negative impact of the comparison to lower variable compensation last year and higher delivered product costs. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased during 2020 as margins were negatively impacted from volume declines, unfavorable mix and higher bad debt expense, which more than offset the positive impact of cost savings.​​​​41 Table of ContentsGlobal Healthcare & Life Sciences​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021​2020​2019Sales at fixed currency (millions)​​ $1,195.4​​​ $1,241.1​​​ $1,017.6​Sales at public currency (millions)​​ 1,181.6​​​ 1,185.5​​​ 974.1​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Volume​ (9)% ​​ 18% ​​​​Price changes​ 2% ​​ 1% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​​ (7)% ​​ 19% ​​​​Acquisitions and divestitures​ 3% ​​ 2% ​​​​Fixed currency sales change​ (4)% ​​ 21% ​​​​Foreign currency translation​​ 4% ​​ -% ​​​​Public currency sales change​ 0% ​​ 21% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income at fixed currency (millions)​​ $160.9​​​ $218.3​​​ $129.2​Operating income at public currency (millions)​​ 159.2​​​ 205.7​​​ 121.6​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fixed currency operating income change​​ (26)% ​​ 69% ​​​​Fixed currency operating income margin​ 13.5% ​ 17.6% ​ 12.7%Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income change​ (22)% ​ 67% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin​ 14.9% ​ 17.6% ​​*​Public currency operating income change​​ (23)% ​​ 69% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​* Not meaningfulAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Net Sales​Fixed currency sales decreased for Global Healthcare & Life Sciences in 2021 compared to a strong 2020 year when sales benefited from strong COVID-19 related demand and increased in 2020 as growth was driven by volume and pricing gains.​At an operating segment level, Healthcare fixed currency sales decreased 5% (8% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 reflecting the comparison against strong 2020 COVID-19 related hand and surface disinfection sales as well as softer elective surgical procedures activity in 2021 due to the rise in COVID variants during the year. Fixed currency sales increased 18% (16% acquisition adjusted) in 2020. Strong COVID-19 pandemic related hand and surface disinfection sales growth more than offset the unfavorable effects of delayed elective surgical procedures. Life Sciences fixed currency sales decreased 5% (4% acquisition adjusted) in 2021 as accelerating pricing was more than offset by volume declines versus the very strong 2020 driven by extraordinary COVID-19 demand last year. Fixed currency sales increased 35% in 2020, led by strong demand for biodecontamination units, business wins and pricing in our cleaning and disinfection programs for both the pharmaceutical and personal care markets, with strong growth in Europe and moderate North America gains. ​Operating Income​Fixed currency operating income for our Global Healthcare & Life Sciences segment decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 when compared to prior periods. Fixed currency operating income margins decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020. ​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins decreased 2.7 percentage points in 2021, as the 1.8 percentage point positive impact from accelerating pricing was more than offset by the 3.5 percentage point negative impact of volume declines due to strong comparison against last year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased in 2020 driven by strong volume gains, reduced discretionary spending and pricing, partially offset by negative impact of higher delivered product costs. ​​42 Table of ContentsOther​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 2021​2020​2019Sales at fixed currency (millions)​​ $1,226.9​​​ $1,103.4​​​ $1,220.5​Sales at public currency (millions)​​ 1,218.6​​​ 1,075.1​​​ 1,193.0​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Volume​ 9% ​​ (11)% ​​​​Price changes​ 2% ​​ 2% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​​ 11% ​​ (10)% ​​​​Acquisitions and divestitures​ -% ​​ -% ​​​​Fixed currency sales change​ 11% ​​ (10)% ​​​​Foreign currency translation​​ 2% ​​ -% ​​​​Public currency sales change​ 13% ​​ (10)% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income at fixed currency (millions)​​ $187.3​​​ $132.8​​​ $169.7​Operating income at public currency (millions)​​ 186.2​​​ 130.2​​​ 165.2​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Fixed currency operating income change​​ 41% ​​ (22)% ​​​​Fixed currency operating income margin​ 15.3% ​ 12.0% ​ 13.9%Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income change​ 41% ​ (21)% ​​​​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin​ 15.3% ​ 12.0% ​​*​Public currency operating income change​​ 43% ​​ (21)% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​* Not meaningfulAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Net Sales​Fixed currency sales for Other increased in 2021 led by strong growth in Pest Elimination as it benefited from new business wins and a recovering market.

Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​First​Second​Third​Fourth​ ​ ​​Quarter​Quarter​Quarter​Quarter​Year2021​​ $0.48​​​ $0.48​​​ $0.48​​​ $0.51​​​ $1.95​2020​ $0.47​​​ $0.47​​​ $0.47​​​ $0.48​​​ $1.89​2019​ $0.46​​​ $0.46​​​ $0.46​​​ $0.47​​​ $1.85​​​45 Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources​We currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.​As of December 31, 2021, we had $360 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $181 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,260 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $59 million was held outside of the U.S. We will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments.​As of December 31, 2021, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in April 2026. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. The maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our U.S. commercial paper program and our Euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year end, we had $400 million outstanding commercial paper under our U.S. program and no commercial paper outstanding on our Euro program. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. As of December 31, 2021, both programs were rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s, P-2 by Moody’s and F-1 by Fitch.​We had a $305 million term credit agreement which we drew on and repaid $303 million during the second quarter of 2020. The credit agreement expired in June 2020. ​Additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. These credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. We have $118 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.​As of December 31, 2021, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch both rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at A3 (stable outlook). A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures. A schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2021 are summarized in the following table:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payments Due by Period ​​​​​Less​​​​​​​More ​​​​​Than​2-3​4-5​Than (millions)​Total​1 Year​Years​Years​5 Years Notes payable​​$ 8​​$ 8 ​​​​​​​​​One-time transition tax​ 83​ ​​ 13​​ 70​ ​​Long-term debt​ 8,347​ 2​ 1,150​ 1,396​ 5,799​Operating leases​ 450​ 138​ 157​​ 74​ 81​Interest*​ 3,644​ 234​ 456​ 418​ 2,536​Total​​$ 12,532​​$ 382​​$ 1,776​​$ 1,958​​$ 8,416​​*Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year end 2021.​As of December 31, 2021, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2021. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $49 million in 2022. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles. ​46 Table of ContentsMarket Risk​We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges. ​We enter into cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain Euro denominated exposures from our investments in certain of its Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had €425 million of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge. ​We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,250 million of interest rate swaps outstanding. Refer to Note 9 for further information on our hedging activity. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $278 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.​​GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT ​COVID-19​In March 2020, the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to affect major economic and financial markets and industries are facing the challenges with the economic conditions resulting from efforts to address the pandemic, including supply shortages, inflation and other challenges, such as those resulting from the introduction of vaccination mandates. While many government restrictions in the U.S. have eased throughout 2021, restrictions on activities continue in many other regions, particularly those where vaccination rates lag, continuing to impact consumer activity in those regions. Concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions on activity, for example due to the emergence of a variant against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted, particularly to those unvaccinated. These conditions have had and will continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world. ​We expect continued, if uneven, global economic recovery. We have also experienced continued substantial delivered product cost inflation. While we expect the challenges that affected us and the rest of the world in the fourth quarter to continue into the first quarter of 2022, assuming the rate of cost inflation and COVID impacts ease progressively in the second half of the year, we believe our continued actions should help us deliver improved results in 2022. ​Global Economies​Approximately half of our sales are outside of the U.S. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.​Argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and increasing borrowing rates. Argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. During 2021, sales in Argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. Assets held in Argentina at the end of 2021 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.​In February 2022, the U.S. and the European Union responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions. The U.S. and other countries could impose wider sanctions or take further actions if the conflict escalates. While it is difficult to anticipate the impact the sanctions may have on Ecolab, any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the U.S. or other countries, or any retaliatory measures by Russia in response, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations. During 2021, net sales to Russia and Ukraine were approximately 1% of consolidated net sales.​​NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS​Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.47 Table of ContentsNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES​This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include: ● Fixed currency sales● Adjusted net sales● Adjusted fixed currency sales● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales● Adjusted cost of sales● Adjusted gross margin● Fixed currency operating income● Fixed currency operating income margin● Adjusted operating income● Adjusted operating income margin● Adjusted fixed currency operating income● Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income ● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin ● Adjusted other (income) expense ●Adjusted interest expense, net● EBITDA● Adjusted tax rate● Adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax● Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab● Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations​We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measure for net sales excludes Purolite sales. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income, other (income) expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and (with the exception of other (income) expense) the impact of the Purolite transaction, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges. EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. ​We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2021. We also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for international purposes.​Our reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the Nalco merger or the impact of special (gains) and charges as these are not allocated to the Company’s reportable segments.​Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. In addition, as part of the separation, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.​These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts.​​​48 Table of ContentsItem 7A.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.​The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.​The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled “Results of Operations” of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP.​​26 Table of ContentsComparability of Results​Purolite acquisition​In December 2021, we acquired Purolite for total consideration of $3.7 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. Purolite is a leading and fast-growing global provider of high-end ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. Headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Purolite operates in more than 30 countries. Purolite is reported within our Life Sciences operating segment. Acquisition and integration charges are recorded within special (gains) and charges. The 2021 impacts of the Purolite acquisition including operating results, acquisition-related amortization and interest expense related to the transaction were also excluded from 2021 adjusted results. ​ChampionX Transaction​In June 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our Upstream Energy business (the “ChampionX business”) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “Transaction”) through the split-off of ChampionX Holding Inc. (“ChampionX”), formed by Ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the ChampionX Business, followed immediately by the merger of ChampionX (the “Merger”) with a wholly owned subsidiary of ChampionX Corporation (f/k/a Apergy Corporation, “Apergy”). ​The ChampionX business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of ChampionX was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, we reported the historical results of ChampionX, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for 2020. Unless otherwise noted, the accompanying MD&A has been revised to reflect the ChampionX business as discontinued operations and 2020 balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only. ​Comparability of Reportable Segments​We have also made immaterial changes to our segment reporting, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments. ​Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures​Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. Further, we have excluded the results of our Purolite business for all of 2022 to remain comparable to 2021 when Purolite’s results were excluded from adjusted results. As part of the separation of the ChampionX business, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.​Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates​Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.​​​27 Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARY​In 2022, we delivered double-digit sales growth as we accelerated our pricing and drove volume growth. Our strong pricing increases offset continued significant delivered product cost increases on a dollar basis. Our team generated double-digit sales growth in the Institutional & Specialty, Industrial and Other segments while Healthcare & Life Sciences segment sales were stable. Operating income was stable, as accelerating pricing was offset by higher delivered product costs and investments in the business.​Sales​Reported sales increased 11% to $14.2 billion in 2022 from $12.7 billion in 2021. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 16% compared to the prior year. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 13% compared to the prior year.​Gross Margin​Our reported gross margin was 37.8% of sales for 2022, compared to our 2021 reported gross margin of 40.2%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the 2021 impacts from the Purolite transaction included in cost of sales, our adjusted gross margin was 38.2% in 2022 and 40.9% in 2021. Our gross profit increased as our strong pricing exceeded substantial delivered product cost inflation. ​Operating Income ​Reported operating income remained stable at $1.6 billion in 2022, compared to $1.6 billion in 2021. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the 2021 impacts of the Purolite transaction, decreased 1% in 2022, as strong pricing offset substantial delivered product inflation and investments in the business. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 4% in 2022. ​Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”) ​Reported diluted EPS decreased 3% to $3.81 in 2022 compared to $3.91 in 2021. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2022 were driven primarily by restructuring and pension settlement expense and 2021 was driven primarily by COVID-19 related charges, restructuring charges and pension settlement expense. Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the 2021 impacts of the Purolite transaction and discrete tax items decreased 4% to $4.49 in 2022 compared to $4.69 in 2021, as unfavorable foreign currency translation and increases in interest expense further offset our operating income performance. ​Balance Sheet​We remain committed to maintaining “A” range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/A3/A- by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.​Cash Flow​Cash flow from continuing operations operating activities was $1.8 billion in 2022 compared to $2.1 billion in 2021. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. ​Dividends ​Dividends declared per common share in 2022 was $2.06 per share. In December 2022 we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 4% to $0.53 per share, representing our 31st consecutive annual dividend rate increase. We have paid cash dividends on our common shares for 86 consecutive years. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.​​​​28 Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES​Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”).​Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.​In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial information as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected. ​Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:​Revenue Recognition​Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 842 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.​Our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. We record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses. ​The revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. For additional information on revenue recognition, refer to Note 18.​29 Table of ContentsLitigation and Environmental Liabilities​Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.​We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 16.​Actuarially Determined Liabilities​Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans​The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future pension contributions, benefit payments and expense or income recognized.​The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rates, expected returns on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality tables.​●The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bonds that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings. The discount rates are calculated by matching each plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2022 and 2021, we measured service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2022, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 5.17% from 2.86% at year-end 2021. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2022, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 5.14% from 2.75% at year-end 2021.​●The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected returns on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.00% for 2022, 7.00% for 2021 and 7.25% for 2020.​●Projected salary is based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the U.S. pension expenses was 4.03% for 2022, 2021 and 2020. ​●For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2022, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs. Post-65 costs are no longer used. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 4.5% in 2032 and remain at those levels thereafter.​●The Company uses mortality tables appropriate in the circumstances, which generally are the recently available mortality tables as of the respective U.S. and international measurement dates. Our year-end U.S. valuations reflect mortality tables that estimate the impacts of COVID in an endemic state. This represents a change from prior year when the impact of COVID on future mortality could not be reasonably estimated.​The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized gains or losses and amortized into earnings in the future. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and income or expense. The unrecognized net losses on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans increased to $412 million as of December 31, 2022 from $397 million as of December 31, 2021 (both before tax), primarily due to lower actual return on assets partially offset by current year net actuarial gains.30 Table of ContentsThe effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2022, on the December 31, 2022 defined benefit obligation and 2023 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels. Expense amounts reflect the accounting for gains or losses as a component of other comprehensive income or expense and recognition of the impacts into earnings over time:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Effect on U.S. Pension Plans​​​​Increase in​Higher​​Assumption​Recorded​2023(millions)​Change​Obligation​ExpenseDiscount rate -.25 pts​​ $42.4​​​ $1.1​Expected return on assets -.25 pts​​N/A​​​ (4.7)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Effect on U.S. Postretirement​​Health Care Benefits Plans​​​​Increase in​Higher​​Assumption​Recorded​2023(millions)​Change​Obligation​ExpenseDiscount rate -.25 pts ​ $2.7​ ​ $-​Expected return on assets -.25 pts​ N/A​​​ -​​Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.​Refer to Note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.​Self-Insurance​Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. ​Income Taxes​Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.​Effective Income Tax Rate​Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. ​Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.​Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances​Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. ​31 Table of ContentsUncertain Tax Positions​A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a liability for uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 through 2020 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.​The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have estabilished a liability for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The liability for uncertain tax positions is reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $24.9 million and $25.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For additional information on income taxes refer to Note 13.​Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill​Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets​Purchased long-lived and amortizable intangible assets not acquired as part of a business combination are recorded as of their acquisition date at cost, whereas long-lived and amortizable assets acquired as part of a business combination are recorded as of their acquisition date at their fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in U.S. GAAP. This requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows, such as growth rates, royalty rates or discount rates.​We review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.3 billion and $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s or assets group’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. ​We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.​Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our Nalco, Anios, CID Lines and Purolite transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rates, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. If our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impacts and significance of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization expense.​In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.​Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets​Goodwill arises from our acquisitions and represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration exchanged over the fair value of net assets acquired. We had total goodwill of $8.0 billion and $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are largely our operating segments. Following the acquisition of Purolite on December 1, 2021, our Life Sciences Operating Segment consists of the Purolite and Global Life Sciences Reporting Units. We assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the second quarter. If circumstances change or events occur that demonstrate it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we complete an interim goodwill impairment assessment of that reporting unit prior to the next annual assessment. If the results of an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment demonstrate the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. ​32 Table of ContentsFor our annual 2022 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed our impairment assessment for eleven of our twelve reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values and discount rates. Our goodwill impairment assessments for 2022 indicated the estimated fair values of each of these eleven reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin. Given the recent acquisition of Purolite, our annual goodwill impairment assessment of the Purolite Reporting Unit was qualitative in nature and considered information regarding its operations, financial performance and the macroeconomic environment. After weighting both positive and negative information, it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Purolite Reporting Unit exceeds its carrying amount. We evaluate the need to complete interim goodwill impairment assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be higher than its fair value. No events were noted during the second half of 2022 that required completion of an interim goodwill impairment assessment in the second half of 2022 for any of our twelve reporting units. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented. ​The Nalco trade name is our only indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the second quarter. For our annual 2022 indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment, we completed our impairment assessment of the Nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. Our Nalco tradename impairment assessment for 2022 indicated the estimated fair value of the Nalco trade name exceeded its $1.2 billion carrying amount by a significant margin. No events were noted during the second half of 2022 that required completion of an interim impairment assessment of our Nalco trade name in the second half of 2022. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired. ​​RESULTS OF OPERATIONS​Net Sales​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​2022​2021​2020​2022​2021Product and equipment sales​​ $11,446.2​ ​ $10,153.3​ ​ $9,466.6​ ​​​​​Service and lease sales​​ 2,741.6​​​ 2,579.8​​​ 2,323.6​​​​​​​Reported GAAP net sales​​ 14,187.8​​​ 12,733.1​​​ 11,790.2​​ 11% ​ 8%2021 impact of Purolite on net sales​​ -​​​ 12.0​​​ -​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted net sales​​ 14,187.8​​​ 12,721.1​​​ 11,790.2​​ 12% ​ 8%Effect of foreign currency translation​ 285.3​ (249.5)​​ (15.4)​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency sales​​ $14,473.1​​​ $12,471.6​​​ $11,774.8​​ 16% ​ 6%​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​The percentage components of the year-over-year sales change are shown below:​​​​​​​​​​​(percent)​2022​2021Volume​ ​2 % ​ 3 % Price changes​ ​10 ​​ 2 ​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales change​ ​13 ​​ 5 ​Acquisitions & divestitures​ ​3 ​​ 1 ​Fixed currency sales change​ ​16 ​​ 6 ​Foreign currency translation​ ​(4)​​ 2 ​Reported GAAP net sales change​ ​11 % ​ 8 % ​Amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Cost of Sales (“COS”) and Gross Profit Margin (“Gross Margin”)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2022​2021​2020​​​​ Gross​​​​ Gross​​​​ Gross(millions/percent)​COS​​Margin​​COS​​Margin​​COS​​MarginProduct and equipment cost of sales​ $7,212.8​​​​​​ $6,100.9​​​​​​ $5,481.3​​​​Service and lease cost of sales​ 1,618.2​​​​​​ 1,514.9​​​​​​ 1,424.5​​​​Reported GAAP COS and gross margin​ 8,831.0​​37.8 % ​​ 7,615.8​​40.2 %​​ 6,905.8​​41.4 %Special (gains) and charges​ 69.9​​​​​​ 93.9​​​​​​ 48.2​ ​​2021 impact of Purolite on COS​ -​​​​​​ 7.6​​​​​​ -​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted COS and gross margin​ $8,761.1​​38.2 % ​​ $7,514.3​​40.9 %​​ $6,857.6​​41.8 %​Our COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown above.

Our 2022, 2021 and 2020 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $69.9 million, $93.9 million, and $48.2 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the “Special (Gains) and Charges” table below.​Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the 2021 impacts of the Purolite transaction, our 2022 adjusted gross margin was 38.2% compared against a 2021 adjusted gross margin of 40.9%. The decrease primarily reflected accelerating pricing that was more than offset by higher delivered product cost and unfavorable mix.​Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the 2021 impacts of the Purolite transaction, our adjusted gross margin was 40.9% and 41.8% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease primarily reflected increased pricing and higher volumes which were more than offset by significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints.​Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2022​2021​2020SG&A Ratio 25.8% ​26.8 % ​28.1 %​The decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2022 against 2021 was driven primarily by strong productivity including cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher cost of compensation compared to last year. The decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by higher net sales, cost savings initiatives and reduction in bad debt, partially offset by higher variable compensation compared to last year.​Special (Gains) and Charges​Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income included the following items:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​2022​2021​2020Cost of sales​​​​​​​​​​​​Restructuring activities​ $21.4​​ $24.7​​​ $7.4​Acquisition and integration activities​​ 25.0​​​ 4.2​​​ 3.9​COVID-19 activities, net​​ 16.3​​​ 64.7​​​ 12.5​Russia/Ukraine​​ 7.2​​​ -​​​ -​Other​​ -​​​ 0.3​​​ 24.4​Cost of sales subtotal​ 69.9​​ 93.9​ 48.2​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges​​​​​​​​​​​​Restructuring activities​ 85.8​​ 11.9​​​ 71.4​Acquisition and integration activities​​ 14.5​​​ 29.9​​​ 8.5​Disposal and impairment activities​​ -​​​ -​​​ 41.4​COVID-19 activities, net​​ 10.2​​​ 42.4​​​ 23.6​Russia/Ukraine​​ 5.9​​​ -​​​ -​Other​ 24.1​​ 18.4​​​ 34.7​Special (gains) and charges subtotal​ 140.5​​ 102.6​ 179.6​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Operating income subtotal​​ 210.4​​​ 196.5​​​ 227.8​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Other (income) expense​​ 50.6​​​ 37.2​​​ 0.4​Interest expense, net​​ -​​​ 33.1​​​ 83.8​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Total special (gains) and charges​​ $261.0​​​ $266.8​​​ $312.0​​For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.​Restructuring Activities​Restructuring activities are primarily related to the Europe Program, Institutional Advancement Program, Accelerate 2020 and other immaterial restructuring programs which are described below. These activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.​Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.​​​​​34 Table of ContentsEurope Program​In November 2022 we approved a Europe Program (the “Europe Program”) targeting $80 million of annualized pre-tax savings after completion of the program. In connection with these actions, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of $130 million ($110 million after tax) or $0.38 per diluted share. The Europe Program charges are expected to be primarily cash expenditures related to severance and asset disposals. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.​In 2022 we recorded total restructuring charges of $67.2 million ($56.0 million after tax) or $0.20 per diluted share primarily related to severance. The liability related to the Europe Program was $62.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. ​The Europe Program has delivered $5 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $80 million in continuing operations by 2024. ​On February 14, 2023, we expanded our previously announced Europe cost savings program to focus on our Institutional and Healthcare businesses in other regions. In connection with the expanded program, we now expect to incur pre-tax charges of $195 million ($150 million after tax) or $0.52 per diluted share. We expect that these restructuring actions will be completed by 2024. Program actions include headcount reductions from terminations, not filing certain positions and facility closures. The expanded program charges are expected to be primarily cash expenditures related to severance and asset disposals. We now expect an estimated annual total cost savings of $175 million by 2024.​Institutional Advancement Program​We approved a restructuring plan in 2020 focused on the Institutional business (“the Institutional Plan”) which is intended to enhance our Institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. In February 2021, we expanded the Institutional Plan, and expect that these restructuring charges will be completed in 2023, with total anticipated costs of $70 million ($55 million after tax) or $0.19 per diluted share. The remaining costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and non-cash costs related to equipment disposals. Actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken. ​In 2022 and 2021, we recorded total restructuring charges of $6.3 million ($4.8 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and $12.6 million ($10.2 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share, respectively, primarily related to severance, disposals of equipment and office closures. We have recorded $54.1 million ($41.4 million after tax), or $0.14 per diluted share of cumulative restructuring charges under the Institutional Plan. The liability related to the Institutional Plan was $1.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. ​The Institutional Plan has delivered $49 million of cumulative cost savings. ​Accelerate 2020​During 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan Accelerate 2020 (“the A2020 Plan”), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. The goals of the Plan are to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. During 2020, we expanded the Plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements. We completed the plan with actual costs of $254 million ($198 million after tax), or $0.69 per diluted share. ​We recorded restructuring charges of $9.9 million ($8.4 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share, $5.3 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and $41.8 million ($33.0 million after tax) or $0.11 per diluted share in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of these expenses, $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share during 2020 is recorded in other (income) expense and related to pension settlements and curtailments. The liability related to the Plan was $18.1 million and $32.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have recorded $254.4 million ($198.4 million after tax), or $0.69 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the Plan. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.​The Accelerate 2020 Plan has delivered $315 million of cumulative cost savings.​Other Restructuring Activities​During 2022, we incurred restructuring charges of $23.8 million ($17.9 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring activity. The charges primarily related to severance and asset write-offs. ​During 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of $18.7 million ($17.0 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring activity. The charges primarily related to severance and asset write-offs.​During 2020, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.8 million ($1.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, related to other immaterial restructuring plan. The charges are comprised of severance, facility closure costs, including asset disposals, and consulting fees. ​35 Table of ContentsThe restructuring liability balance for all other restructuring plans excluding the Europe Program, A2020 Plan and the Institutional Plan were $23.2 million and $4.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in liability was driven primarily by severance expense. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2022 related to all other restructuring plans excluding the Europe Program, A2020 and Institutional Plan were $5.2 million.​Acquisition and integration related costs​Acquisition and integration related costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022 include $14.5 million ($11.4 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share. Charges are related primarily to the Purolite Corporation (“Purolite”) acquisition and consist of integration related costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration related costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022 include $25.0 million ($19.6 million after tax) or $0.07 per diluted share. Charges are related primarily to the recognition of fair value step-up in the Purolite inventory and other integration costs. ​Acquisition and integration related costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $29.9 million ($23.5 million after tax) or $0.08 per diluted share. Charges are primarily related to the Purolite acquisition and consisted of deal costs, integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration related costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021 include $4.2 million ($3.3 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the Purolite inventory. In conjunction with its acquisitions, we incurred $0.8 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2021.​Acquisition and integration related costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2020 include $8.5 million ($6.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share. Charges are related to Copal Invest NV, including its primary operating entity CID Lines (collectively, “CID Lines”), Bioquell PLC (“Bioquell”) and the Laboratoires Anios (“Anios”) acquisitions and consist of integration costs and advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration related costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2020 include $3.9 million ($3.2 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share and are related to the recognition of fair value step-up in the CID Lines inventory, severance and the closure of a facility. In conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.7 million ($0.6 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of special (gains) and charges reported in interest expense in 2020. ​Disposal and impairment charges​Disposal and impairment charges reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income include $41.4 million ($41.5 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share in the 2020. During 2020, we recorded a $28.6 million ($28.6 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share impairment for a minority equity method investment due to the COVID-19 impact on the economic environment and the liquidity of the minority equity method investment. In addition, we recorded charges of $12.8 million ($12.9 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share related to the disposal of Holchem Group Limited (“Holchem”) for the loss on sale and related transaction fees during 2020. Further information related to the disposal is included in Note 4. ​COVID-19 activities​We have recorded inventory reserves of $15 million and $60 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, for excess sanitizer inventory and estimated disposal costs. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $2.4 million, $36.8 million and $57.1 million, respectively, to protect the wages of certain employees directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also recorded charges of $9.8 million, $16.5 million and $2.4 million related to employee COVID-19 testing and related expenses during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we received subsidies and government assistance, which were recorded as a special (gain) of ($0.7) million, ($6.2) million and ($23.4) million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. COVID-19 pandemic charges are recorded in product and equipment cost of sales, service and lease cost of sales, and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Total after tax net charges related to COVID-19 pandemic were $20.2 million or $0.07 per diluted share, $81.3 million or $0.28 per diluted share and $27.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.​Russia/Ukraine​In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia by the United States and other countries, we have made the determination that we will limit our Russian business to operations that are essential to life, providing minimal support for our healthcare, life sciences, food and beverage and certain water businesses. We incurred charges of $13.1 million ($12.6 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share during 2022, primarily related to recoverability risk of certain assets in both Russia and Ukraine.​Other operating activities ​Other special charges of $24.1 million ($18.2 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share in 2022, $18.4 million ($14.1 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share in 2021 and $34.7 million ($33.9 million after tax) or $0.12 per diluted share recorded in 2020 relate primarily to certain legal charges, which are recorded in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2020, we recorded special charges of $24.4 million ($16.0 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to a Healthcare product recall in Europe.​36 Table of ContentsWe also recorded during 2020 a $7.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, special charge related to the separation of ChampionX as a tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.​Other (income) expense​During 2022 and 2021, we incurred settlement expense recorded in other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $50.6 million ($38.2 million after tax) or $0.13 per diluted share and $37.2 million ($28.7 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share, respectively, related to U.S. pension plan lump-sum payments to retirees.​Interest expense, net​During 2021 and 2020, we recorded special charges of $32.3 million ($28.4 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share and $83.1 million ($64.0 million after tax) or $0.22 per diluted share, respectively, in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to debt issuance and refinancing charges. ​Operating Income and Operating Income Margin​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​ ​​Percent Change​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2022 2021 2020​​2022​2021Reported GAAP operating income​​ $1,562.5​​​ $1,598.6​​​ $1,395.7​​​​ (2)% ​​ 15% Special (gains) and charges ​ 210.4​​​ 196.5​​​ 227.8​​​ ​​​ ​​2021 impact of Purolite on operating income​​​​​​ 3.8​​​ -​​​​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted operating income ​ 1,772.9​​​ 1,798.9​​​ 1,623.5​​​ (1)​​ 11​Effect of foreign currency translation ​ 50.1​​​ (47.5)​​​ (9.8)​​​ ​​​ ​​Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income ​​ $1,823.0​​​ $1,751.4​​​ $1,613.7​​​​ 4% ​​ 9% ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2022​2021​2020​​​​​​​Reported GAAP operating income margin​​11.0% ​​ 12.6% ​​ 11.8% ​​​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin​​12.5% ​​ 14.1% ​​ 13.8% ​​​​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin ​​12.6% ​​ 14.0% ​​ 13.7% ​​​​​​​​​​Our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables. Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales.​Our reported operating income decreased 2% when comparing 2022 to 2021 primarily driven by accelerating pricing covering substantially higher delivered product costs, which was offset by investments in the business. Our reported operating income increased 15% when comparing 2021 to 2020 primarily driven by increased pricing and higher volume which more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints and higher variable compensation compared to last year. Our reported operating income for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the 2021 impacts of the Purolite transaction, 2022 adjusted operating income decreased 1% when compared to 2021 adjusted operating income and 2021 adjusted operating income increased 11% when compared to 2020 adjusted operating income. ​Other (Income) Expense​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2022 2021 2020Reported GAAP other (income) expense​​ ($24.5)​​​ ($33.9)​​​ ($55.9)Special (gains) and charges​​ 50.6​​ 37.2​​ 0.4Non-GAAP adjusted other (income) expense​​ ($75.1)​​​ ($71.1)​​​ ($56.3)​Our reported other income was $24.5 million, $33.9 million and $55.9 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other (income) expense decreased when comparing 2022 against 2021 primarily due to increased pension settlement charges in 2022 as a result of a higher volume of pension settlement activity and higher interest costs associated with rising interest rates throughout 2022. Other (income) expense decreased when comparing 2021 against 2020 reflecting lower interest costs associated with future payments of employee pension obligations. Excluding the impact of settlements and curtailments recorded in special (gains) and charges during 2022, 2021 and 2020, our adjusted other income was $75.1 million, $71.1 million and $56.3 million, respectively.​​37 Table of ContentsInterest Expense, Net​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2022 2021 2020Reported GAAP interest expense, net​​ $243.6​​​ $218.3​​​ $290.2Special (gains) and charges​​ -​​ 33.1​​ 83.82021 impact of Purolite on interest expense​​ -​​​ 3.5​​​ -Non-GAAP adjusted interest expense, net​​ $243.6​​​ $181.7​​​ $206.4​Our reported net interest expense totaled $243.6 million, $218.3 million and $290.2 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.​We incurred $33.1 million ($29.0 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share and $83.8 million ($64.6 million after tax) or $0.22 per diluted share, of interest expense special charges in conjunction with our debt issuances and refinancing activities during 2021 and 2020, respectively.​Adjusted for special (gains) and charges, the increase in interest expense when comparing 2022 against 2021 was driven primarily by the interest on debt issued to fund the Purolite acquisition and the impact from higher average interest rates on floating rate debt. Adjusted for special (gains) and charges and the 2021 Purolite transaction, the decrease in interest expense when comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by a reduction in average debt levels and average interest rates. ​Provision for Income Taxes​The following table provides a summary of our tax rate:​​​​​​​​​​​(percent) 2022​2021 2020Reported GAAP tax rate​ 17.5%​19.1 % ​15.2 % Tax rate impact of:​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges 0.5​​0.1 0.7 Discrete tax items​ 0.7​​(0.3)​​3.8 ​Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 18.7%​ 18.9% 19.7% ​Our reported tax rate was 17.5%, 19.1%, and 15.2%, for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. ​We recognized a net tax benefit related to discrete tax items of $11.8 million during 2022. This included a deferred tax benefit of $14.6 million associated with utilization of tax attributes as a result of legal entity rationalization and share-based compensation excess tax benefits of $6.0 million. The amount of the excess tax benefit is subject to variation in stock price and award exercises. The remaining discrete tax expense of $8.8 million was primarily related to the filing of federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax laws, audit settlements and other changes in estimates.​We recognized net tax expense of $5.8 million related to discrete tax items during 2021. This included a non-cash deferred tax expense of $25.1 million associated with transferring certain intangible property between affiliates. Share-based compensation excess tax benefit was $29.1 million. The remaining discrete tax expense of $9.8 million was primarily related to the filing of federal, state, and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax law, audit settlements and other changes in estimates.​We recognized a total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $55.8 million during 2020. The tax benefit related to share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $57.3 million. We recorded changes in reserves in non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitations which resulted in a $9.8 million tax benefit. Additionally, we recognized a net tax expense of $11.3 million primarily related to the filing of the prior year federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments. ​The change in our adjusted tax rates from 2020 to 2022 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix. ​​38 Table of ContentsNet Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2022 2021 2020Reported GAAP net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax​​ $-​​​ $-​​​ ($2,172.5)Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges​​ -​​​ -​​​ 2,210.7Discrete tax net expense​​ -​​ -​​ 22.7Non-GAAP adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax​​ $-​​​ $-​​​ $60.9​Special charges reported in discontinued operations consist of ChampionX separation charges.​Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022​2021Reported GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab​​ $1,091.7​​​ $1,129.9​​ $967.4​ (3)%​ 17%Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges, after tax​ 207.3​​​ 213.5​​ 254.1​​​​​​Discrete tax net (benefit) expense​​ (11.8)​​​ 5.8​​ (55.8)​​​​​​2021 impact of Purolite on net income​ -​​​ 5.6​​ -​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab​​ $1,287.2​​​ $1,354.8​​ $1,165.7​ (5)%​ 16%​Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Percent Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(dollars) 2022 2021 2020 2022​2021Reported GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations​​ $3.81​​​ $3.91​​ $3.33​ (3)%​ 17%Adjustments:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Special (gains) and charges, after tax​ 0.72​​ 0.74​ 0.88​​​​​​Discrete tax net (benefit) expense​ (0.04)​​ 0.02​ (0.19)​​​​​​2021 impact of Purolite on diluted EPS​​ -​​​ 0.02​​ -​​​​​​Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations​​ $4.49​​​ $4.69​​ $4.02​ (4)%​ 17%​Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.​Currency translation had an unfavorable $(0.26) impact on reported and adjusted diluted EPS when comparing 2022 to 2021 and favorable $0.11 impact when comparing 2021 to 2020. ​39 Table of ContentsSEGMENT PERFORMANCE​The non-U.S. dollar functional currency international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates established by management for 2022.

Our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth. Financing Activities​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Dollar Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions) 2022​2021 2020 2022 2021Cash provided by (used for) financing activities​​ ($837.3)​​​ $1,603.2​​​ ($340.2)​​​ ($2,440.5)​​​ $1,943.4​​Our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and dividend payments.​We issued $500 million par value and received $494 million in proceeds of long-term debt. We issued $2,800 million par value and received $2,775 million in proceeds of long-term debt and repaid $900 million of long-term debt in 2021. We issued $1,850 million par value and received $1,856 million in proceeds of long-term debt and repaid $1,570 million of long-term debt in 2020. The proceeds received from the debt issuances were used for the Purolite acquisition, repayment of outstanding debt, repayment of commercial paper and general corporate purposes. In addition, we had net repayments of $404 million and net issuances $394 million of commercial paper and notes payable in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and net repayments of $66 million in 2020. Shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. We repurchased a total of $518 million, $107 million, and $146 million of shares in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ​The impact on financing cash flows of commercial paper and notes payable repayments, long-term debt borrowings and long-term debt repayments, are shown in the following table: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Dollar Change ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(millions)​2022​2021 2020 2022 2021Net (repayments) issuances of commercial paper and notes payable​ ($404.3)​​​ $393.6​ ​ ($65.5)​​ ($797.9)​ ​ $459.1​Long-term debt borrowings​ 494.0​​ 2,775.0​​ 1,855.9​​ (2,281.0)​​ 919.1​Long-term debt repayments​ -​​ (1,017.9)​​ (1,570.0)​​ 1,017.9​​ 552.1​ In December 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 4%. This represents the 31st consecutive year we have increased our dividend. We have paid dividends on our common stock for 86th consecutive years. We paid dividends of $603 million, $566 million and $561 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​First​Second​Third​Fourth​ ​ ​​Quarter​Quarter​Quarter​Quarter​Year2022​​ $0.51​​​ $0.51​​​ $0.51​​​ $0.53​​​ $2.06​2021​ $0.48​​​ $0.48​​​ $0.48​​​ $0.51​​​ $1.95​2020​ $0.47​​​ $0.47​​​ $0.47​​​ $0.48​​​ $1.89​​​46 Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources​We currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.​As of December 31, 2022, we had $599 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $122 million was held outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, we had $360 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $181 million was held outside of the U.S. We will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments.​As of December 31, 2022, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in April 2026. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. The maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our U.S. commercial paper program and our Euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year end, we had no commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. program or our Euro program. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. As of December 31, 2022, both programs were rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s, P-2 by Moody’s and F-1 by Fitch.​Additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. These credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. As of December 31, 2022 we had $144 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.​As of December 31, 2022, Standard & Poor’s, Fitch and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at A- (negative outlook), A- (stable outlook) and A3 (negative outlook), respectively. A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures. A schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2022 are summarized in the following table:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Payments Due by Period ​​​​​Less​​​​​​​More ​​​​​Than​2-3​4-5​Than (millions)​Total​1 Year​Years​Years​5 Years Notes payable​​ $4​​ $4 ​ $-​​ $-​​ $-​One-time transition tax​ 67​ -​ 35​​ 32​ -​Long-term debt​ 8,577​ 501​ 1,204​ 1,651​ 5,221​Operating leases​ 503​ 124​ 173​​ 85​ 121​Interest*​ 3,970​ 280​​ 529​ 467​ 2,694​Total​​ $13,121​​ $909​​ $1,941​​ $2,235​​ $8,036​​*Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year end 2022.​As of December 31, 2022, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2022. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $41 million in 2023. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations. We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles. Market Risk​We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows. 47 Table of ContentsWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges. ​We enter into cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain Euro denominated exposures from our investments in certain of its Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had €625 million of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge. ​We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1,500 million of interest rate swaps outstanding. Refer to Note 9 for further information on our hedging activity. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $220 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.​​GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT ​Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)​In March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to affect major economic and financial markets and industries are facing the challenges with the economic conditions resulting from efforts to address the pandemic, including supply shortages, inflation and other challenges, such as those resulting from the introduction of vaccination mandates. While many government restrictions in the U.S. have eased, restrictions on activities continue in many other regions, particularly those where vaccination rates lag, continuing to impact consumer activity in those regions. Concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions on activity, for example due to the emergence of a variant against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted, particularly to those unvaccinated. These conditions have had and may continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world. ​Global Economies​Approximately half of our sales are outside of the U.S. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results. We expect a more challenging macroeconomic environment, especially in Europe, as the war and the energy crisis are having a significant impact on costs and demand. We also assume continued high delivered product costs and unfavorable currency translation and interest rate impacts that persist well into 2023. ​Argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. During 2022, sales in Argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated net sales. Assets held in Argentina at the end of 2022 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets. Turkey was also classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with U.S. GAAP. During 2022, sales in Turkey represented less than 1% of our consolidated net sales. Assets held in Turkey at the end of 2022 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets. ​In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia by the United States and other countries, we have made the determination that we will limit our Russian business to operations that are essential to life, providing minimal support for our healthcare, life sciences, food and beverage and certain water businesses. We may further narrow our presence in Russia depending on future developments. Our Russian and Ukraine operations represented approximately 1% of our 2022 consolidated net sales. We recorded charges of $13.1 million in 2022 primarily related to recoverability risk of certain assets in both Russia and Ukraine. ​​NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS​Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.​​48 Table of ContentsNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES​This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include: ● Fixed currency sales● Adjusted net sales● Adjusted fixed currency sales● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales or organic sales● Adjusted cost of sales● Adjusted gross margin● Fixed currency operating income● Fixed currency operating income margin● Adjusted operating income● Adjusted operating income margin● Adjusted fixed currency operating income● Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income or organic income● Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin or organic margin● Adjusted other (income) expense● Adjusted interest expense, net● EBITDA● Adjusted tax rate● Adjusted net income from discontinued operations, net of tax● Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab● Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations​We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measure for net sales excludes 2021 Purolite sales. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income, other (income) expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and (with the exception of other (income) expense) the 2021 impact of the Purolite transaction, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income from continuing operations attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges. EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. ​We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2022. We also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for informational purposes.​Our reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the Nalco and Purolite transactions or the impact of special (gains) and charges as these are not allocated to our reportable segments.​Acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth rates, also known as organic growth rates, are at fixed currency and exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. Further, we have excluded the results of our Purolite business for all of 2022 to remain comparable to 2021 when Purolite’s results were excluded from our adjusted results. In addition, as part of the Transaction, we also entered into a Master Cross Supply and Product Transfer agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. Sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.​These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts in this MD&A.​​​​49 Table of ContentsItem 7A.
